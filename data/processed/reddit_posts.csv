1lngvg0,2025-06-29,"The NVDA journey has just begun
Nvidia is at the centre of the AI revolution, with breakthrough products and great opportunities ahead that continue to exceed my expectations.

Recent innovations such as the Blackwell GB200 NVL72 and expanding AI applications, including robotics, solidify Nvidia's dominant market position and growth potential.

Despite a record valuation, Nvidia's history of growing profits at a rate above valuation is unlikely to end.

I remain a committed long-term buyer of NVDA and I believe that Nvidia's leadership in AI and data centre technology makes it a must-have stock, despite the short-term risks.

How about now? NVIDIA's stock price and valuation just hit an all-time high, and many investors are wondering if NVIDIA is overvalued. Maybe they should take profits? Surely we'll see some short sellers active. For me, the journey has just begun. Since my recent article NVIDIA has announced some significant partnerships and at the recent GTC Paris conference its CEO made it clear to me that the growth story behind AI is continuing to accelerate. Let me bring you up to speed while we review whether NVIDIA remains a worthwhile buying opportunity.

It's worth noting that the US or Asia aren't the only ones committed to AI development - Europe is also active and not far behind. While Europe isn't often mentioned in these discussions (there's even a joke that the US owns AI while Europe has an ‘AI Act’ to regulate it), NVIDIA has highlighted its involvement in industrial/physical AI From the heart of Germany's automotive industry to the manufacturing hubs of France and Italy, Europe is adopting industrial AI and advanced AI robotics to address labour shortages, increase productivity and drive sustainable economic growth.

Robotics companies are developing humanoid robots and collaborative systems to integrate AI into real-world manufacturing applications. Backed by a $200bn investment programme and a coordinated effort by the European Commission, Europe is at the forefront of the next wave of AI-driven industrial automation.

It's easy to get caught up in concerns about potential overvaluation once the stock hits another record high. Take a look at NVDA's P/E ratio trend (I usually focus on EV/EBITDA, but it's showing the same trend). Since April 2025, the P/E has risen significantly as valuations have experienced a dynamic recovery (over 50%).

What's the key to deciding whether it's worth paying nearly $50 per share for $1 in earnings? It's the growth story behind NVIDIA and its continued path. NVIDIA's performance over the past few years suggests that it has a very good growth habit to reach its valuation levels. Just look at its P/E ratio in July 2023 - over 240x! Now, what surprises me is that buyers of NVIDIA actually made a lot of money during that time :)

How is that possible? NVIDIA's earnings are growing faster than its valuation. That's why you observe that valuation multiples have been declining since early 2024. Yes, the valuation multiple is now up nearly 50x, but ...... if NVIDIA continues on this path, delivers on its intended product roadmap, and the world continues to move towards an AI-driven economy, NVIDIA's current valuation will look cheap in a few years.

Risk factors? There are many, and there are no risk-free investments in the stock market. If the Trump administration escalates the trade war, which is currently on hold, NVIDIA could face some short-term issues that would impact NVIDIA's supply and customer operations. Yes, NVIDIA is well prepared for these changes, with some production being shifted to the U.S. and adjusted supply for Chinese customers (due to export restrictions). Any economic or geopolitical fluctuations could also hurt market sentiment, but in the long run I don't see this as a factor.

So, as an investor with a long-term focus and a bright future for NVIDIA, not only am I not selling any shares, I'm adding to my holdings. For me, NVIDIA remains a ‘Strong Buy’ stock. Cheers!
Bro is truly regarded May I ask what kind of a stock screening approach did you use to find LITERALLY THE MOST VALUABLE COMPANY in the world? The moment China enters, NVDA will have stiff competition. From a first principles point of view, stocks see-saw around their mean (mean reversion principle). 

The other fundamental part is supply of money chases a power law distribution of stocks. 

So yeah NVDA will go up in see-saw fashion as they show strong growth above their peers. 

But don’t expect a radical exponential growth.

Be bullish when market are bearish. Bearish when market is bullish. I mean, nvidia is 10000% the leaders, but you are a bit delusional. a competitor will eventually come along to take market share, remember tesla?  competition caught up,it's normal and it will happen to nvidia, it's still a great long term investment,but to say things had just begun is a bit delusional.

1lnefep,2025-06-29,"Nvidia Insiders Sold Over $1B in Stock  Should We Be Worried?
According to the Financial Times (via Reuters), Nvidia insiders have sold over $1 billion worth of stock over the past year  $500M just this month, right as NVDA hit all-time highs

Even Jensen Huang started selling this week for the first time since September  Meanwhile, NVDA is up 60%+ from its April lows, fueled by the AI boom and optimism around easing Trump-era tariffs

Yes, it's normal for insiders to take profits  but does the timing concern you? Are we nearing a short-term top, or is this just smart rebalancing while retail stays bullish?Personally, I'm still holding, but watching for signs of overextension
People sell at the top. When else will you cash out? Either you need the money for example to buy a house or you feel the price is too high and you want to reduce the risk

Selling 1 B for a multi trillion dollar company is a rounding error. 

Selling at bottom is for us here :) Insider sales don’t always mean trouble. Could be taxes, diversification, or just cashing out after massive gains

I’d be more worried if they were buying puts instead Seriously lol; it's one of the greatest stock runs in the history of mankind.  

If you don't take profits when you can, what's the whole point?  Bag holding just to give a bit more confidence to shareholders? NVDA used to be worth $100b then $300b then $500b then $1t then $1.5t then $2.5t and now nearing $4t.  What is the top?

MSFT is in their 50th year as a company - go look at their stock chart and tell me what is the top to sell at?  Back in their heydey as THE stock to own with stock splits coming every 8-15 months was way back in the 1990's.  Stock has increased 40-100x since then depending on when you got in.

EDIT: The return of MSFT would have been 40-500x from the 90's - my math wasn't mathing when I commented. Doesn't mean you need to sell it all. But if you had 200 shares and sold 1, or 2, or even 20, it is called derisking and diversification Y’all need to seriously stop reading so much into insider sales, it makes you look dumb Also, if you are gifted 40 million in stock and that becomes 100 million and then you cash out: you pay capital gain taxes instead of income tax which is a significant tax dodge for the super elite wealthy folks Most of them get paid in shares so insiders selling is normal also for nvidia they have to disclose that they are going to sell way before they actually sell Did you espect them to sell at the bottom ?

1lnc9j2,2025-06-29,"$RDDT Protecting Reddit’s data from AI.
In a sign that the company believes so deeply in the value of its data, Reddit sued Anthropic earlier this month, alleging that the AI startup “engaged in unlawful and unfair business acts” by scraping subreddits for information to improve its large language models.

While book authors have taken companies like Meta and Anthropic to court alleging that their AI models break copyright law and have suffered recent losses, Reddit is basing its lawsuit on the argument of unfair business practices. Reddit’s case appears to center on Anthropic’s “commercial exploitation of the data which they don’t own,” said Randy McCarthy, head of the IP law group at Hall Estill.

Reddit is defending its platform of user-generated content, said Jason Bloom, IP litigation chair at the law firm Haynes Boone. 

Also, Reddit isn’t just fending off AI. It’s launched its own Reddit Answers AI service in December. A company spokesperson said that over 1 million people are using Reddit Answers each week.
""their"" data?

You mean our data?

Reddit creates no content. *protecting THEIR AI from others' AI It is not ours, we create them, yes, but it is theirs, check the terms and conditions. If AI companies are allowed to freely use copyrighted books, which a judge ruled on as being fair use. I don't know how reddit could justify that using their data is any different.

https://decrypt.co/327137/meta-openai-copyrighted-books-ai-fair-use It's more complicated thatn just using copyrighed material. The authors here claimed that they were financially damaged while not presenting any evidence of that.
Reddit already has paid agreements with other companies to use it's data. So it can present evidence of income loss in this case. Hahahahahahaha

1ln9qul,2025-06-29,"What does the One Big Beautiful Bill mean for TSLA?
The bill could have a big impact on the company as EV tax credits of up to $7,5000 will be cut for new vehicles and $4,000 for used ones. It also eliminates fines for failing to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy rules - which would make it easier for car manufactures to build gas-powered vehicles

Will TSLA take a hit if it passes?
A hit to earnings or a hit to the stock price?

Those are two very different things for TSLA. As we all know, all TSLA traders are perfectly rational investors that only trade based on fundamentals. And the stock will still rocket for some inexplicable reasons. You think the oil industry is not subsidized? But of course. That's true. They are poor in so many other areas too. A subsidy for EVs is not a bad thing to force EV adoption. That's essentially what china did and their EV adoption rate is pretty much over 50%, and now they lead in worldwide EV industries as well as having much cleaner cities.  I think the way Elmo is reacting says it all. The stock on the other hand might be overinflated so that investors don’t run for the hills. Off course it will take a hit & that is why Musk & Trump get personal.

1ln0mny,2025-06-28,"Retatrutide: arguable the most effective metabolic drug ever developed. Full steam for LLY
Surprised how little attention Retatrutide is getting, even though it has the potential to be the most effective obesity and metabolic disease drug ever developed. 

Eli Lilly is leading the market with Mounjaro and Zepbound, but retatrutide, their next generation triple agonist targeting GLP 1, GIP, and glucagon receptors, could surpass both. I work in healthcare and people are switching from Novo's Wegovy and Ozempic to Zepbound/Mounjaro constantly. LLY has superiority. 

In Phase 2 trials, Reta led to weight loss of up to 24 percent in 48 weeks, approaching the results typically only seen with bariatric surgery. It also improved insulin sensitivity, lipid levels, liver fat, and other metabolic markers. This means it has potential not only for obesity and type 2 diabetes but also for conditions like nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, polycystic ovary syndrome, and cardiovascular risk reduction. 

Still in Phase 3 trials, with data expected in late 2025-2026. 
GLP 1 drugs are already being studied for sleep apnea, dementia, addiction, and osteoarthritis. Retatrutide could be the most powerful option for those indications as well.

I think if medicare eventually covers these in some capacity, yes it may bankrupt medicare but I have seen some studies show it will pay for itself in 3-5 years. 

Cannot wait for this data and its applications.
It’s an incredible drug, it’s nearly double better than zepbound arguably. There’s not a ton of longitudinal safety data yet and it hits a new receptor… but obesity is so bad for you that even if it has side effects it’s still probably better than obesity.

Problem is Eli Lily already is a 750b company. Everyone kind of expects this’ll work. I’m not sure how much action this will create. A lot of people are already on it since you can get the “research” peptides from the grey market.  It’s heavily used in the bodybuilding community to get super cut for shows. 

I don’t think it’s going to be a blockbuster for LLY since it will just replace tirzepatide, not sure if will bring in more people, everyone’s already on tirz. The body building community has a long history of taking risky stuff for the sake of the look. All so their bros can say:""damn dude, those are some nice triceps."" Yes and yes I want to see the next generation of studies that compare cellular aging and damage for people on metformin and retatrutide.   I’ve been loading up on Lilly.  The closer it gets to $700 the more i like it. It's a risky bet. Pharma trials can derail at any time due to side effects, and there are other companies developing GLP1 drugs. If it works as promised, LLY will make mountains of cash, if not, you might as well bury your investment in a hole for a decade. How lucky do you feel? I personally lost 60 pounds on mounjaro (270->210), it changed my enjoyment of life immensely. These meds are going to revolutionize healthcare over the next 20 years. Fuck, 50% of Americans should probably be taking them. The naysayers are full of shit and I will rebuke them all day, every day. Once these can be accessed at low cost the volumes will be massive. Imagine the worldwide potential Real world results tend to show Reta is marginally better than Tirz. It has a similar side effects profile to Tirz, but different enough that some folks tolerate one better than the other. Increased resting heart rate increases is a Reta side that jumps out a lot, which you don’t see with Tirz. Adding a dash of Cagri to your weekly Tirz routine basically gets you Reta like results.

1lmv9fj,2025-06-28,"Simple easy TQQQ strategy using the 200 SMA from QQQ with a few modifications
In my testing TQQQ is an absolute monster of an ETF that performs extremely well even from a buy and hold standpoint over long periods of time, its largest drawback is the massive drawdown exposure that it faces which can be easily sidestepped with this strategy.

This strategy is meant to basically abuse TQQQ's insane outperformance while augmenting the typical 200SMA strategy in a way that uses all of its strengths while avoiding getting whipsawed in sideways markets.

**The strategy BUYS TQQQ when QQQ price crosses 5% over the 200SMA and then SELLS TQQQ when QQQ price drops 3% below the 200SMA. Between trades I'll be parking my entire account in SGOV.**

So maximizing profit while minimizing risk.

You use the strategy based off of QQQ and then make the trades on TQQQ when it tells you to BUY/SELL.

Here are some reasons why I will be using this strategy:

* Simple emotionless BUY and SELL signals where I don't care who the president is, what is happening in the world, who is bombing who, who the leadership team is, no attachment to individual companies and diversified across the NASDAQ.
* \~85% win percentage and when it does lose the loses are nothing compared to the wins and after a loss you're basically set up for a massive win in the next trade.
* Max drawdown of around 40% when using TQQQ
* You benefit massively when the market is doing well and when there is a recession you basically sit in SGOV for a year and then are set up for a monster recovery with a clear easy BUY signal. So as long as you're patient you win regardless of what happens.
* The trades are often very long term resulting in you taking advantage of Long Term Capital Gains tax advantage which could mean saving up to 15-20% in taxes.
* With only a few trades you can spend time doing other stuff and don't have to track or pay attention to anything that is happening.
* Simple, easy, and massively profitable.

1lmjn24,2025-06-28,"Trump Ends Trade Talks with Canada  Tariffs Incoming? What This Means for Big Tech Stocks
Just saw that Trump officially ended all trade talks with Canada over their digital services tax. He posted that new tariffs are coming “within the next seven days,” and Treasury says they’re prepping a Section 301 investigation  same tool they used on China a few years back

The DST is a 3% tax on digital revenue from Canadian users once a company crosses C$20 million in a year. So naturally this hits companies like Meta, Google, Amazon  and even smaller players like Uber and Etsy. Amazon’s already put out a statement saying they’re disappointed and that this will hurt Canadian consumers, which is probably true because these companies won’t just eat the cost  it’ll get passed on one way or another

Markets didn’t totally freak out, but the Canadian dollar dropped briefly, and the TSX closed slightly down. Cross-border names like GM and Canada Goose took small hits, which makes sense  they’re very trade-sensitive. I imagine this will also hit Canadian ad buyers and retailers pretty directly if tech platforms raise prices in response

Personally I’m wondering how much this really moves the needle for the big tech names. Like sure, $2B in added tax burden sounds big, but spread across giants like AMZN and META, maybe it’s just noise. But if this escalates if tariffs are actually announced next week  then it becomes a bigger deal. Especially with that July 9 deadline coming up for other countries too. Could see short-term volatility spike, especially in sentiment-drive
Not tariffs again… here we go Most of Europe already charges a digital services tax and most of the rest of the world is in the process of implementing one. I believe some Latin American countries already do as well.

It's an easy concept. Collecting revenue in a country typically results in being taxed. Short lived dip on Monday followed by the usual pump programming. 

Can't have red stocks during America's birthday Tariffs never left, population is paying for them for a few months already. I don't think Canada will fold on it and I don't even really think it's what has made Trump mad.. more likely it's the strategic defence partnership Canada just signed with the EU. Either way it will have practically no impact on US tech. Free trade doesn't mean products aren't taxed, it means no tariffs or duties. 

There's a difference although in the land of mango Mussolini there appears to be much confusion, lol What this means? Absolutely nothing, TACO will prevail. This has nothing to do with the DST so much as it is about Canada implementing policies in conjunction with Europe, who also have a DST. Toss in the fact Europe has been fining the big tech companies and, those companies, are probably getting a bit concerned that outside of the US, governments aren't simply dropping their pants and bending over for them. They are unable to buy country leaders the way they can in the US. 

Like most things, the DST is just a minor issue they can fight over which is symbolic of a much bigger issue. The biggest companies in the world don't want their profits taxed, big shocker. Or it could be the $2.7M in same day expiration put options that were bought just before Trump’s tweet.

What is everyone's thoughts on Google and the Open AI news ? Is this the news that will turn Google's year into something worthwhile or will it pull back and continue to trade sideways ? One analyst says they believe it can see $ 250. Does anyone agree with that ? I had much higher expectations for them after the dip , however it seems like it has taken forever for them do anything worthwhile.
200 soon. 250 if we lucky by eoy Google is 100% the play. First of all in all relevant regards its **better** than ChatGPT. It also **owns** the necessary data to continue to grow and improve the platform and it also has the reach to dominate the space. Did you start investing 6 months ago?

Googl has been an awesome stock forever, and is taking a short vacation currently It just shows how much better vision Google has compared to their competitors.

They started the TPUs over 12 years ago and now on the seventh generation.

Only now is Microsoft going to try to copy Google. Gemini.com is a crypto platform owned by the billionaire Winklevoss twins, the same twins that got fleeced by Mark Zuckerberg for their idea of Facebook.

This is a massive oversight from Google and the crypto platform is heavily benefiting from it. These guys are already billionaires so I already know the amount they want is astronomical. Google has to judge whether Gemini is worth keeping or rebrand (once again) #ive been invested in googl and the rest of U.S big tech since 2016, I especially liked when googl doubled during the covid period, it had the highest return of the 5 for a long while,

https://www.crn.com/news/ai/2025/google-cloud-s-openai-deal-a-win-for-tpu-chips-microsoft-partner-says

Make no mistake, this is also a win for Google Cloud against Microsoft Azure,” says one Microsoft partner top executive. ‘[OpenAI] has continued, all year long, to loosen its dependency on Microsoft.

“Hats off to Google. They made the right R&D moves to win over a customer with lots of money to spend,” said the executive.

Google has its own DeepMind AI lab that competes directly against OpenAI around developing large language models (LLMs) for AI customers.

“[OpenAI] will be spending a ton of money on Google. They have $10 billion in sales. There’s money to be made here by Google,” the solution provider executive said. “We’re a big Azure shop, but I can see Google making some headwinds with its chips and cloud business overall because of the money they’re going to make on OpenAI. ... But we’re still big believers that Microsoft will be the leader in the AI era.”

I’m a huge Google bull. I see AI as a naturally oligopolistic industry. Multiple winners are possible. Google will lose in some areas, but win in others. 

However, you need the full stack. Google has the full stack. The Hardware, The Software, The Data, The Network, The Capital, and The Employees. No one else has it all. And it’s working. 

https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-convinces-openai-use-tpu-chips-win-nvidia

If Google fails at AI, that would be a tale for the ages about innovator’s dilemma. They have everything they need to win. I’m of the belief that Google Execs see the challenge.

>  Google has the full stack. The Hardware, The Software, The Data, The Network, The Capital, and The Employees. No one else has it all. And it’s working. 

But I thought Google was just a search company? I want people to continue to see it as a legacy boring dying Search company, until Q3 earnings ;) This post mostly was sparked by the OpenAI & Google TPU deal that The Information just leaked. 

I’m personally shocked. But I also think Google made that a requirement of the deal. Google is spreading their bets. If Search fails, GCP is going to boom. Boring search company that coincidentally had the highest income of any public company in the world pver the trailing 12 months Google has good presence in Ai cuz the money are not from individual subscriptions but software for Corps. Google already implemented models linked to internal documents in many organizations.


So if you're on office and SharePoint you'll get msft package, if you're on gdocs you'll get Google ai

Both will be enough and it will be war on price. Whoever is more cost effective Google bears are going to be so mad. I’ve been trying to talk some sense into them for weeks The thing is, search can’t really “fail” in the sense that it won’t be profitable. It could stagnant or decline over time, but some iteration of a Google product conducting searches of information and receiving money from entities that benefit from their information being found will be around for decades.

1llz7l5,2025-06-27,"Trump Announces Mineral Rights Deal With Congo What does this mean for the stock market?
Just saw the big news: Trump brokered a mineral deal between the U.S. and the DRC that will give U.S. firms access to key minerals such as cobalt, tantalum, lithium, and copper in exchange for U.S. support for the Congo-Rwanda peace deal 

This looks like more than just geopolitical maneuvering, it could have long-term implications for the stock market and certain stocks.

Brief summary

The U.S., pushed by Trump, brokered a peace deal between Congo and Rwanda and signed a multi-billion dollar “minerals for security” agreement.

Trump's allies and private companies (including Massad Boulos) plan to invest over $500 million to build a smelter there, with the goal of moving away from dependence on the Chinese mineral chain.

Why this deserves investor attention

KEY MINERALS, STRATEGIC MATERIALS 

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) controls roughly 70 percent of the world's cobalt and 60 percent of its tantalum reserves-metals widely used in electric car batteries, chips, electronics, and military technology.

If the U.S. can establish its own supply chain, the global industrial landscape could be rewritten.

Capital Flows Could Change 

If U.S. miners and tech companies get in first, companies like Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), Albemarle (ALB), or lithium material companies like Livent (LTHM) could be the winners.

 Geo Risks vs Market Opportunities 

The Congo situation remains complex - if a peace deal stands, commodity prices could stabilize and U.S. firms may be able to gain control of resources in the long term; conversely, a short-term landmine.

Impact on Tech & EV Sectors 

OEMs such as Tesla and the battery chain (e.g., NVDA, TSLA, BATT-type ETFs) could benefit if cobalt and lithium supplies become more stable and EV production costs fall.

CURRENT MARKET REACTION: 

Global mining stocks rallied in the early stages of the peace deal rumors, but then retreated as details of the deal remain unclear

Market Sentiment: cautiously optimistic and bullish in the long term, but short-term uncertainties remain (situation, implementation, opposition factions, etc.)

My recommendations from an investment perspective

Long-term Layout Focus on resource stocks (e.g. ALB, FCX) - once the agreement is implemented, it is a probable event for US companies to acquire substantial mineral resources.

Medium-term ideas Tracking battery, electric vehicle sector - if the cost of raw materials downward, vehicle margins and growth logic benefit.

Short-term operation Pay attention to the progress of events - the peace agreement is unstable and may be repeated; if you intervene, you can add a stop loss or hedge.

Macro observation If the United States to “resource diplomacy” as a means of follow-up in Greenland, Ukraine and other places may also have similar operations.

Some of my questions

Has anyone been following cobalt or lithium resource stocks? Any early layouts for this wave?

Do you think this peace deal is sustainable, or is it just a “paper peace”?

Bigger question: does this mean that China is loosening its grip on key minerals?
The cobalt market is massively oversupplied, to the point that Congo voluntarily halted all exports earlier this year to try to build some sort of floor under the collapsing price. They extended this halt another three months just last week. Even with Congo's production held back the price hasn't gone through the roof, and they haven't stopped mining so the market will flood again when they give up. Risks over future supply due to issues in the region have always made people a bit reluctant to build things that rely on it. The tin market got hit recently with rebels and warlords disrupting the big producer there.

Lithium is a waste product found on oil fields, the US has loads of the stuff domestically. Another massively oversupplied market after companies rushed in after the big processing-related price spike a few years ago.

To my knowledge none of this stuff was out of reach to US comapnies previously, only Congo's copper had a few hurdles with the country requiring refining happen in-country rather than shipping concentrate to China or elsewhere. You mean Erik Prince announced? No, this blackwater resource extraction and 'protection' scheme is dead in the water. It doesn't deal with the actual problem of the poorly drawn borders and weak governments, it just takes more advantage of it. Yeah f preventing aids in africa, but the minerals from there... ooo wee! That dude is straight evil Not sure, I think most African graphite is found on the East coast in the Madagasgar/Mozambique/Malawi area. It's highly specialised and only certain deposits are useful for particlar applications due to flake sizes, so even if you have a source it might not be what you need for a specific battery use. Very complex market.

I own shares in Sovereign Metals which is a titanium oxides/graphite development project in Malawi, likely to be bought out by mining giant Rio Tinto in the next few years. its not that China has a grip on the minerals they have a grip on the refining or processing of the minerals.  So finding them is fine, its turning the raw product into a useable product is still going to be in bulk in China, which will allow them to halt exports if they choose. Mining in DRC? HA! Good luck with that. This is the stocks subreddit. Do you know a pharma stock about to pump? What are you doing here? Finally a decent post Cobalt yes.

1llysj9,2025-06-27,"Shorting Starbucks seems like free money right now - here is my DD.
Starbucks has seen their revenues shrink over their last 5 quarters consecutively, while the EPS have sunk at an even faster rate during this time. Everything I've seen suggests this trend will accelerate. 

A quick look at the balance sheet shows that the company is insolvent. Starbucks is heavily indebted and will have to borrow more as it's not even close to covering its current liabilities, and the book value is negative.

Retained earnings have been negative the last 6 years, while the dividend payout ratio has exceeded 85% and growing. Its stores in China (where they've grossly overextended their footprint) are getting killed by Luckin, and sales have been down in US as well. This is a consumer discretionary which suffers greatly in downturns (oops consumer sentiment is at 40 year lows now). And cheaper coffee alternatives are not hard to find.

The explosion of weight loss drug use doesn't bode well for Starbucks's sugary cold drinks which are the lion's share of its profits, as these medications tend to curtail cravings for sugar.

Then you also have historically high coffee prices (spiking demand in emerging markets, tariffs don't help), declining brand sentiment and consumer reviews, and a company searching for an identity under its new leadership (do they want automation? do they want their stores to be hang-out shops?) in an industry with virtually no barriers to entry. Anywhere there is a Starbucks there are numerous local mom and pop coffee shops which customers increasingly are choosing over corporate chains, and consistently have much higher reviews.



All these and this company still has the audacity to trade at a P/E double that of Google's (yeah, yeah, not an apt comparison, sue me.. it's still absurd to me).

  
Disclaimer: I am short SBUX via the common shares.
Shorting anything is never free money. It's a gamble I hope you win. Very reasonable and sound argument, which means you can expect the exact opposite. This market don’t run on reason. Never bet against white girl stocks; people learned this the hard way during the pandemic. 

They can restructure their capital structure, sell off assets or subsidiaries, reduce costs, etc. There's a ton of options on the table for them. 

Even if your thesis is all correct, I don't think your shorts will survive long enough to profit during a record stock market.  And I don't think your assumptions are correct at all.  The Company certainly has its challenges but is far from ""insolvent"". My wife spends way too much money there. Bullish.

Have you even tried their pinkidy drinkidy? Bullish. For sure, seems like an obvious choice to me but a definite hyperbole objectively. Goes without saying, I hope nobody gambles any of their own money on my dumbass analysis. i'm not one to short but i looked at the financials after previous earnings report and decided to sell my entire SBUX position and dump it into MSFT, turned out to be a good idea so far Agreed, this market is not rational. SBUX is up 16% over the past year despite falling everything and really nothing to get excited about. This is definitely an entertaining post for sure. Is their balance sheet upside down? Yes. Are they insolvent? Absolutely not 

Most of their debt has a lower rate than the prime, let alone prime + 1/2 which is the going rate for BBB+

4b matures in 5-10 yrs with a rate of 4%

Another 4b matures in 15-25 years, again with a rate of 4% 

Their FCF can easily pay off their LT debt in 3 years but why would they when the prime rate exceeds their debt rate?

1llxad6,2025-06-27,"Google will lose ad revenue if they lose $20 billion deal with Apple.
Google is not paying Apple over $20B just to be the default search on Safari. 

Google is paying a percentage of their ad revenue generated on Apple devices. 

This includes iPads, iPhones and Macs. It also includes ad revenue generated from their own Chrome browser on Apple devices. Over 50% of Google ad revenue comes from Apple devices.With iOS (including iPadOS), anywhere from 30% to 45% of users (depending on who's counting) uses Google Chrome browser. Anywhere from 30% to over 50% of Mac users (also depending on who's counting) use Google Chrome browser. 

This doesn't mean use exclusively, as most will use more than one browser when surfing the net. I use Safari, Chrome and Firefox on my Macs. With Chrome and Firefox getting the most usage on my older Macs and Safari being the most used on my newer macs. 

With Google Chrome browser, Apple do not get to decide the default search engine. And yet, Google is still paying Apple a percentage of the ad revenue generated from their own Chrome browser on Apple devices.  
I have not read anywhere whether Google is paying Apple the same 36% of ad revenue generated on their Chrome browser, less than or however unlikely, more than. But that part of the more than $20B that Google pays Apple, is not tied to being made the default on Safari. 
Dude google could end world hunger, and cure cancer and the algo would still have google drop 10% Have you used Gemini lately

Many metrics place it as the best model

I personally use Gemini over ChatGPT these days and have pro subscriptions to both

Admittedly Gemini flash is pretty bad but Gemini pro 2.5 beats o3 or anything else hands down and the huge context window is crazy useful I disagree. I think people will just end up manually switching to Google as their default search engine. Much like how people go out their way to download Chrome and set it as their default browser on Windows.

I also can’t imagine Apple defaulting to any search engine other than Google. They might default to ChatGPT or develop their own search engine if the rumoured acquisition of Perplexity becomes true. You still have time to delete.. Ending world hunger and curing cancer are not profitable ventures. Duh Gemini is way better than  chatgpt the fuck are u talking about Honestly don’t see how gpt is any better than Gemini at this point Not sure with you guys, but I already was prompted to chose, and you know what, I am pretty happy with using Google

Recent U.S. Stock Review and Outlook Let's discuss

According to [Investing.com](http://Investing.com), about 90% of stocks are up this month, and many organizations give the “best performance of the year” comments

The S&P 500 is up about 3.9%, and M + M + 1 ≈ 4.4%, while the Nasdaq is up 5.5%, which is a particularly strong performance.

S&P and Nasdaq have approached all-time highs as Mideast tensions ease, inflation data retreats, and the market sides with tech and consumer stocks

Leading stocks lead reshaping of the landscape

NVIDIA Lair AI boom leads tech sector: market cap tops $3.7 trillion in an absurdly fashion leading to related chip & AI concepts

Palantir Coinbase, Micron Super Micro and other stocks rose vigorously, Nasdaq contribution

Background variables to pay attention to

While some stocks have surged (e.g., Cyngn up 483%) the overall market remains cautious: economic and geopolitical uncertainties remain so watch for pullbacks

Cboe VIX surged to \~20 level indicating that the market is wary of potential turbulence

U.S. bond yields slipped as markets quickly focused on expectations for a September rate cut

A look at the second half of the year

Broad-based indices structurally higher with increased capital concentration

Technical statistics show that consecutive June gains have corresponded to historical return paths with high probability of continued gains over the next six months and full year (+8.8%, +14.8%)

Tech AI sectors continue to dominate

NVIDIA and its ecosystem benefit from AI proliferation other tech giants such as MSFT and IBM are also at record highs

However market breadth is still narrow so we recommend focusing on the obvious strong leaders and their followers

Macro factors are still potentially disruptive

Geo risks such as Middle East conflict US tariff warning fiscal cliff could still trigger pullbacks

Technology stocks may adjust if the Fed fails to cut rates in July/September as expected or if the economy weakens

Capital Rotation & Individual Stock Opportunities

There are still opportunities outside of AI: as shown by the market's stock picking system most stock picks have outperformed by more than 90% in June and there is room for arbitrage between sectors

In addition, some of the “non-hot” stocks outperformed, providing a possibility for strategic diversification

Summary of my investment recommendations

Medium to long term Allocate to AI/technology leaders such as NVDA/MSFT, and consider a diversified sector balance (consumer, industrials, defense)

Short-term opportunities Take advantage of pullbacks to participate in cyclicals energy and AI outgrowths pay attention to stock picking system alerts and control your position

Risk control Remain flexible and set stops on take-profit and stop-losses if the impact of economic/geopolitical events is felt adjust your position and avoid the overvalued sectors for the time being

For example if I’m looking for video results, I’m just searching for it on YouTube directly. 

If I’m looking for text-based results, however, I’m using Google search to find results on Reddit because Reddit search sucks.  Because people don't go on Google Search engine to find IG or youtube  content. They are directly in the apps to either organically scroll and click on suggested posts or suggested friends (i.e. IG) or they use the built in search channel of the app (i.e. YouTube). That's why it's low relative to its user base numbers

  
Reddit is high because EVERYONE who uses reddit (or not) finds Reddit content by searching on google and adding the Reddit suffix. No one actually uses the app itself to search for content. 100% Instagram and YouTube seem really low. Instagram most specifically since it has over a billion users and I’m sure that some search more than once a month. 

Is this for Searches on all Search Engines? 

What is the source? I prefer Gemini.  I found the ""Reddit Answers"" to be a big improvement when searching Reddit posts like ""How scary is the RE2 remake?""

1llu93e,2025-06-27,"Trump: US-China Trade Framework ""Signed""  Rare Earths Deal, Tariffs Rollback in Motion
Trump just said that the U.S. and China “signed” a framework deal on tariffs and trade. This follows the informal understanding they reached in Geneva back in May

Key points:

China confirmed both sides have finalized details of the framework

China will resume rare earth exports to the U.S

In return, the U.S. will remove countermeasures (probably the steep retaliatory tariffs).

Commerce Secretary Lutnick says 10 more trade deals are close mentions Canada, Japan, etc

Treasury Sec. Bessent says they want to wrap up trade talks by Labor Day (Sept 1)

The July 9 tariff deadline might get pushed back if talks show “good faith.”

Trump already sealed a deal with the UK; the EU is next, but tensions are high (threats of 50% tariffs on EU goods )

Stephen Miran (White House economic adviser) also said we may not see tariffs go below 10% long-term, but some countries could get better rates depending on how talks go

My take: This could be bullish for sectors exposed to China or dependent on rare earths (think EVs, semis, clean energy). If tariffs ease, expect to see some relief rallies across the board

Tickers to watch:$TSLA (EVs & rare earths)$NVDA / $AMD (semi exposure)$BABA / $JD / $NIO (China plays)$XLI / $IYT (industrials, transports)
So things go back to the status quo and it’s called a win? Nobel peace prize worthy, no? Wasn't the whole point of this to bring back production to the US? How are 20% Tarifs, or a 20% surcharge on top of Chinese products supposed to shift production? You'd need like 100% to even start thinking about shifting production? 😅 It's basically just a extra tax on people because it won't change things fundamentally 😂 Isn’t this slightly worse than the pre-Trump status quo though? Art of the deal It's what in the small print that matters. No.  Over the past 3 months manufacturing has come back to America.  Look out your window - don’t you see all the new factories that have been built?  The new manufacturing economy is surging! This market is gonna whipsaw off every trade headline till September, I’m just trading VIX at this point If de minimis never gets re instated (it’s not a specific country so won’t be a part of any trade deal) then it’s a still a huge hit for consumers and a big win for giant retailers


Nothing was ever tariff or tax free **except** de minimis The whole thing was stupid from day one. Even if you want to use tariffs you pit other countries against each other, you don't unify them all against you at the same time. Most likely the real intent was for Trump to solicit backdoor crypto bribes from these countries; give him a couple billion and he drops the tariffs (or indefinitely delays them).",235,0.89,146,0,za1daman,stocks,"['TSLA', 'NVDA']",trump uschina trade framework signed rare earths deal tariffs rollback motion trump said us china signed framework deal tariffs trade follows informal understanding reached geneva back may key points china confirmed sides finalized details framework china resume rare earth exports us return us remove countermeasures probably steep retaliatory tariffs commerce secretary lutnick says 10 trade deals close mentions canada japan etc treasury sec bessent says want wrap trade talks labor day sept 1 july 9 tariff deadline might get pushed back talks show good faith trump already sealed deal uk eu next tensions high threats 50 tariffs eu goods stephen miran white house economic adviser also said may see tariffs go 10 longterm countries could get better rates depending talks go take could bullish sectors exposed china dependent rare earths think evs semis clean energy tariffs ease expect see relief rallies across board tickers watchtsla evs rare earthsnvda amd semi exposurebaba jd nio china playsxli iyt industrials transports things go back status quo called win nobel peace prize worthy wasnt whole point bring back production us 20 tarifs 20 surcharge top chinese products supposed shift production youd need like 100 even start thinking shifting production basically extra tax people wont change things fundamentally isnt slightly worse pretrump status quo though art deal small print matters past 3 months manufacturing come back america look window dont see new factories built new manufacturing economy surging market gonna whipsaw every trade headline till september im trading vix point de minimis never gets instated specific country wont part trade deal still huge hit consumers big win giant retailers nothing ever tariff tax free except de minimis whole thing stupid day one even want use tariffs pit countries dont unify time likely real intent trump solicit backdoor crypto bribes countries give couple billion drops tariffs indefinitely delays

News: [China Us Agree Details Of London Trade Framework Trade Agreement Beijing](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/27/china-us-agree-details-of-london-trade-framework-trade-agreement-beijing.html)

[**NKE (Nike)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NKE&p=d)\-Reported EPS of $0.14 vs. $0.13 expected; revenue of $11.1B vs. $10.72B expected. Despite the miss on earnings, the NKE CEO expressed cautious optimism, stating that while improvements are expected, a full recovery remains distant (mainly due to tariffs which he said would have a $1B impact). Also forecasted \~5% Q1 sales decline, a better outlook than the 7% drop forecasted. Interested in seeing if this breaks $70 today. Sportswear and LULU have been inconsistent in recovery from tariffs, interested to see if LULU moves (and has potentially recovery) from this.

[**OKLO (Oklo Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OKLO&p=d)\- Reportedly, the Trump administration is preparing executive actions to enhance energy infra and AI. The administration will release an ""AI Action Plan"" on July 23. These measures aim to address grid congestion, permitting delays, by declaring a national energy emergency. I'm seeing OKLO move off this but I'm interested other nuclear energy stocks as well. OKLO failed to break $60 in premarket but interested in watching further.

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\-NVDA hit an all-time high along with the market, as the U.S. and China agreed on a trade framework and Iran/Israel tensions de-escalated. Momentum has continued as macro fears (mainly from Israel/Iran) die down and AI infrastructure investment remains elevated (CRWV acquiring CORZ). Interested in seeing if NVDA can hold above prior day's low ($153.49), momentum is pretty sustained and the move can continue far longer than anyone can expect. Since the trade framework with China was agreed upon, the next catalyst I'm potentially interested in is lifting of chip restrictions in China. 

[**PONY (Pony AI)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PONY&p=d)/UBER- UBER is reportedly in talks to support Travis Kalanick’s acquisition of the US arm of Pony AI. A successful deal would reintroduce Kalanick to the self-driving space, and potentially integrate autonomous capabilities within Uber’s broader platform strategy. News happened yesterday, and we don't typically see further movement but I'm interested if there's a competing bid. LYFT/TSLA didn't move off this so not too interested.

1lltc8s,2025-06-27,"Uber in Talks With Its Founder, Travis Kalanick, to Fund Self-Driving Car Deal
>Uber is increasingly grappling with competition from self-driving taxi services like Waymo. Now the ride-hailing giant is taking more action to deal with that threat.

>Uber is in talks with Travis Kalanick, the company’s co-founder who was forced out in a boardroom coup eight years ago this month, to help fund his acquisition of the U.S. subsidiary of a Chinese autonomous vehicle company, two people with knowledge of the matter said. The company, Pony.ai, was founded in Silicon Valley in 2016 but has its main presence in China, and has permits to operate robot taxis and trucks in the United States and China.

>The talks are preliminary, said the people, who were not authorized to speak about the confidential conversations. Mr. Kalanick will run Pony if the deal is completed, they said. It is unclear what role, if any, Uber would take in Pony as an investor.

>Financial details of the potential transaction could not be determined. Pony went public last year in the United States, raising $260 million in a share sale. Its market capitalization stands around $4.5 billion.

>If the deal goes through, Mr. Kalanick, 48, will remain in his day job running CloudKitchens, a virtual restaurant start-up that he founded after leaving Uber in 2017. He would also work more closely with Dara Khosrowshahi, who took over as Uber’s chief executive after Mr. Kalanick’s ouster.

>The discussions are the starkest sign yet that Uber is under pressure from Waymo, the driverless car unit spun out of Google, and other autonomous car services. This month, Tesla also unveiled a limited robot taxi service in Austin, Texas. Over time, these autonomous vehicle services may replace or eat into rides from human drivers. In cities like San Francisco, where robot taxi services are available, the vehicles have become ubiquitous and are popular.

>An Uber spokesman declined to comment on deal talks and said, “Uber has a platform strategy, and we intend to work with multiple players in the U.S. and around the world who can safely bring autonomous technology to the world.”

>Devon Spurgeon, a spokeswoman for Mr. Kalanick, did not immediately have a comment. Pony did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

>When Mr. Kalanick was Uber’s chief executive, the company tried developing autonomous vehicle technology. It then bought Otto, a self-driving trucking start-up run by Anthony Levandowski, a former Google engineer. Google later sued Mr. Levandowski for theft of trade secrets and sued Uber to bar it from using its self-driving technology.

>Under Mr. Khosrowshahi, Uber has taken a different tack to self-driving cars. The company has struck roughly 18 partnerships with autonomous vehicle companies like Wayve, May Mobility and WeRide to bring pilot programs for driverless car services into Europe, the Middle East and Asia.

>The goal, Mr. Khosrowshahi has said in podcast interviews, has been to put “as many cars on Uber’s network as possible.” He has maintained that while autonomous vehicles are growing steadily, ride-hailing networks will have both human and robot drivers for years.

>Today, Uber both competes and collaborates with Waymo. In Phoenix, riders can order a Waymo car through Uber’s app. In Austin, Waymo’s robot taxis don the Uber logo. But Waymo has also expanded into more cities, potentially biting into Uber’s business. And in San Francisco, Waymo customers are required to use the Waymo app to order rides.

>Uber is also watching Elon Musk, who has promised a wider rollout of Tesla’s self-driving taxis and has declined to team up with Uber.

>Mr. Kalanick has grown interested in robotics over the past year, according to two people who have spoken with him. He has brought robots into some of his CloudKitchens to prepare food for customers and has experimented with automated kitchens building food bowls for delivery. He has also become enamored with robots that traverse streets to deliver food to people.

>Pony.ai has been in a precarious situation. In 2019, President Trump’s first administration passed an executive order aimed at eliminating reliance on Chinese technologies in American services, citing national security concerns.

>This year, the Commerce Department passed a rule that forbids autonomous vehicle software used in the United States to be operated or maintained by any Chinese entity. The department set a deadline for March 2026.

>Pony has prepared its U.S. subsidiary of the business for a sale or spinoff. Its engineers “forked” the source code of its technology in 2022, and the software running on autonomous cars has for the past few years been developed in the United States and not in China, two people familiar with the matter said.

>Apart from Uber, Mr. Kalanick is working with other investors to finance a possible transaction of Pony.

>Mr. Kalanick’s early years at Uber were marked by clashes with regulators and other Silicon Valley executives, led by his pugnacious streak. Despite his reputation - or perhaps because of it - Mr. Kalanick brute-forced Uber into a dominant position in the ride-hailing market and toppled traditional taxi services in the process.

>Since his acrimonious exit from Uber in 2017, Mr. Kalanick has kept a low profile, working on CloudKitchens and quietly investing in other start-ups. Only more recently has he begun reappearing in the public eye, making a guest appearance at the “All-In” podcast’s conference event in Los Angeles last September and at Mr. Trump’s inauguration parties in Washington in January.

>Over the past year, Mr. Kalanick and Mr. Khosrowshahi began speaking more frequently, two people said. They discussed robotics, food delivery and the growth of Uber Eats and CloudKitchens, along with the rise of self-driving cars. Those talks, along with the passage of time, have led to a thawing of the once icy relationship between the two men, the people said.

Yeah that's a weird way to describe a delivery-only kitchen. If the deal goes through, Mr. Kalanick, 48, will remain in his day job running CloudKitchens, a virtual restaurant start-up that he founded after leaving Uber in 2017.

1llsk8n,2025-06-27,"An A1 question
$MSFT, $AMZN, $CRM, $GOOG and a bunch of other companies are slashing jobs left and right -- because of AI (they've named the scourge in their statements). 

Right now, it's good for stockholders, because lower margins (ie people) mean a more streamlined company, which means potentially a growth in the company's value. 

But for me, the long-term growth in AI (apart from an utterly depressed world) will mean - long-term - that stocks will hurt because people won't have jobs to go to, won't be able to earn any money, and therefore won't be able to pay into pension funds. Pension funds in turn will lessen in influx of capital, so they have less to invest. The circle gets worse and worse. 

I've heard many-a-person tell me: ""Remember the internet? Remember how many people said jobs would be lost because of that, and how they came back?"", but my biggest question is this: What will the job landscape look like around the world if AI is killing everything around it? 

Do we expect college-aged kids to go and work in the cornfields and do cleaning jobs because they can't find work after leaving college. More's the case, we're also going to see unpaid student debt rise beyond all measure....and the death of many-a-college.

The other side of it is that there will be a limit to how much can be cut, and unions stop AI killing every job in the world, leading to a more socialist world but one that sees more people employed. 

Or am I missing something?
I hope we will utilize AI to enhance our work abilities rather than completely be replaced. I hope that I will be able to sleep with a supermodel, but that's not going to happen either. AI is just the hit tend at the moment. 10 years ago you couldn’t go 5 minutes without hearing the word “blockchain” and every company using that in their marketing. Look what happened to that. The next thing now is “stablecoin” which a lot of finance stocks will be putting that buzzword in. 

Everyone is placing their bets in the market on what parts of AI will be successful and which won’t. Only time will tell what happens, but most of these AI companies won’t survive. Some have already backtracked a bit that AI isn’t quite able to replace a person. But like you said, these companies depend on their bottom line and they’ll do what they have to.

That’s the stock market for you. The world is constantly changing. You have companies interested in US manufacturing with the current administration, and you have space stocks getting popular has more competition enters the space as satellite and defense technology improves. It’s up to you to decide where you want to put your money.  I did laugh when everyone started going on about ""stablecoin"" and everyone said THIS IS A DISASTER FOR $V and $MA and shares fell 4% in a day....

And then Visa and Mastercard said: ""We've been working on this stablecoin for years. We'll be fine"". 

And then.......silence. I see the picture you're painting but your dotted line feels like equating a hot day to a 10 year drought. Some if not almost all of those people will find other jobs, presumably some of those jobs will have pension plans. Thinking about this as well.

I do think AMZN MFST etc are pretty safe. Especially AMZN.

I’m just saying that as someone who buys mostly all his necessities from there. Like stuff I can’t be without. OK, so where??? This is the problem with AI.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1llosu8,2025-06-27,"Capital gains tax for options, short term VS long term?
I have recently been catching flak for day trading and scalping options on SPY. People have rightly argued that I would lose less in taxes if I went with SPX instead of SPY. While I know long term, if I am going to trade large sums that is the way to go, I am not sure on the actual cost it is causing me at the moment. I have read on several different sites that the main difference is that all of SPY scalps will be counted as short term whereas 60% would count as long term on SPX regardless of how long I help. This would result in 60% being taxed at a lower rate. 

The trouble is, I am not able to pin down exact or even close to exact numbers on what the difference is. Some of the sites say wildly different ranges. One states a tax rate of anywhere between 20-50% even. So I am asking you guys who have actually dealt with it. If I earn 100k at my job and then earn an additional 150k on day trades, around what rate would those trades be taxed at if they were on SPY vs if they were on SPX? I know this goal is probably lofty. But it does give me a best (worst) case scenario to work from. 
You can't find any actual numbers because it depends entirely on your *actual* income. Articles can only give you percentages, that come from tax brackets, because that's how taxes work. 

If the entire $150k were all short term, your total ordinary income would be $250k. I'll use round numbers to make it simpler. The amount from $100k to $200k covers the entire 24% bracket, so you owe $24k in taxes. The amount from $200 to $250k is in the 32% bracket, so you owe $16k in taxes. Total of $40k in taxes on the $150k, or effective 26.6%.

If you go with SPX:

40% of $150k is $60k. Which is added to your $100k ordinary income. That $60k is in the 24% bracket. So you owe $14.4k

60% of $150k is $90k. Taxed at long term rate which your income falls in the 15% bracket, is $13.5k

Total taxes on the $150k is $27.9k, or effective 18.6%.

Obviously this is using your round $100k as AGI, ignoring deductions and whatnot. Perfect. This is exactly what I was looking for. So it is a pretty significant cost savings.... Do you think 100k/year is rich or something? FYI you will get a lot of this because your question does not have a straight forward answer and is highly dependent on your particular circumstances. The short version is the 60/40 rule applies to the SPX but not the SPY so depending on your tax bracket your answer will change. So before the year is over the best we can say is you will very likely pay less tax with SPX. Also your account type matters, for example if you are doing this in your 401k or HSA account that’s different than a regular brokerage account. Lol that dude is an idiot. An 8% difference in taxes is absolutely significant No, thinking you can make 1.5x  your salary in day trading is just crazy lol, ok Who cares bro if you’re paying taxes that means you’re making money. Just make sure to sell off any stocks you’re holding that you’re down on to write off the loss from the gains Seriously? If the difference is between 20% and 50%, I care a lot. And if you trade a lot you should too lol. If I make 150k profits, that is the difference between paying 30k or 75k. Obviously this is probably exaggerated as I don't know the actual numbers. But keeping more of your profit is a good thing.

Also, why respond to a post asking a question unless you actually have an answer to that question. Responding with ""who cares"" is kind of dumb in this scenario. I wouldn’t worry about it.

NVDA hit a record high ($154.31), regaining the top market cap at $3.76T, ahead of MSFT. Since April, NVDA has surged 63%.

Analysts at Melius and Bernstein are bullish. Melius says chips now make up 12% of the S&P 500 and sees upside beyond NVDA and AVGO, adding AMD to its top picks. Bernstein notes strong AI-driven demand and sees growth for AVGO into 2026.

MU beat earnings ($9.3B vs. $8.9B est.), with record DRAM and HBM sales. Shares rose 30% in a month. Data center revenue doubled YoY.

Richard Windsor expects long-term gains for MU, QCOM, 2454. TW, and 005930.KS as AI moves on-device.

Chip stocks continue to lead the market with strong momentum, driven by AI demand. Stocks like AMD, AVGO, BGM, MU, NVDA, and QCOM are positioned to benefit from this trend, supported by robust data center growth and semiconductor innovation.

SOXX (semis ETF) is up 10.5% YTD, outperforming SPY (+4.2%) and XLK (+7.6%). Top holdings: NVDA, AVGO, AMD (24.3% of portfolio).

I used to be a lot more prolific in this sub checking it daily back in 2021-2022, but I rarely visit this sub anymore cause I’ve realized how much of an echo chamber it truly is and overall has a negative effect on actually making sound investments. I’ll check this sub once every few months now and post a comment when I’m bored. 

Granted, Im just a retail investor typing a comment on reddit, so take this for what it’s worth. My portfolio was around $700,000 in 2022 and is now sitting around $1.9m as of today. My 10 core holding have been Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, ASML, Netflix, Crowdstrike, Shopify, AMD, SOFI, and MSCI. 

If you’re starting to get nervous with how much this market is continuing to run up, shrugging off and ignoring any bad news or bad economic data, you’re not alone. Here is what I’m doing, again, take it for what it’s worth.

I’m not fighting the trend. I’m fully 100% invested into equities and letting the momentum ride higher for the time being. I have a pretty high level of conviction that we will see new all-time highs on the S&P500 soon, which will force more hedge funds and institutions to reallocate back to being overweight equities fueling us even higher, because they cannot afford to miss another rally. Financial conditions are still loose, banks are still lending, people are still spending, stocks going back to near all-time highs has loosened financial conditions even more via the wealth effect and more spending, there is still too much money floating around, too much spending, and too much positive momentum for the market to roll over and head lower without a black swan event.

With that said. I am not buying at all at the moment, I am building as much cash as I can right now. Additionally, I have already identified around 30-40% of my equity holdings that I will trim, minimizing capital gains tax as much as possible, once I see the leading economic indicators start seriously bringing down the cyclical portion of the economy. 

The business cycle happens if four sequences, starting with the leading economy, then the cyclical economy, followed by the aggregate economy, followed by the lagging economy. Initially, you will always see pain and degradation in the leading economy first, this is how the business cycle works, which we are seeing in spades currently, just check the conference board leading economic index https://www.conference-board.org/topics/us-leading-indicators

Eventually and inevitably, the pain in the leading economy then bleeds into the cyclical economy next, because the cyclical economy is the most interest rate sensitive portion of the economy in manufacturing and housing construction. Right now the cyclical economy is declining, but not nearly enough to bring down the aggregate economy. The aggregate economy is still rising, hence why we are still seeing a low headline unemployment rate and decent job creation via NFP. 

However, with how much the leading economy is still continuing to drop to this day, it will inevitably bring down the cyclical economy much more in the near future, which in turn will eventually be enough to effect the aggregate economy and you will see a spike in unemployment and plummeting in job creation in NFP. 

So what I’m I watching for? Well, I am NOT watching the headline unemployment rate, job creation in non-farm payrolls, or services PMI report at all. That’s because these are all lagging indicators, and not indicative of whether or not a recession is coming. Once you start seeing a rise in headline unemployment, a plummeting in job creation in NFP, and services PMI tank, the recession will already be underway and it’s too late. 

What I am watching is the conference board leading economic index (which continues to drop), showing more pain is building in the pipeline.

And even more closely I’m watching the leading indicators of the cyclical economy. Such as overall headline manufacturing PMI and new orders, manufacturing employment (specifically in durable goods), building permit authorizations for single family homes, home builders profit margins, and initial and continuing jobless claims. Once I start seeing more significant degradation in these leading indicators in the cyclical economy, I’ll be trimming around 30-40% of my equities I have already picked out to cash to be ready to deploy before the degradation in the cyclical economy bleeds into the aggregate economy and causes the inevitable recession. 

Remember, with how much the leading economic index has dropped over the last 3 years. That’s all pain in the pipeline that has yet to fully come to fruition. The lag time of feeling that pain has just been exponentially increased this time around due to the most extensive and substantial fiscal stimulus we received in decades due to the COVID and the complete economic shutdown. This has allowed consumers to continue to spend and fuel the economy much longer than historically normal, even through higher rates and financial tightening by the Fed. RKLB WTF I love this company Brutal. USD value relative to my currency is on 2018 levels. -3% in just a week. Comparing to Oct'21 it's down -25%.

1lkt79a,2025-06-26,"ASML as a partial hedge for NVDA?
I was discussing this with a friend. Both are huge in the semiconductor industry but ASML is a better monopoly. If demand for semiconductors continues to rise, wouldn't ASML benefit as much as Nvidia being a critical part of the supply chain but with the additional benefit of revenue from other chip designers if you're worried about rising competition against Nvidia? For the same reason, wouldn't ASML partially hedge against a decline in Nvidia's stock if you're worried about Nvidia's valuation but bullish on semiconductors? Also, ASML itself is very cutting edge on the innovation with hyper-NA etc.

To be clear, I would still hold Nvidia I'm just wondering if this logic of using ASML to cover a bit of Nvidia is sound.

EDIT: Hedge is the wrong word. Diversify fits the situation I'm describing much better
Wouldn’t be much of a hedge as they’re both in the semiconductor industry- the industry is historically cyclical so likely rises and falls together. 

That being said not an expert on semis, do your own DD. 

GL! Next up I want to hedge my BHP position with vale..... yea, they're both in the same field lmao. If Nvidia got taken down, ASML would most likely go down with them. 

Not an expert in this field either, don't own any semis. Why hedge against Nvidia instead of going all in? 

Asml isn't even cheap compared to NVDA, and Nvidia has better margins.

I like VGT both as a hedge and as an emergency fund. It is VERY sound.

as more players enter the game, they would eat up nvidia's profits, yet ASML will keep trucking along.

at least this is a very real possibility.

if arm starts making chips, and a decade later they caught up, this is not likely, but possible.

same with TSM though. if asml loses their monopoly, TSM just gets another supplier and TSM keeps trucking along.

This is why diversification within semis is a good idea. I've got ASML and TSM as I think both play the ""picks and shovels"" role very well, but from different angles. Also I thought both were solid, undervalued stocks when I bought them. Depends entirely on who eats nvidia's lunch, because they too are most likely gonna be just another asml customer. > Because it's the market leader? I'm wary of competitors taking market share away from the leader long term

You don't know how long that will take if it does occur. Not exactly apples-to-apples, but I've read *countless* posts about how this, that and the other was *certain* to disrupt Visa for over 10 years now. People were *certain* that AMD would catch up to NVDA a year or two ago and it really hasn't happened and still doesn't look to be any time soon. 

I'm also not getting how ASML would only benefit if NVDA lost while others gained. I mean as you said I guess it would be a minimal partial hedge, mainly just against Nvidia being overvalued but still liking semiconductors as a whole. That said, someone else has already pointed out the cyclical nature of the industry so I’m not sure how much extra value you’re getting from splitting between the 2 vs going all in on one Yeah, I was thinking the same, but I’d go with AMD instead of Nvidia since I already have ASML. I just think AMD will eventually catch up a bit and take some market share from Nvidia. For me, it’s kind of a hedge for ASML—mainly because ASML's a European stock and doesn’t spike as hard.

Curious as to what everyone is holding for United Health. I’m a massive believer that its troubles are largely fixable and the turnaround story is going to be one for the ages.

What’s your 12 month PT?

For me

$525 (it may sound crazy but that’s legitimately what my math suggests)

Any news, feel free to post here also 

I got lucky when the shit hit the window and nabbed a bunch of shares at $249. Even if it trades sideways for the rest of my life, it pays a good dividend. There hasn't been a lot of selling and the sideways trading looks more like accumulation to me. If it does sell off then the recent lows will break for sure and the bottom from there is anyone's guess. If the Big, Beautiful Bill passes with medicaid restrictions a lot of health care stocks are going to get pounded.

https://www.investopedia.com/health-insurance-stocks-sink-on-a-medicaid-warning-from-unitedhealth-ceo-8655310

""Shares of health insurers dropped Wednesday after the CEO of UnitedHealth Group warned about lower premium payments as Medicaid rolls shrink"" Point taken, but I'll just point out that article is almost a year and one month old and the statement is from the old CEO, not the current one, Stephen Hemsley. I own 100 shares, selling covered calls to get paid while it trades sideways with a strike price set at a handsome profit. I am highly bullish on UNH but its going to take time, this isnt an immediate bounce back situation. People gotta be ready to hold for a year or more. I expect sideways price movement until at least the next earnings call given that guidance was pulled and institutional investors are looking for reassurance before dipping their toes back in. Sell covered calls for a strike price about 25% above current share price with 2 month expiration date. Collect about $500 every 2 months. This isnt a volatile growth stock so I expect a very low chance strike price is reached in that time frame. If it goes on a tear and hits it then I am happy to sell at that price anyway with a 25% profit in 2 months, win-win. I have a tiny position just as a tracker. It's too complex for me to really wrap my head around to develop high conviction. Anytime there's a lot of regulations and dependencies I get overwhelmed and place it in the too hard pile. Plus reading up on healthcare and healthcare insurance bores me, so not a lot of motivation to dig deep. I’ve found much better dividends out there so I’m looking to offload mine when I get a decent return. Value isn’t there for me.  Hedge funds are keep the price boxed between $290-$310.

1lkb2v2,2025-06-25,"Nvidia is ripping again  are we seriously doing this??So can NVDA break the spell and continue to break new highs?
NVDA is back on a heater. Stock's flying past $150 and it’s looking like we might break the January highs. Honestly… didn’t think we’d be back here this fast after that dumpster fire earlier this year

Remember when it tanked to the low $90s? Between Trump’s China chip ban, Huawei heating up, and that random DeepSeek AI hype? I thought the bubble had popped. But nope  earnings beat, Saudi/UAE deals, and now here we are again

Now I’m seeing $250 PTs getting thrown around like it’s no big deal. $6T market cap? 

 So real talk:Are you still buying here?Is this just the AI hype train picking up steam again?If you’re holding, are you trimming or riding it out?If not NVDA, what are you playing instead? AMD? AVGO? Or just indexing and chilling?

I’ve been sitting on the sidelines and ngl, I’m feeling a little FOMO

But on the flip side, Nvidia really seems to be a one-of-a-kind presence. While others are still in the middle of a marathon, it's already taking selfies on the podium



  

If you didn't panic sell at $94, congrats  you passed the investor IQ test At this point I'm not even sure if people are investing in Nvidia or in Jensen's leather jacket Relevant username I panic sold at $30 like 10 years ago after it dropped like $2… and they went through several splits. Up like 40,000% since. RIP. Last time I bought some NVDA was march of this year and I’m still up nearly 400% on it overall. I think im pretty much done and happy with my holdings. Will hold for at least the next 4 years. Bro it’s literally a monopoly on printing GPUs and printing money. I'm not selling until my toaster runs ChatGPT I've seen his jacket up close in person.  Looked sleak and expensive. I think anyone whose lived through the dotcom bubble knows that investing in NVDA right now is like picking up pennies in front of a freight train. To put things in perspective, with a 3.9% increase Nvidia's market cap rose more *today alone* than the combined total profit that Nvidia has earned since the company was created in 1993.

So yes there might be some room left to make more money but there could be a lot of risk if a market downturn starts chipping away at Nvidia's revenue or profit margin Im not selling but I’m not buying either.

1lkaq7n,2025-06-25,"DeepMind Just Launched AlphaGenome A Big Step For DNABased AI And Genomics
I don't know how many people have noticed this but Google DeepMind has just released a new tool called AlphaGenome which aims to model how genetic variation affects the biological processes that regulate gene expression.

This is the same team behind AlphaFold and AlphaMissense Unusually instead of limiting itself to the 2 per cent of the genome that codes for proteins the focus of most older models AlphaGenome seeks to account for the remaining 98 per cent known as non-coding regions These regions control the on off switching of genes and are linked to a range of diseaseassociated mutations.

It can analyse up to a million DNA base pairs and predict thousands of regulatory features. Apparently it has already outperformed existing tools in 22 out of 24 benchmark tests and passed 24 out of 26 tests related to identifying disease-associated mutations. That impressive.

This model is a milestone  Caleb Lareau MSKCC 

It brings a foundational level of accuracy long-range context and versatility in a unified model.

Currently it is only available as an Application Programming Interface API and is non-commercial but if this technology is validated and deployed into biotechpharma R&D workflows it could dramatically accelerate rare disease research gene therapy and even cancer diagnostics.

No investment thesis here yet but worth tracking for anyone long on GOOGL This is the kind of moonshot stuff that could pay off 3–5 years down the road, especially as AI moves deeper into biohealth.

Google DeepMind released AlphaGenome  an AI model for analyzing DNA regulationOutperforms other tools in most benchmarksCould help identify disease mutations in the 98% of the genome we barely understandStill early but a solid long-term signal for anyone tracking AI x biotechGOOGL up \~2.4% today, possibly partially on this


Impressive benchmarks, but we’ve seen models overpromise before. The key will be actual adoption in pharma pipelines. Still, it’s a strong signal of where AI in biotech is heading How will Google monetise this? I feel I've been hearing about DeepMind doing a bunch of cool stuff and biotech breakthroughs around DNA for years but no indication of how this makes money. Exactly Benchmarks look great on paper, but realworld traction is what matters Pharma a slow-moving beast  until we see this plugged into actual pipelines or trials it just potential.

TSLA sliding today, and it looks like Europe might be a big reason. That’s 5 months in a row of declining sales over there, even though overall EV demand in the region is still growing

Makes sense to be cautious. The fact that EV demand is still growing in Europe but Tesla is losing ground suggests a shift in competitive dynamics — not just macro weakness Brand fatigue or pricing strategy might be the culprit This is what happens when your CEO spends more time tweeting politics than building cars We also seem to have stronger views on not buying products from companies whose CEO does Nazi salutes over here I believe he’s managed to piss off a majority of Americans.

QuantumScape just dropped a bombshell they’ve successfully integrated their “Cobra separator” into baseline production of their solid-state lithium-metal batteries

Solid-state = next-gen EV batteries

Cobra = smaller equipment, more efficient manufacturing

This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

Today is mainly focused on breakouts/breakdowns.

This is still extremely run up (to me). Note that it is mainly run up due to the hype from the senate bill (GENIUS Act). Overall trying to see if we get even close to breaking $200 today. Cbase and HOOD have moved as well (upwards). Typically has a somewhat wide spread (ranges from .50 to $1) so I'm mainly trying to churn as little in this as possible. 

[**NVO (Novo Nordisk)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVO&p=d)\-Still somewhat selling off due to news from their discontinuation of their discontinuation with HIMS, citing illegal practices. Interested in if we can break the multi-day lows of $68. Fragment of a comment I read: ""Hims/Hers is advertising Wegovy all over the place, but if you go through their signup process, they have you fill out a questionnaire to supposedly see which medication is best for you. And if you say price is a big factor for you, then they recommend their own compound meds over the name brand."" According to NVO, the decision comes after Hims & Hers allegedly failed to comply with laws prohibiting mass sales of compounded drugs.

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\-Nearing $150 levels and ATH, driven by the market momentum we've had lately (also unveiled the 5050 for their cheapest GPU yet but I doubt it's what's moving the needle on this stock.) Mainly interested in a technical breakout at $150 if it forms. We're nearing it premarket, but I'm mainly interested to see if this breaks it in a significant way at the open.

[**FDX (FedEx)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FDX&p=d)\-FDX reports Adjusted EPS of $6.07). FDX declined to issue full-year earnings and revenue forecasts, citing uncertainty over U.S. trade policy with China.

>The technology is in its early stages - DealBook hears that it involves both OpenAI’s Sora video software and its robotics team - but commercializing it is still a distant goal. An OpenAI spokesman declined to comment.

>That could make Altman even more of a competitor to Elon Musk, who co-founded OpenAI but has since waged war on the company. (A short reminder: Musk has sued to try to stop OpenAI from revamping its corporate structure, and he’s building a direct competitor, xAI, that’s raising - and spending - billions of dollars.)

>Autonomous vehicles are key to Musk’s vision for Tesla, which he increasingly sees as the producer of huge fleets of fully self-driving cars. Tesla is focusing on A.I.-powered vision rather than on the array of sensors like lidar that Waymo, a Google spinoff, uses.

>One big question mark for OpenAI: Where will its systems get their data? Tesla and Waymo have already amassed huge amounts of information and video through their years of driving on the roads.

>That raises the question of whether OpenAI believes in a fundamentally different approach to self-driving tech, one that relies less on real-world data and more on advanced simulation, synthetic data or a breakthrough in “generalizable” A.I. Of note: The company recently collaborated with Applied Intuition, a start-up focused on putting A.I. in cars.

>(OpenAI’s venture arm also invested in Ghost Autonomy, a self-driving start-up, though the business folded last year.)

>“I think he really gets it,” Altman said of President Trump’s approach to A.I. (Altman has forged close ties to the president, including by donating to his inauguration fund and announcing the Stargate data center project at the White House.) “I think he really understands the importance of leadership in this technology.”

>Altman was uncertain about whether the right A.I. regulations would come to pass: “I have become a bit more, jaded isn’t the right word, but it’s something in that direction, about the ability of policymakers to grapple with the speed of technology.”

>Altman played down reports of tensions between OpenAI and Microsoft as they rework their relationship: “Do you believe that, when you read those things?”

1lk2wb3,2025-06-25,"Why Qualcomm’s Latest Price Target Can’t Be Ignored
As we head into the final week of June, **Qualcomm** continues to test investors’ patience. Even with a fundamentally solid earnings report in April and a tidy 25% gains since then, the tech giant is failing to ignite the kind of sustained uptrend seen in bigger peers like **NVIDIA** or **Broadcom**. Shares have been drifting downwards for nearly two weeks, though Monday’s 1% gain showed some welcome strength. The uptrend that began in April is technically still intact, but only just.

This lack of momentum has been especially frustrating given Qualcomm’s healthy diversification across handsets, automotive, and the Internet of Things (IoT), not to mention its recent M&A activity.

And yet, analyst coverage has been sparse in comparison to other major chipmakers. That’s why last week’s update from Bank of America can’t be ignored.

# Bank of America Sees at Least 30% Upside

Bank of America’s research team, led by Tal Liani,reiterated its Buy rating on Qualcomm, though it trimmed its price target from $245 to $200. It’s a noteworthy move, while they’ve tempered expectations, they still see roughly 30% upside from where the stock closed on Monday.

Their reasoning was clear. As we mentioned above, Qualcomm’s Q2 earnings were solid, with the numbers coming in ahead of analyst expectations pretty much across the board. Its QCT segment, which includes the company’s core chip business, and its Handsets did especially well, while Automotive and IOT were both impressive too.

# Potential Headwinds for Qualcomm

The problem, though, according to Bank of America, is that some of its sales trends are showing signs of stagnation. As **Apple** , one of Qualcomm’s key customers, continues to bring more and more of its manufacturing in-house, Bank of America now expects its contribution to headset sales to fall sharply and potentially disappear altogether. That’s a huge headwind for a company still heavily dependent on smartphone cycles.

Still, they believe Qualcomm’s AI PCs and data center growth can offset some of the drag, though the company is lacking any near-term catalysts that could spark renewed bullishness. All that being said, however, their updated $200 target reflects a 15x multiple on their 2026 earnings estimate, which keeps Qualcomm looking extremely cheap relative to the sector. The stock’s current forward P/E sits below 14, in stark contrast to NVIDIA’s 46.

These risks aren’t new, but taken together, they help explain why the stock has struggled to build lasting momentum. The Bank of America team could easily have downgraded the stock to a Hold, but they didn’t, and investors should take confidence from that.

And with the stock trading at a highly unusual discount to its peers from a valuation standpoint, you can’t help but feel there’s a bargain to be had here - you might just have to wait a little longer than is ideal for the payoff.

# Watch the Chart

From a technical standpoint, Qualcomm is approaching an inflection point. Last week’s update would have helped spur some bullish interest, but the stock has been effectively trending down for the past fortnight. Crucially, the MACD just completed a bearish crossover, and momentum could turn negative if shares don’t start rallying north soon.

Given the S&P 500 index is on the verge of an all-time record close, bulls will want to see Qualcomm move back towards $160 this week, which would mean it avoids setting a lower low and risking a breakdown of the uptrend.

As AI and edge computing continue to drive long-term demand, stocks like QCOM, AVGO, MAAS, MSFT, MU, and TXN could benefit from renewed infrastructure and device-side innovation, especially in areas like IoT and automotive connectivity.

For investors willing to stomach some near-term volatility, Qualcomm offers an intriguing mix of value, optionality, and a long-term AI tailwind. The latest analyst commentary should serve as a reminder that while the potential mightn’t be as bright as some others out there, it’s far from lost. But unless shares can shake off the lethargy and recapture momentum soon, it may take another upside surprise to get the stock firing again.
Reminds me of GOOG. Solid fundamentals but doesn’t move. At this point I'm treating the concept of a ""price target"" purely as filler for the largely worthless noise of financial media. The problem with Qualcomm is their reliance on China & Taiwan both for their supplychain and their revenue.

In 2024 the revenue generated from China was 66%... Imagine what tariffs will do to them?

Thats the main reason the stock is down.. their overreliance is a huge risk right now... If tarrifs with china are positive they should boom.. If not their bust... >This lack of momentum has been especially frustrating given Qualcomm’s healthy diversification across handsets, automotive, and the Internet of Things (IoT), not to mention its recent M&A activity.

Here's your ""problem"" - none of this is growing like gangbusters.  We're seeing high single digit to mid teens growth at best.  AVGO has doubled their revenue over the past 3 years , while NVDA has more than doubled their revenue over 2 consecutive years.  

It doesn't mean QCOM is a bad company by any means, but they're not even in the same league as AVGO and NVDA in the current lifecycle.  Share price erformance of these stocks the past few years reflects the actual performance of the companies. You keep trying to make QCOM happen, but it's not happening. You are streets behind.

1ljqajv,2025-06-24,"Market feels rigged but I’m still buying dips like a clown  FSLR ENVX NVDA thoughts?
Not sure if anyone else feels this way but this market just doesn’t trade like it used to

NVDA still grinding up despite no one being able to justify the valuation anymore Yeah, they printed but multiple expansion on top of that? Come on Feels like we playing hot potato with trilliondollar market caps now.

At the same time look at stuff like FSLR  record earnings massive backlog Biden literally throwing tax credits at solar yet the stock gets faded like it stole someone lunch Is this just rotation or is something fundamentally broken?

ENVX is another name I’ve been watching Battery tech seems legit management finally got their act together and yet it trades like a penny stock that survived off meme hype I averaged down under $10 feels like suicide or genius depending on the week.

Also SMCI can’t catch a bid even though everyone and their grandma thinks they printing money off AI servers It either the most obvious long of the year or a setup for a fullon rug pull.

Curious what you all are doing right now Rotating into safety? Still riding momentum? Or just staying in cash and doomscrolling?

Not looking for advice  just wondering if I’m the only one feeling like this market makes zero sense lately.


Stocks are overvalued AND the economy/ whole world is having lots of uncertainty/problems/future problems I’d say Nvidia is at a fair valuation right now considering the massive AI growth cycle we’re in. Looking at charts, revenue, free cash flow, cash to debt, eps, return on capital, etc is all up and to the right AND accelerating. 

I don’t know if you’ve been living under a rock, but the reason FSLR is getting sold off is because solar tax credits are likely to be gone soon after cuts. Everything solar is in the can right now.

If your portfolio isn’t going up right now, you’re in bad names. That’s about it. As long as Trump is in office, there will always be uncertainty. The best thing you can do is buy and hold companies you like with a strong probability for growth. Market multiples don’t really matter if you’re planning on being in a name more than 3 years. If Trump's OBBB passes, all solar incentives go away

This is not necessarily a bad thing for $FSLR in the long run because it will weed out quite a few competition

At least in sunny places (CA, FL, TX), utility solar + battery combo is already cheaper than NG **without subsidies**. But I would not jump into $FSLR now because the uncertainty and volatility are just too great In today’s market, it’s the fundamentals that are overvalued. Ive been buying dips all year in VOO and its worked wonderfully. Yeah FSLR will fare better because it’s mostly large commercial. Anything left that relies on residential like ENPH, SEDG, RUN will drop more. It’s a bizarre time. There’s good money to be made right now but have a sell rule or even a stop sell on everything. If someone told you Israel and Iran will bomb each other and Iran will bomb US bases in Iraq and the market would shrug it off, what would you have said? i was hella bearish a couple months ago as the market was rebounding, but think of like the market is just rebounding to where it was going to go before the tariff announcement. I think there are quite a lot of names that are very overvalued, but semis and mag7 were flat for almost a year and it seemed like they were going to rise again this summer but tariff drama unnaturally pulled everything down, and now they have been slingshotted back up.

1ljpglb,2025-06-24,"Selling NVDA, buying RDDT & HOOD
Cost basis was $108 for NVDA.  Of course NVDA has a monopoly for AI hardware, but there's not enough headroom (a 50% price increase would be a $5.4T market cap).

RDDT's narrative is simple - they offer a unique dataset in a sea lacking in human creativity and insight.

HOOD - partly a momentum play, but they have captured a large portion of the retail investor base (especially mid to upper middle class), which is becoming an increasingly dominant force in the markets.

Anyone else selling NVDA for something else?
Buying RDDT at $100: No.

Buying RDDT at $150: Yes. I bought Reddit today but selling nvda is dumb Reddit gives the illusion of insight when in fact it's a lot of manipulated and controlled echo chambers, at least for big subs.  Controlled narratives by mods, by actors astroturfing upvotes and downvotes, of actors posting narratives that their agents astroturf with the aforementioned up and downvotes.

IMO it's a house of cards in terms of value, as are many social media platforms.

  
btw I don't own Nvidia but wish I had some.  I'd just hold it long term, I hate you so much right now bringing this up. I didn’t hate it at $100, I loved it at $100…and…just…never…pulled…the…trigger 😭  Now I’ve gotta decide if I still love it at $150 enough to risk being a bag holder for awhile.

He normalized absurd tariffs by proposing insane tariffs and people just accept and laugh about TACO.  This is called anchoring effect btw.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring\_effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_effect) Stocks are going up because everyone believes Trump will fold and so far he did.

If he changes his opinion and more importantly sticks with it for a month where companies start to pay new amounts then market or our economy will not react nicely.

1ljhbcx,2025-06-24,"TSLA has been a terrible buy and hold
From 1/4/2021 to 6/23/25 TSLA has gone up 43.34%

In the same time frame, MSFT (+123.25%), GOOGL (+91.39%), META (+159.74%), NFLX (139.75%), AAPL (+55.71%), S&P (+62.81%), and QQQ (+71.88%) have all outperformed. 

The only Mag 7 stock to not outperform TSLA has been AMZN (+30.84%).

What’s crazier still is that none of these numbers include dividends.

Also, as a side note: what’s even crazier still is that I looked at a forgotten about legacy company called General Electric. They are up a whopping 374.46% over the same time frame not including their dividend.

I would say the only redeeming quality of TSLA is that in this 4.5 year frame their PE ratio has dropped from ~1100 to 200. This just goes to show how much valuation and time matter. A great company can have a wildly inaccurate price and you are left with nothing while it grows into its valuation.

Also worth noting their revenue has been completely flat since reporting Q2 of 2023 while gross profit has fallen by ~20%. Their net earnings per share has collapsed 50% during this time.

Lots of the last 2 years have been when Musk was involved with his politics. Maybe he can turn it around now, but either way, the current valuation does not leave much room for any sort of stock price appreciation. The only thing they can hope for now is to get EPS back growing positive instead of consistently negative Q/Q
Maximum cherry-picking This is quite the cherry picked statistic with an arbitrary time frame

Tesla is up 436% over the past 5 years while the SP500 is up only 100% and nasdaq up 125%

If you bought Tesla in 2019, it went up 2087%. It has been an insane buy and hold investment. Whats the significance of 1/4/2021? Why not do 5 years? Shhhh hes trying to make a political point that he doesn't like Elon Musk Then sell it. Imagine bitching about 43% return.  🙄🙄 Congratulations, you’ve discovered the strategy of picking any time frame you desire and selecting a return.

Tesla returns have been wildly successful and will continue to do so as they scale massively in their future product offerings.

1ljcswg,2025-06-24,"GOOGL - the perfect GARP play through 2030?
GOOGL is entering bearish territory in the short-term.

Long-term, it remains an attractive GARP stock (17 P/E, 50% EPS growth, 56% gross margin).

Yes, ChatGPT is a competitor to Google Search, but not an existential threat (at least this decade). The market has overreacted to the LLM threat, and hence why it has been trading sideways.

Google's AI team is top-notch - their research laid the foundations for ChatGPT. They are likely able to monetize not only their LLM (Gemini), but also their AI prowess elsewhere.

Remember, Google also owns a wealth of data and the infrastructure (Cloud, TPUs).

GOOGL is the rare megacap tech with margin of safety, optionality, and runway.

Anyone disagree?
[removed] the stock will not move until the google posts stop Alright, you got the Google post for the day. This stock literally just comes down to whether or not you think search revenue is at risk. That is LITERALLY it. 

All of the other stuff that people talk about when these threads come up. Waymo (TAM is not as high/exciting as you think, margins might not be great), Quantum (please stop talking about quantum), Gemini (no path to monetization), lawsuits are basically on their cost of goods sold line at this point. Cloud growth is nice but is dwarfed by search in terms of impact.

Everything comes down to whether or not LLMs are going to eat into market share in the long-term. I am long on Google because I think that LLMs will eat into non-monetizable traffic and won't for their cash cow search volume. But I'm still nervous. I remember when META stock was in the gutters, and everybody on here hated it. Not the case for GOOG. And META was like 13 PE at the time. I got dibs on posting tomorrow It was at risk until they put Gemini in Google search. Now I don't have to search for Gemini before my actual search and my keywords can be more conversationional in the search bar Search revenue growth rate has only accelerated since 2022. Not only has it not declined but it’s growing faster than it was before.  

Robotaxi is large tho. Teslas nonexistent robotaxi business is valued at over 1T. That everyone and their friends were moving off Facebook, leaving only grandmas and old heads on Facebook.

Plus Zuck burning through fat cash on Metaverse R&D. What’s hilarious is that was true and remains true. But the pie kept growing. Meta had shrinking revenues, flat DAU's, and massively compressing margins. Zuck was also burning 10's of billions on the Metaverse with laughable results.

1ljas6z,2025-06-24,"(06/24) Second Day Movers- Interesting Stocks Today!
This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

Today is mainly second-day movers from news yesterday.

News: [Iran Israel War Updates](https://apnews.com/live/iran-israel-war-updates-6-24-2025)

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- NHTSA pressed Tesla for more information after robotaxi incidents caught on camera showed lane departures and speeding in Austin (this hasn't actually moved the stock but interesting to see how this ultimately plays out). TSLA surged massively yesterday (325->359) because of the robotaxi launch on Sunday, and streamers caught some traffic violations. Most obvious catalyst here is if regulators pull Robotaxi out of Austin, but I doubt that will happen. Also interseted to see if we move up for a second day. 

[**USO (United States Oil Fund)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=USO&p=d)/[**XLE (Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=XLE&p=d)\-President Trump accused both Israel and Iran of violating a ceasefire he helped broker yesterday. We saw the market move up yesterday (and oil fall) due to Trump saying that the Israel and Iran conflict was set to end in a ceasefire. This may be a telegraphed move to say that the ceasefire might not hold. If so then we may see a surge in oil if the conflict continues and the market fall. Overall I'm mainly interested in the moves of oil because this actually hasn't budged VIX too much. 

[**CRCL (Circle)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&p=d)\-Crypto “rules of the road” framework unveiled by Senators. The bipartisan GENIUS Act passed the Senate 68–30 to regulate stableCs. CRCL moved up to $299 yesterday and then sell off after a MASSIVE move since the IPO- I think that the selloff from the move was saved primarily due to Trump's announcement of the Iran/Israel ceasefire (which caused the entire market to move up). We might see another selloff today- still short biased in this and not interested in this long. 

Random risks I'm thinking of that could kill momentum: The bill now has to pass the House; dilution by the STABLE Act could change issuer oversight, and international competition (Tether) could beat this in the longrun. 

[**NTRS (Northern Trust Corp)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NTRS&p=d)\-Northern Trust shares surged Friday \~8% after reports that Bank of New York Mellon approached the company about a potential merger. Overall wasn't an extremely interesting catalyst but NTRS said they're committed to remaining independent, so we may see additional updates on this. (Most companies that are committed to remaining independent are holding out for a higher buyout price).

1ljaik7,2025-06-24,"Tesla & Google heat up the Robotaxi race  TSLA pops, GOOGL lags
Big moves in the robotaxi world this week.

TSLA just launched its robotaxi service in Austin, TX over the weekend, and the market loved it. The stock ripped +8% on Monday and kept the momentum into Tuesday, pushing up another 2% premarket

Meanwhile, Alphabet’s Waymo (backed by $GOOGL) responded fast announcing its own robotaxi expansion into Atlanta through its Uber partnership. Waymo now runs in LA, Austin, Phoenix, SF, and soon Miami & DC. Solid coverage

What’s surprising though: $GOOGL only got a modest bump (\~1%) while $TSLA surged

Robotaxi = massive long-term play. Whoever wins autonomy could dominate transportation over the next decade

Personally, I’m a bit surprised by the muted reaction on GOOGL. Waymo’s rollout is arguably more polished  it’s already operating in multiple cities and has a real partnership with Uber. But the market still gives the hype crown to Tesla.

GOOGL, on the other hand, feels like it’s building the future… quietly. Maybe too quietly

Still, I wouldn’t count Waymo out. If it scales smoothly with Uber, the upside could sneak up on people
GOOGL feels like the quiet kid who built the project but gets no credit. Meanwhile Tesla showed up with a flashy PowerPoint and took the A+ 😂 And this is proof that the market is not 100% efficient. If Tesla popped from having 10 taxis with someone still in the passenger seat, Google should have gone up twice as much since waymo done that 5 years ago The flashy PowerPoint that looks good but turns out to be misleading, shallow garbage - I’ve been to plenty of meetings like that. Even if Tesla had functioning robotaxis right now the valuation wouldnt be justified. Meme stock. TSLA did a few supervised runs of what Google did 15 years ago. People keep commenting about the advantage of not using Lidar because the cars will be cheaper. Lidar prices have fallen like hardware always does.  If it is $1000 today it will be one dollar in a few years. On the other hand, without Lidar, you would need to do a lot more image processing from multiple cameras using GPUs. To achieve low latency and accuracy you need very powerful and expensive Nvidia processors. That, assuming you have the software which they don't. So the whole notion that Tesla has an advantage is ridiculous. Only a mad CEO would use this approach. TSLA is a memestock. Fundamentals doesn't matter. And dropping hand selected sycophants in the middle of an intersection…. GOOGL has a proven product on the streets, but lags because their company is not run by a blowhard… Holding both. TSLA for the volatility and hype, GOOGL for the long-term fundamentals. Not picking sides  just collecting gains Agreed 100%

And I’ll just add that lidar and radar are seeing things that regular cameras cannot. Waymos are dodging pedestrians before they even walk out from behind other vehicles. They can sense traffic jams on highways in foggy conditions.

If I could make a prediction it will be that Teslas will eventually add more sensors than just cameras, while Waymo will continue to use lidar and radar, but reduce the total number of sensors they currently use.

Plus Waymo is selling a service, not a car. I’m still not sure how Tesla plans to sell a car and then manage a fleet of individuals operating as independent robotaxis. That sounds like a logistical nightmare that Google will manage completely in house.

Nothing in my mind lines up in favor for Tesla.",274,0.83,324,0,Necromantion,stocks,"['TSLA', 'GOOGL']",tesla google heat robotaxi race tsla pops googl lags big moves robotaxi world week tsla launched robotaxi service austin tx weekend market loved stock ripped 8 monday kept momentum tuesday pushing another 2 premarket meanwhile alphabets waymo backed googl responded fast announcing robotaxi expansion atlanta uber partnership waymo runs la austin phoenix sf soon miami dc solid coverage whats surprising though googl got modest bump 1 tsla surged robotaxi massive longterm play whoever wins autonomy could dominate transportation next decade personally im bit surprised muted reaction googl waymos rollout arguably polished already operating multiple cities real partnership uber market still gives hype crown tesla googl hand feels like building future quietly maybe quietly still wouldnt count waymo scales smoothly uber upside could sneak people googl feels like quiet kid built project gets credit meanwhile tesla showed flashy powerpoint took proof market 100 efficient tesla popped 10 taxis someone still passenger seat google gone twice much since waymo done 5 years ago flashy powerpoint looks good turns misleading shallow garbage ive plenty meetings like even tesla functioning robotaxis right valuation wouldnt justified meme stock tsla supervised runs google 15 years ago people keep commenting advantage using lidar cars cheaper lidar prices fallen like hardware always 1000 today one dollar years hand without lidar would need lot image processing multiple cameras using gpus achieve low latency accuracy need powerful expensive nvidia processors assuming software dont whole notion tesla advantage ridiculous mad ceo would use approach tsla memestock fundamentals doesnt matter dropping hand selected sycophants middle intersection googl proven product streets lags company run blowhard holding tsla volatility hype googl longterm fundamentals picking sides collecting gains agreed 100 ill add lidar radar seeing things regular cameras cannot waymos dodging pedestrians even walk behind vehicles sense traffic jams highways foggy conditions could make prediction teslas eventually add sensors cameras waymo continue use lidar radar reduce total number sensors currently use plus waymo selling service car im still sure tesla plans sell car manage fleet individuals operating independent robotaxis sounds like logistical nightmare google manage completely house nothing mind lines favor tesla
1lj810u,2025-06-24,"Geopolitical uncertainty creates attractive environment for AI trade - Wells Fargo
Recent global geopolitical tensions bolster the case for a balance between defensive stocks and trades centered around artificial intelligence, according to analysts at Wells Fargo.

In a note on Tuesday, the brokerage flagged that defensive sectors -- segments that tend to provide relatively stable returns despite ructions in broader markets -- like utilities, staples and real estate all outperformed on Monday despite worries over fighting in the Middle East.

On Tuesday, Israel accused Iran of violating a ceasefire agreement previously announced by U.S. President Donald Trump. Tehran has denied the claim.

Earlier, Trump had declared that the ceasefire between Israel and Iran was now ""in effect,"" adding that neither side should violate it.

The comments suggested that the ceasefire would take place in stages, with operations already underway being allowed to finish. An Iranian missile attack on Israel on Tuesday killed four people, according to Reuters, citing Israel’s ambulance service. Meanwhile, Tehran said an Israeli strike on northern Iran had killed nine people.

Israel, who was joined by the U.S. in its bid to erase Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile ambitions, said it had agreed to a halt in the violence, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu noting that the operation had achieved its objectives.

Still, questions surrounded the longevity of the ceasefire. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi also said Tehran had no intention of continuing its retaliatory strikes moving forward, but stood ready to respond to any further aggression from Israel -- a sentiment that Netanyahu reciprocated.

Oil prices were lower, but trimmed some steeper losses. The Wells Fargo analysts recommended maintaining an ""underweight"" position in energy stocks, saying they ""expect the group to fade.""

The brokerage added that the uncertainty over the trajectory of an air war between Israel and Iran ""creates a more attractive environment for the AI trade.""

""In other words, we can say with a high degree of certainty that AI development and deployment will continue, independent of where the Iran story goes from here,"" the analysts wrote.

They noted that their 25-stock basket of names that provide the tools or technologies needed to underpin AI has risen by 21.2% since early May, outperforming the benchmark S&P 500.

As AI-driven investments gain traction amid ongoing geopolitical uncertainty, stocks like ETN, AVGO, MAAS, DLR, VST, and GEV may benefit from sustained interest in infrastructure and technology platforms powering next-gen automation.

What a waste of time this has been People mad the market is hitting new ATHs are simply tunnel visioned. Just keep it simple - big tech and mega caps are still printing money, earnings are still strong, there is MASSIVE liquidity since covid stimulus, and the market completely desensitized (""nothing ever happens""). 

DCA always and forever In 2017, Google published their landmark paper “Attention is All You Need” which introduced the transformer architecture and kickstarted the AI revolution.

Also in 2017, ICE-FIGHT started DCA-ing into GOOG and has somehow lost money. Taking the title of the aforementioned paper literally, he has let everyone know multiple times per day how much he has lost on his long position. Moment of silence for the people in april who sold stocks at the bottom, and bought gold at the top. congrats to all the DCA'ers who stuck with the plan.

1liuyta,2025-06-23,"Any guesses on when MSFT will split shares?
I’ve been a firm believer that MSFT will split after they hit $500/share. 

I have nothing to base this off of besides peers doing splits in the $400-900 range. 

Amazon, Google and Teslerr were the three peers’ splits that come to mind. 

Disclosure: I have a tiny stake in MSFT but if it’s splits I may end up with 100 shares, then I’ll sell CCs off into the sunset.

Thoughts on if or when we’ll see a split from MSFT?



They will make a press release if the board of the company decides to do so. He wants 100 shares so he can sell CCs Some bitch ass new investor/current investors are gonna see that it’s affordable and fucking buy it Surprised Meta hasn't split either. I know splitting is really irrelevant, but typically once a stock splits it goes up post split for a bit. It’s the perception that it’s affordable that gets em EOY and/or before $600/share What’s the point of a company splitting? I mean I understand that the stock will be cheaper to buy, but then there are companies like Netflix and Costco whose stock cost over a thousand dollars. ASML I think was also over a thousand at one point. So how come some do it and others don’t? Stocks split so they remain accessible to retail investors. Brokers that offer fractional share trading hold some shares of every equity they offer fractional trading on to facilitate, the more expensive a stock the more burdensome it is for brokers to offer fractional trading for a given security.  It also helps with liquidity a tiny bit. 

On the flip side, some companies avoid ever splitting because they want to use their large share price as a sort of marketing to investors to highlight how they have been able to grow over time. The price doesn't change anything. It only attracts new investors. 

NVDA split last year 1 to 10. 

Do you think more people will invest at $1400 or 140? lol Stock splits can be helpful for keeping option contracts values reasonable, since they represent 100x of the underlying. Most / all companies do it at some point, unless they are Berkshire. And even Berkshire has different class shares for that purpose.",0,0.41,30,0,DrHarrisonLawrence,stocks,"['MSFT', 'GOOGL']",guesses msft split shares ive firm believer msft split hit 500share nothing base besides peers splits 400900 range amazon google teslerr three peers splits come mind disclosure tiny stake msft splits may end 100 shares ill sell ccs sunset thoughts well see split msft make press release board company decides wants 100 shares sell ccs bitch ass new investorcurrent investors gonna see affordable fucking buy surprised meta hasnt split either know splitting really irrelevant typically stock splits goes post split bit perception affordable gets em eoy andor 600share whats point company splitting mean understand stock cheaper buy companies like netflix costco whose stock cost thousand dollars asml think also thousand one point come others dont stocks split remain accessible retail investors brokers offer fractional share trading hold shares every equity offer fractional trading facilitate expensive stock burdensome brokers offer fractional trading given security also helps liquidity tiny bit flip side companies avoid ever splitting want use large share price sort marketing investors highlight able grow time price doesnt change anything attracts new investors nvda split last year 1 10 think people invest 1400 140 lol stock splits helpful keeping option contracts values reasonable since represent 100x underlying companies point unless berkshire even berkshire different class shares purpose
1lirftv,2025-06-23,"Tesla Robotaxi goes live  stock rockets TSLA will continue to rise   or is it going cold?
Fellow TSLA observers, checking in  As you may have seen  Tesla made big news recently: self-driving cabs (Robotaxi) officially went live in Austin charging only $4.20 per order (yup  Musk is playing the game again) 

On June 23rd, Tesla launched a trial run of Robotaxi in Austin  Texas Pricing is $4.20 per order  and it still has a human safety officer sitting in the car  but it has already begun to pay for external operations News As soon as the news came out Tesla stock spiked 8-10% straight up in pre-market to close near $348-$350 for the day 

Is TSLA up or down?

So far: TSLA is still running high  shares around $349. 8%+ one-day spike after Robotaxi

Year-to-date: while cumulative year-to-date is still in the -7% to -14% range (depending on where you start)  shares have rallied 35-40% since Robotaxi news

Reasons for the rally: 

Significant inflection point: this is the first step in making real money from Autopilot  This is the first step for autonomous driving to start making real money  there are still safeties, but this is a major breakthrough 

Valuation: UBS raised their price target from $190 to $215 (though still cautious) Cathie Wood continues to be bullish as well 

Macro-help: the Fed has become more dovish, and the overall broader market is optimistic  which also gives room for the rally to continue



Will it continue to rise or will it be prototyped?

Has the positive sentiment been overdrawn? UBS thinks Robotaxi's upside may have factored in a \~$99 share price premium 

Regulatory risk: Texas has made it clear that licenses are required by September, and there have already been some fines for non-compliance 

Musk risk: public opinion swirls  protesters  and political pressures are all over the place Investors can easily get scared 

Valuation is still expensive: even if it's profitable now, TSLA is still trading at a valuation of 170x 2025 expected profits. It's already outrageous 

TSLA is currently trading around $349 with intraday volume of \~176 million shares The trading range of $323-$357.5 is approaching the technical pressure level of $360-$370 

In a nutshell: the launch of Robotaxi is indeed a big positive The stock has surged by about 8-10%  Currently oscillating at $349 but a lot of the good has already been reflected 

Long view: this is a real turning point  Revenue modeling, branding, voice, and execution are all perfect scores  If technology and regulation keep up  it could continue to fly

Short view: valuation is too high  public opinion is too risky, and policy is too unstable  so it's not uncommon for the market to sell the news at any time  so it's not uncommon to see the market go higher



Do you think Robotaxi is a real long term change or a short term hype?

Anyone planning to wait for a pullback ($320-330) before getting in? Or are you ready to dump at $360?
Tesla added 3x Waymo’s entire value with ~10 rides I have absolutely no faith in Tesla as a company or its stock price reflecting reality in any way Musk math maths

Still waiting for this house of cards to fall. I’m avoiding it. But, I wouldn’t be surprised if it rises until they’re sued for something and then it’ll go higher. If they have live safety drivers in each car, and are charging 4.20 per ride, they are losing money in every ride. This is NOT cash flow positive. I mean, it has to eventually but I'm not going to bet on that timeline. Losing money is bullish for future growth Google should just rename Waymo to Assla and IPO it at $420.69 on April 20th ""Tesla stock skyrockets to $500 on news the company has filed for bankruptcy.""

1lipg45,2025-06-23,"Google: undervalued tech gem?
I recently started a large (for me) individual position in Google. While I remain bearish on the market as a whole right now, wise investors have said value can always be found in the market. A lot of the market feels very richly valued right now, especially large tech. AAPL, MSFT, NVDA and Meta all carry PE valuations close to 30 at the low end and closer to 50. Google however sits under 20.



Google is a major player in data centers, which I believe will be a huge space in the future. Google also has a strong AI program as well as a very healthy ad program. They continue to grow top and bottom lines and in March had a 38% profit margin on 90 Billion of revenue. 



Yet it seems the market isn’t interested in Google. It is by far the worst performing Mag 7 this year, down about 13%. So with so many strong growth segments and a healthy valuation, where is the skepticism coming from? 
Dibs on posting about how Google is undervalued tomorrow I swear it's either Google or UNH, these are the daily posts that people make lol Google is exact opposite of Tesla. The more you mention Google undervaluation on Reddit, the harder it falls 😂 I thought it was under valued at 188.. F 

guess I'm stuck on this train One of my largest holdings too. I have 1.3k GGLL and 210 GOOG.
Expecting the price to be $240 at least by the end of 2026.
Between search, Gemini, TPUs, Waymo, wingX, YouTube and cloud there are a lot of growth vectors for the company.

**Long term opinion:** I am of the opinion that anytime P/E ratios hit more than 20 for S & P 500, I know the long term returns start going down and with P/E close to 22 to 23.

**Positions:** I am sitting on 90% cash and using my 10% for day trading - Recent profits were all on INTC and TSLA. I always close EOD. I bought FSENX for 5% of my funds

**Thought:** I like looking at indirect impact points in addition to traditional technicals. Example - I keep an eye on are on Fedex/UPS earnings calls for retail forecasts (shipping volume directly proportional to sales numbers), banking earnings for understanding liquidity, credit availability, and investment returns etc. and not wait for formal readings like CPI etc to post.

**Target:** I have a SPY target of 550 to 600 for July 2026.

**Discussion points:**

* **Inflation** has not hit the economy yet, but this weeks earnings will start showing hints of it.
* Inflation if not controlled can impact **liquidity** (can impact 401k contributions, DCA contributions etc...)
* **War is never cheap** and thought it can give short term bursts of boosts to stock markets with rumors.
* **Debt** is good until it is within means - i.e. Debt < GDP
* **Risk fatigue is real** \- Your month on month contributions are being blindly invested in those target funds without risk readings taken into considerations and rug pulls are not uncommon.
* **AI bubble** is similar to the dot com bubble - those who know it, know it that dot com investments went beyond the realistic capabilities that were not realized until 10-15 years down the line but by then the bubble burst and took 10-12 years to recover.

I am not predicting a crash for tomorrow, but a crash or slow burn that will not bring any returns for next 12 months - though volatility both upwards and downwards will continue.

Whenever I see random words bolded I know it’s ChatGPT so im trying to understand your main point is that the market is too high rn and there will be a sharp pull back? I think you're way off on the core of your thesis. Namely about AI and inflation.

AI is not very similar to the dot com bubble IMO. And I expect deflation is actually more likely than inflation at this point considering consumer health, job markets, and the fact that the American consumer has a lot of room for changes in spending. People spend a lot more on non-essential goods than you think. Most of the lower and middle class have already started being more conservative.

Add to that deficit spending and money printing, I'm thinking we see corporate earnings strong, money printing and debt accumulation high, spending and employment weak. The most likely scenario to me in the short to medium term is that we continue to experience asset inflation while the economy overall looks weak. for once it's actually not AI yeah if you got in during april tariff dip, that was easily upwards of 20% returns already. I have heard people say this every year since I started investing in 2019. I view things more on a short term overbought/oversold basis than bull/bear cycle basis, and recent rallies have me feeling we’re getting overbought. 

The comment on debt being good until it is within means makes no sense.  Slop?

Re AI bubble, certainly there is some insane AI hype and marketing and valuation happening. Counterpoint is we will probably start hearing big corporate success story sound bites.  One such is today’s claim that Fedex freight robots have 2x throughput of human workers per hour.  True?  Twisted?  Cherry picked?  Don’t know and doesn’t really matter, AI market will like. Yeah, because those are all things we’ve never dealt with before.  None of that is black swan material dude. 

I don’t get why everyone keeps yelling AI bubble.  It’s practically brand new; it’s so early.  People act like these AI companies have been running up in price forever and there are thousands of them, smh. 

Lastly; there is not some rule about PE values other than ones arbitrary made.

1lih12j,2025-06-23,"Opportunities in the short-term market volatility? I'm sharing a low-risk offensive strategy that I've been tracking recently
Over the past few weeks, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have been fluctuating repeatedly at high levels. Many friends have said, ""The direction is unclear and we dare not act."" But in fact, the oscillation range is precisely when the low-risk strategy comes into play.

Recently, I have been tracking a simplified version of a strategy that combines range-bound oscillation and breakout following. The core logic is:

After determining the key support/resistance areas in major indices (such as $SPY / $QQQ) or large-cap stocks (such as $AAPL / $NVDA), observe the changes in trading volume and K-line structure.

Place an observation order near the upper edge of the range. Once the volume increases and breaks through, follow to open small positions. If there is a false breakout, the stop-loss is extremely small (usually less than 1%).

Auxiliary indicators use simple moving averages (such as EMA20, EMA50) + RSI divergence to determine whether the breakout is healthy.

Last week, I followed up with a small position using this framework when $NVDA broke through 1100, with a profit target in the 1150 range. The stop-loss is set below 1085, and the risk is very controllable.

I wouldn't say this is a ""sure-win strategy"", but its advantage lies in:

The risk is low, the cost of making mistakes is low, and it does not rely on prediction but only on market signals. It is suitable for volatile markets and the initial trend formation stage

Which stock/index breakthrough opportunities have you been observing recently? Let's all discuss our ideas together \~
So, ""just time the market, bro""

Ok, you do you.

I think I'll stick with dca:ing, thank you. Totally fair! DCA is a solid long-term approach , respect that.

What I shared is more for people who like adding a tactical layer on top of their core positions.

Always good to stick to what fits your risk tolerance and style. Why waste time with all this candlestick charting nonsense and just hit the easy button to go long volatility (and risk no capital) by selling costless collars...? It’s a smart move to keep cash and invest after a drop in price. Of course there is the risk that the market will just keep rising and not drop. But if the market drops then you’ll do much better than the blind dca buyers. Interesting setup — do you manually draw your levels or use an indicator? Always curious how others define their ranges. there are definitely many ways to approach the market.

1li6da0,2025-06-23,"Why EQT will benefit from AI, Iran War, and Trump Tariffs
EQT is the largest natural gas producer in the U.S.

Not going to bore you with financial metrics, so I will keep this thesis concise.

1. Natural gas is the primary marginal fuel for U.S. power generation, which will support AI datacenter expansion (not nuclear, at least this decade).
2. Roughly 20% of global LNG flows through the Strait of Hormuz. Any disruption could drive up global LNG prices, pulling more U.S. supply into export markets and tightening domestic balances - bullish for Henry Hub and EQT’s unhedged volumes.
3. Trump-era policy was broadly favorable to fossil fuels. While tariffs could pressure steel-intensive capex (e.g., pipelines), the trade-off is likely faster permitting, LNG approvals, and pro-drilling rhetoric.
4. EQT’s disciplined hedging strategy, strong capital return framework, and ongoing basis risk from pipeline constraints shape its risk/reward profile - limiting upside in price spikes, but providing stable cash flow and shareholder returns.

It's one of the best plays on U.S. gas demand growth, geopolitical optionality, and Trumpian regulatory shifts.

EQT is up 30% ytd / 60% 1-year and sitting at a 36B market cap.

There is a widespread banning on Instagram for CSE which is automated by AI. You can see it on r/Instagram too. Will this affect META stocks? I mean I like AI but it looks like it is halusinatic and bans people's accounts permanantly. (There were news that META is aware on the issue few weeks ago but it still continurs)

1lhydwg,2025-06-22,"Is now a good time to invest in UnitedHealth, or should we wait to see if the PR crisis goes deeper?
As we know, the UNH CEO was shot over exploitive business practices that hurt people and his profession/company.

In the wake of that, UNH has enacted a few transparency measures, and appointed a seemingly squeaky-clean CEO

The entire health insurance industry is seeing a wave in renewed skepticism that has resulted in UNH share price being nearly cut in half since the start of this controversy.

Should we buy now, or would it be wise to wait while the Luigi trial/internal investigations of the former CEO are still underway?
Their former CEO getting killed is not why the stock price plummeted.  I'd suggest doing more research if you're interested in buying stock. I’d say anything below $300 is a good price to dip your toes in. The current (also former) CEO bought 25 mil worth of shares at price of $288-ish. That’s a good indication of potential bottom. If it dips further, the dip will only be short lived. Not financial advice. https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/unitedhealth-lowers-annual-profit-forecast-higher-costs-2025-04-17/

This should get you started Their business plan worked for a long time.  But denying medical claims to make margins may not work very well in the future.  

I would at least wait until the trial is over and not in the news every night in a bad way. Well most of its growth is in Optum which was designed specifically to be unrelated to United Health Care. If you think that business is worthy then invest, if not then do not.

But as someone who lives in their HQ market, the sign seems to be the insurance wing is cutting costs and not hiring while Optum is doing capex and hiring growth. It has exited markets for the plans too instead of fighting with those states to stay there at or near current profits. I think it’s a company in transition. UNH is not going anywhere (I mean it’s not on the road to failure) You missed the bottom. Get in now I see this as rather temporary.

I work at a military-contracted company that has UNH as its policy provider. They also have 2 other big military contracted companies under their belt. These highly-subsidized industries keep them alive on their own, and they aren’t going anywhere as far as I’m concerned.

I’ve looked at the stock portfolios of several congressman, too, and there have been abundant share purchases in January. Their faith in it carries weight with me. Generational buying opportunity = only 10% upside? 

If it was a generational opportunity at $274 it’s still almost the same opportunity at $300 …  Think it’s gonna be a long road to recovery and you should be willing to hold shares for at least 1-2 yrs.

1lhs2k8,2025-06-22,"Predictable swing trade for NVDA?
I'm very new to investing, like in December will be 2 years. 

What I've been mostly doing is buying NVDA at 100 and below, then selling at 130 and above in chunks. I have never sold at the top price, but I have bought at the very bottom couple of times. And it's been quite profitable 

I've recently talked to experienced investors and they scolded me for swing trading, saying that timing the market is not a way to go and I just should hold the position for decades.

 I'm not arguing with their approach, they know better. But if someone could explain why swing trading is bad and what you are doing with nvda right now I'd be very grateful. I'm itching to sell at 140. 
Investing is different than trading, thats really the long and short of that. Trading means you sometimes miss out on long term gains, but it can also mean you aren't subject to short/long term drawbacks. >I'm not arguing with their approach, they know better. But if someone could explain why swing trading is bad and what you are doing with nvda right now I'd be very grateful. I'm itching to sell at 140.

I used to take a similar approach to you in the early to late 2000's.  I did it with the likes of NVDA AAPL MSFT AMZN ORCL GOOGL CRM ADBE to name a few.

I soon realized that I would have been far better off holding those stocks long term, and buying more over time, than I did by simply swing trading them.

What's the difference?  For every dollar that AAPL shares appreciated, holding the stock long term means I captured every single dollar of increase.  But buying in and out, I am only taking small cuts, and there were plenty of windows I missed out on.

I tried to buy those stocks on market dips, because I was confident they would recover in the long term, because they were great companies.  But great companies continue to increase in value over time.

In the late 2000's into the early 2010's, I started to buy, hold, reinvest all dividends, and my returns are far better.

Math says that if you timed every dip and every peak to perfection, you'd maximize your profits.  Math also says your odds of success in such a scheme is slim and none. I do the same and made decent profits.  Someone said it works until it doesn't, my solution to that is to hold it longer until it does work. You buy low enough it's going to bounce back. My version of swing trading in laymen terms is buying nvda at $100 selling at $143 then buying something else with the profits. I wouldn't call this ""timing the markets"" but simply buying at support and selling at resistance, then buying something else at support. Most of my money is always on the market. Because it works until it doesn’t.

The only way to consistently make money in the market is to either trade with some kind of inherent advantage or buy and hold.

I promise you don’t have any inherent advantage in trading NVDA. Essentially what you’ve been doing is flipping a coin and getting lucky for a stretch . Now you’re wondering why everyone doesn’t just flip coins until they become billionaires. Exactly this, I'm holding over 2800 shares of AVGO and it's always gone up, even when people were saying it's overvalued.
My goal is to hold 3000 shares by the end of the year and wait for it to make me a millionaire. It does, but if you buy at $100 -> sell at $130, and the price doesn’t dip under $130 again but you still view the stock as attractive, then you end up buying at $140 (for example) and sell at $160 (for example). This yields you $10 less, because it didn’t dip below the selling price.

You could also say that for the other way around, if you ddint buy -> sell -> re-buy at a lower price, you missed out on money as a long-term investor. Yes, but the difference between the two is that the long-term example is less volatile, and provides a greater sharpe for most. The risk-adjusted returns for trading unless you’re doing it professionally (not reading charts and speculating, but actualy quantitative work) is not worth it for retailers. no issue with what you are doing as you are subjecting more risk for greater rewards. it really depends on what your own goal and risk tolerance is. The math overall favors time in market for the average investor but swing trading is different from investing long term anyway. 

  
The biggest fallacy in your strategy is assuming that NVDA will go down to 100. You have been lucky to buy at the bottom a few times but you will inevitable miss days/week/months that does not touch a lower low. For example, if you did this in 2023, you would have lost out by a huge amount. You could do it in a kangaroo market like in 2025 though. Good strat given the current macro, tbh. It works until it doesn’t. The stock price may go outside the swing zone at some point, then either: 1. It skyrockets after you sell at current high and never come back, you miss the potential hugh gain. 2. It keeps dipping after you buy and never come back, or takes a long time, and you left holding the bag.

But I think this is manageable. For the former, just move on and find other trades, profit is profit after all. For the later, I think it's unlikely to happen for solid company like NVDA. So what I do is choose stocks that I feel comfortable holding long term, and do swing trading if got the chance. Once it doesn't work, either I move on, or left the fund there as long term investment. But I'm also new to investing/trading, and this kind of messing up the mindset between investing and trading, not sure whether it's a good thing...

1lhqsr1,2025-06-22,"Monthly income from taxable account?
I have a friend who just bought MSTY in his taxable account in order to generate monthly income. I know nothing about this strategy of investing. He is far from retirement but won’t listen to reason. He also invests long term and takes my advice there. 

Does he just uncheck reinvest dividends and then pull whatever is deposited into his core account into his checking except for what will be owed in taxes based on the short term capital gains rate he has? I told him to put 22% of what MSTY into SGOV or HYSA for taxes. 

Bonus question: What are some other ticker symbols he can use to generate monthly income? He wants some of his taxable portfolio to throw off extra money right now while he long term invests for retirement. 

Be gentle, I only know how to long term invest DCA style at all times and double DCA dips and HODL. He is hellbent in getting some extra money monthly. I mentioned OMAH, SPYI, QQQI, and BTCI but no idea if that was good advice. 
I would simply choose to not worry about my friend’s finances ""He is far from retirement but won’t listen to reason.""

Tell him he's an idiot and to hire a financial advisor then.

1lhog0g,2025-06-22,"What value is there in Waymo for Google
I'm having a hard time understanding this move, the taxi industry isn't really know for its margins, it seems like a lot of capital for a high volume low margin business that really doesn't seem that helpful to society either. It seems to me they were largely baited into this because of Tesla and North America has another excuse not to fund better public transit.

Whats your take
If you don’t have to pay humans the margins are better plus they can mass produce all the parts in factories which improves margins as it scales There's only so many ads they can shove in your face while you're commuting, unless they control the cars! 


I kid, but some truth, they wanted to diversify income because otherwise growth will hit a ceiling. Then, they can also sell and license their tech to every other vendor possible. My kid is 16. Neither she, nor the vast majority of her friends is desperate to drive. A ride service company is going to bank off of them if they can make it as easy to use as to buy their own vehicle.

I have no clue if it will be Waymo, but one of my smartest friends who has used them is convinced it is. That path (license/sell the tech to automakers) is what they’ve publicly stated as a goal in the past.

They don’t want to be an automaker. They want to be the system that powers autonomous driving for every other automaker.

*caveat: going off memory from months ago. If it’s changed as a stance, I’d love to see it Also, less time focused on driving means more time looking at screens. But also Google specializes in large algorithmic computing problems.  self-driving fits that description. 

Also, at scale, it could be cheaper to have self-driving cars than Uber, thus better margins. Maybe it means people in aggregate become less likely to buy cars and their budget has more money for ride sharing. 

Also, they can sell self driving tech to classic car companies, which I think is a major direction they’re going to take going forward.  I don’t blame them. Heck I’m in my 30s and I have no interest in driving. Grid lock traffic, wasted time, expensive. Shit sucks. It’s Waymo better Margins are huge when you’re the software provider for autonomous driving - which is ultimately the only piece of the business that Google wants to own in the long run. 

Not to mention the entire shift in the taxi economy that can happen when drivers aren’t needed. You can just non-stop blast ads in rider’s faces. You can lock features like heated seats behind paywalls or ads. 

It’s a massively untapped market for whoever truly figures it out first on a large scale #Maybe you didnt listen to Alphabet'a last earnnings call. Analyst asked this question. Sundar was elated and explained. Their plan is also to sell these cars down the line.

1lh3cl1,2025-06-21,"Allocating 20% of portfolio to QQQ LEAPS
My thesis is simple:

1. If you want to maximize your likelihood of optimal growth, you need to make high conviction bets - like 5-10 at most.
2. Allocate 80% of your portfolio to these high conviction plays.
3. Put the remainder 20% as a ""growth cushion"" like QQQ. Over a long-enough horizon, QQQ will beat SPY (basically saying tech drives growth).

QQQ is good, but why not use leverage to your advantage and do QQQ LEAPS instead?

Has anyone used a similar strategy or can you share how you would ""safely"" manage a QQQ LEAPS position on an ongoing basis?

Expiration, strike/delta, roll up/roll out mechanics would be awesome.
You might be asking in the wrong sub. Might want to check out r/options. 

In my opinion, LEAPS out 2 years, 80 delta, DITM helps balance risk/reward a bit. A recession or another liberation day might give you a big drawdown for a long time. 

I would roll mine out every 365 days to give myself a full 2 years at any time for a peace of mind. Every few years (e.g. 2022 at -32%) you will experience a negative return for the year so give it enough time to dig itself out. [deleted] At least wait 2 more weeks until we get past the Iran war decision deadline which also lines up with the unfreezing or dumbass’ tariffs. > Has anyone used a similar strategy 

Not me, but a lot of people in WSB have.

> ... or can you share how you would ""safely"" manage a QQQ LEAPS position on an ongoing basis?

Loaded question with no answer that uses logic and reason.

Questions for you:

1. How old are you?
2. On a scale 1 to 10, 1 being a WSB redditor and 10 being one of those top PhDs from a top B-School hired by Wall Street, how financially savvy/educated are you?
3. How big in $ is your portfolio?
4. How much $ are you going to add in the next 12 months?
3. What is the difference between:

1lgr7da,2025-06-21,"Could SunPower (SPWRQ) trading be re-enabled with it's bankrupt restricting/rebranding?
Title should say: ***bankruptcy restructuring***/rebranding

I, along with quite a few others, weren't paying day-to-day attention to the solar panel company SunPower when it filed for bankruptcy in August of last year, and weren't able to dump our SPWRQ stock before it flatlined: https://i.imgur.com/mx6KJ2J.png and became untrade in bokerages: https://i.imgur.com/ea4Z0VL.png since then

For whatever reason(s), I couldn't close the position and remove it from my portfolio, but I'll be the first to admit I know little to nothing about chapter 11 bankruptcy law and it's interaction with stock markets.

However, I just came across some news articles that after SunPower sold its assets to Complete Solaria, Complete Solaria is actually reviving and rebrand to the old SunPower name: https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2025/04/23/sunpower-rises-again/. Although the articles states ""The company’s ticker symbol will change from “CSLR” and “CSLRW” to “SPWR” and “SPWRW”, respectively, effective April 22, 2025"" the SPWR symbol still seems to be going: https://www.google.com/finance/quote/SPWR:NASDAQ

Also SunPower has regained Nasdaq compliance, reporting Q1 profits, being it's first profitable quarter in three years, and to returning solar panel and installation sales: https://www.pv-magazine.com/2025/05/06/sunpower-regains-nasdaq-compliance-reports-q1-profit/.

With this news, could Robinhood or other brokerages reactivate the SunPower trading? Once all the Nasdaq re-filling kinks are worked out. Those lingering $0.0001 shares look a bit out in my portfolio, lol.

I also found this trading symbol change notice in https://infomemo.theocc.com/infomemos?number=55054  that *""SunPower Corporation (SPWR) will change its trading symbol to SPWRQ effective August 16, 2024, dueto the listing of the company on an OTC market. As a result, option symbol SPWR will change to SPWRQ effective at the opening of business on August 16, 2024.""* Again, August 2024 has come and gone and the SPWRQ stock hasn't budged.

However, one redditor stated: ""Equity owners (shareholders) are typically wiped out in bankruptcies. All the asset sales are going to the creditors."" - https://www.reddit.com/r/SunPower/comments/1g6mo5r/what_to_do_with_sunpower_stock/lskcr2p/

Ok, fair enough, if it's gone, it's gone, built I would like to get some clarity what's going on, if possible. The fact that the ""new"" SPWRQ stock is still $0.0001 means Complete Solaria rebranding/takeover hasn't completed?

Thanks
From what I can tell (it's not entirely clear on the website/there's not a section of the website about this), SPWR declared bankruptcy and those shares are SPWRQ (Q = bankruptcy.)  The Sunpower assets were bought by Complete Solaria (CSLR) - which rebranded as Sunpower and whose shares became ""new"" SPWR. CSLR changed their name to sunpower on the stock market.  The new CEO was a sunpower founder years ago.  It remains to be seen if new SPWRQ ie complete solaria, can raise it's stock price.  So many USA solar installers have dubious business practices, that or consumers lack basic solar information, such as the daily solar energy in their location. Not clear AT ALL, lol. One quote was ""As a result, option symbol SPWR will change to SPWRQ"". ...SPWRQ is still a dead symbol everywhere afaik That's what I'm gathering. Thing is, the SPWRQ stock remains locked and untradeable by Robinhood. This is the first time one of my investments filled for chapter 11 bankruptcy. So I'm asking if the shares I own become tradable/valuable again after they full restore operations. At least until last week this new business could be traded on Merrill Edge.  Its interesting how platforms decide what stocks can be traded.  There are many others Merrill will not let me trade that robinhood does.  One of those etfs was EVAV a leveraged electric car fund.  I contacted Direxion about this merrill block last week, they emailed me back the usual suspect excuses or reasons, then they contacted merrill again, and as of 3 days ago it was trading again.

I’ve been waiting since April that TSLA will plunge or dead by now or at least below 200s. However, it’s so robust that it ain’t going down below 200.

1lg7ask,2025-06-20,"ELV vs UNH for long term hold
Hello, I'm wondering which stock would be better to hold 2 to 3 years minimum. Both of these stocks are being impacted by the current political climate but they should be able to weather it out by next year. So far from what I've read, ELV is better than UNH in terms of performance, but they're also more dependent on medicaid than UNH. Would ELV be impacted in the future heavily? Since UNH is down greatly that makes their stock a discount currently, so I would argue they have better potential for growth. However I'm unsure that's the only thing to drag it back up. I want to know which one would be better and if I should split my money between them. 
Long term for UNH. It ain’t going nowhere. It will be find for a long haul! It dropped from $600 to 250 and you think it has a ways to fall. I am waiting to buy UNH until after next quarter's earnings.

There were a number of lawsuits against UNH (as well as the execution of their designated lizard person) that caused them to tweak their automated claims denial system to actually pay people out their insurance claims for once.

I would guess that this wasn't fully accounted for in guidance.

this, along with the cost of the lawsuits, is why i am waiting until after they report earnings to buy in.  I think they still have a ways to fall. Yep.  UNH at $300 or below.
I am long. Got my 200 shares and writing covered calls. im not a trading professional.

My sense is simply that a bunch of the negative news they received that caused them to pay out claims happened after they already took a sharp drop.  

Their earnings should take a steep drop from last year as a result.  I don't know if that affects their price at all, since they already look like an attractive buy. Whatever problems they have today will go into their product pricing in future years. 

Their business model allows for pricing increases. The pent up demand for services from Covid era has been worked thru. The government will eventually likely go away.

Will take my chances on UNH now that price is cut in half. Not already priced in? Think it can go lower than TTM ATL? Selling put for 300. I absolutely don’t mind owning this stock tbh They've had some bad announcements since then that presumably aren't accounted for.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1lfriz4,2025-06-20,"Vi and AST SpaceMobile announce satellite connectivity partnership
Partnership Will Bring Direct-to-Device Satellite Broadband Connectivity to India, Supporting Digital India's Vision of Universal Mobile Access

MUMBAI, India and MIDLAND, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Vi (Vodafone Creative), India's leading telecom service provider, and AST SpaceMobile, Inc. ( ASTS ), today announced a strategic partnership to expand mobile connectivity in unconnected parts of India. is committed to building the first and only cellular broadband network in space that can be accessed directly from everyday smartphones and is designed for commercial and government applications.AST SpaceMobile has made history by making the first voice and video calls from space using a standard cell phone, a milestone that proves the real-world viability of its advanced technology.

AST SpaceMobile and Vodafone Idea announce satellite connectivity partnership in India

India is one of the largest and most dynamic telecom markets in the world with over 1.1 billion mobile subscribers. Despite the extensive coverage of 4G networks and emerging 5G networks, satellite communications will complement terrestrial connectivity to further extend broadband cellular access in some of the complex terrains where it is difficult to deploy terrestrial mobile infrastructure.

The partnership will combine Vi's robust national network with AST SpaceMobile's revolutionary space cellular technology, which connects directly to everyday smartphones without the need for any specialized software or device support or updates.

In line with the Digital India initiative, AST SpaceMobile and Vodafone Idea are collaborating to develop the SpaceMobile satellite system. This space-based cellular broadband ecosystem is designed to extend Vi's terrestrially-connected telecom services, providing voice, video, data streaming and Internet access. The project will cover the design, implementation and launch of the system, with AST SpaceMobile developing, manufacturing and managing the satellite constellation, while Vi will oversee terrestrial network integration, operational spectrum and market access.

Avneesh Khosla, Chief Marketing Officer, Vi, said, ""Vi has always been committed to connecting every Indian with technology and we see satellite communications as a complement to terrestrial connectivity. As satellite-based mobile access becomes a reality in India, we look forward to ushering in a new era of seamless and resilient connectivity.""

Chris Avery, Chief Commercial Officer, AST SpaceMobile, said: ""India, with its large and vibrant telecom market, is the ideal place to demonstrate how our space-based cellular broadband can seamlessly complement terrestrial networks. Not only are we expanding coverage, but we are also breaking down connectivity barriers and enabling everyday smartphones to access 4G and 5G networks directly from space. We are excited to join hands with Vodafone Idea to open up new possibilities for emergency response, disaster management, agriculture, distance learning and countless other applications that benefit from truly ubiquitous mobile broadband.""

The partnership will place India at the forefront of global innovation in space technology and will drive the development of connectivity use cases and [applications.Vi](http://applications.vi/) and AST SpaceMobile will also work together to develop commercial products for a variety of segments including consumer, enterprise and IoT.

I'm UK based and going to invest a small proportion of my portfolio in Nasdaq100 ETFs. Over the long term I think most advice is not to bother hedging as FX rates can vary over time, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. I was wondering however whether to invest 50/50 in hedged and unhedged funds to cover both bases and avoid any major fluctuations  i.e.

The unhedged fund has a TER of 0.2% and hedged is 0.35%. The year to date the hedged fund has performed significantly better presumably due to the weaker dollar:

1lfhex0,2025-06-19,"Google likely to face $4.7 billion USD fine
GOOG can't catch a break and likely to face fines in EU general court, however the penalty is not confirmed, only an advise by the Advocate General in EU court to dismiss Google's appeal against the fine that was proposed in 2022. This was the reason why goog took a dump before the market close on 18th June.

I am long goog, have $180C for August; hoping this is not a big dent. 

https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/business/money-report/google-looks-likely-to-lose-appeal-against-record-4-7-billion-eu-fine/3727955/
Slightly more than 4% of their revenue for a year. Before the 10-50x reduction when they settle. 

That'll show them. > GOOG can’t catch a break

Poor Google. Operating income of $112 billion last year, doubt this has a meaningful impact

Edit: net income of $100b Is there a gofundme to donate them? A 4% drop is very meaningful. It’s not going to destroy the company, but it will have an impact. It's actually just a smidge over 1% of their 2024 revenues. They did 350B last year, EU really hurting em bad with this one. That explains why it dropped almost 1.5% in 10 mins yesterday before close. Knew there had to be some news on that drop.

Now for the “it was actually priced in” comments and how wrong I am lol. Cost of doing business as a GOOG shareholder - i kinda love seeing fines.

1lfflkx,2025-06-19,"Is this the Tesla narrative, really?
Can someone help me make sense of this narrative for 100x potential that is keeping TSLA afloat?

Here’s a recap.

1. “Electric cars can be fast, cool & desirable” (2008-2012)
2. “Tesla is the Apple of autos” (2013-2019)
3. “Tesla is not a car company - it’s an AI, energy, and robotics platform.” (2020-2021)
4. “Tesla is building the future of AI & autonomy.” (2022-present)

Note that during these 4 periods, Tesla just made cars (with declining sales now) and never delivered on any form of full autonomy.

Am I missing something?
No. Just don't short it. they missed last quarter and squeezed up violently Tesla was a part of a larger, intricate financial market situation. 

It was heavily shorted in the early 2010s by the likes of Kynikos, Greenlight capital, Michael burry. hell, even Bill Gates had a large short position. 

The thesis was electric cars would not scale production as quickly as they did and would not be adopted. 

Tesla produced outstanding deliveries and numbers and combined with one of the greatest bull cycles, the shorts were forced to close. 

Tesla took advantage of this with convertible bond offerings and focusing on growth to match their valuation with growth multiples during the time. 

What you see with the stock is a slow squeeze of shorts playing out over a decade. 

That’s why you see 100%+ growth from Oct 2024 - Dec 2024. 

It doesn’t follow usual market conditions and logic because it’s been shorted so much leveraging derivatives that it’s still unwinding. 

The company is worth more than every other car manufacturer COMBINED. With DECLINING SALES. 

Horse shit of a stock imo at this price imo. But the bet isn’t TSLA, the bet is how much larger is a short position on it that can keep the stock running Tesla is best understood under the Greater Fool Principle, unless you somehow got in when it was trading sub 100. It follows no logic and is a bloodbath to trade, especially options or shorting. It’s a roulette wheel basically. Respectfully, why not? I’m long puts b/c they’re going to miss on deliveries this Q according to the data provider I pay for. Yeah. It’s tough. Probably a no touch scenario. Almost like a large amount of money is being used to fend off anyone with puts at reasonable points where puts make sense lol. Because when a lot of people short Tesla, the whales trade the opposite position, and then pump the price to make money.

You're basically trading the other half of what happened to GameStop, which would have likely gone to 0 had not so many people bet on it going to 0. Reasons why I haven't touched Tesla with either calls or puts lol. Anytime a stock reaches that level of meme status, it's impossible to predict.

Market very flat today Automod bot got rehired! 🥳 ""Markets are closed today"" apparently.

European and global markets *are* open today, and they're down roughly 1% (including our SPY equivalent ETF, VUAG)

Just in case y'all were curious Lol Trump will decide whether to intervene in Israel Iran war in 2 weeks. Apparently everything takes 2 weeks in Trump's brain although so far it is clear he doesn't know how long 2 weeks is. While it is obvious Powell screwed the pooch with his ""inflation is transitory"" catastrophe, he has my respect for coming back so strong with his, ""suck my d*ck, Mr. President,"" response to Trump's taunts. whoooosh WE ARE SO BACK....

1lertl9,2025-06-18,"MSFT may terminate expanded OpenAI deal as tensions rise over control and equity
According to the Financial Times Microsoft may terminate ongoing talks to deepen its partnership with OpenAI citing unresolved disputes over governance and future equity structure

The core issue OpenAI is pushing to formally transition into a for-profit entity which could potentially dilute Microsoft influence and ownership stake in the company  especially concerning any future models beyond GPT-4

Sources say that unless key terms are agreed upon Microsoft is ready to fall back on its existing commercial agreement which guarantees access to OpenAI models through 2030  unless a competitor matches or exceeds Microsoft's deal

Another twist OpenAI transition plan reportedly needs Microsoft formal approval by Dec 31, 2025. Without that green light OpenAI may risk losing interest from outside investors like SoftBank and other late-stage capital.

Despite the headlines, Microsoft commercial use case remains protected in the shorttomid term. But the question now is who controls the roadmap to GPT-5 and beyond  and whether Microsoft sees enough ROI to keep playing ball.

Is MSFT losing strategic leverage here? Or are they just protecting their current ROI？Could this open the door for Google, Amazon, or even Meta to get in bed with OpenAI?How would a fractured OpenAI impact Azure’s AI moat vs AWS and GCP?MSFT may terminate expanded OpenAI deal as tensions rise over control and equity


Yeah.. openai is now confident enough to secure more funding in absence of msft.. thats what i take from all this debate
Its hard to see msft let go of the profit after years of patience and investment in openai Why did this dump Amazon and Google at 3:50pm? 

Microsoft stock was completely unaffected. That exactly how I see it too  OpenAI signaling they don’t need MSFT anymore to raise capital is a major shift in tone. But yeah, hard to imagine MSFT just walking away after sinking billions and essentially bootstrapping OpenAI commercial model. OpenAI doesn’t have the legal team to handle Microsoft and Sam is going to distracted while they bury him in litigation, delays, stalls. Microsoft will use the next few years to extract all the value they need from OpenAI, fund competitors, then ditch them.

IF OpenAI can secure the funding to run at a loss for a few more years… and I do hope they survive. I use ChatGPT a lot.

It’s just much more efficient for MSFT to tank OpenAI if it doesn’t get the deal it wants and suck its assets like a vampire. Very classic Legacy Tech move What profit? They’re in a multi billion dollar hole. They burned billions. But still, 10B revenue after only being 2 years on the market is insane. Most products would never reach that in such a short time regardless of how many billions you threw at the project. My read is a little more nuanced. Microsoft has a lot of leverage now in that if it doesn't approve the change in corporate structure, then it will undoubtedly affect upcoming fundraising rounds, both in terms of scale and T&Cs (reportedly the equity already invested by third parties would be converted to debt).

Microsoft likely values the revenue stream more than the equity ownership of OpenAI (because who knows what it's worth) so I am sure they are pushing to keep certain rights to OpenAI's compute needs, but meanwhile OpenAI is trying to look after itself and diversify its cloud partnerships.

I'm sure they'll strike a deal but OpenAI will be under much more pressure than Microsoft to reach one promptly. Right  capital alone doesn’t get you product market fit The $10B number validates that they didn’t just build tech  they built something people were ready to pay for at scale. That kind of velocity is rare even in FAANG-tier launches. You're right that they're burning TONS of money. If I recall they made something like $11 billion in revenue and lost $10 billion in 2024, which is pretty bad. 

But lets be realistic, as long as people are willing to keep throwing money at them, they can still get a bunch of capital appreciation through an increase in the value of their equity. But of course raising money through issuing more equity will make that ROI lower then it would be if OpenAI didn't need to keep raising a ton of money. Because I work in tech as an engineer, and we’re being told day in and day out now we need to move faster “because we have AI” even though in our highly complex codebases it _is incapable of doing the simplest of tasks_ despite what you see on Twitter. 

It’s an excuse to get us to work longer hours for the same pay and lay off the people that refuse, and I’m tired of it.

1leow6r,2025-06-18,"UNH and Medicare/Medicaid Cuts
How impactful would the upcoming OBBBA be on UNH given that they would directly be effected by the spending cuts mentioned in the bill? News recently came out regarding UNH cutting commission on Medicare plans, but I don't think it's enough for it to be viable before the bill passes in a few weeks. Would it be better to buy UNH now or wait it out because I feel that it could definitely drop some more if more spending cuts are coming to medicare/medicaid.
And just get hallucinated at haha I think I answer this question almost every week, but don't invest in any healthcare company until after that bill pass. There are medicare cut, but the biggest problem is the Medicaid cuts which will cut off millions of people from health insurance and UNH is part of it. Medicaid also pay for the a lot of the healthcare services and the bill will bk many clinics and hospitals which will spike up the risk score and cost of healthcare. Any good news and this thing is going to fly. The risk is you wait too long and lose the good opportunity to buy low. After the bill so you know which direction it would be heading. After earning if your risk tolerance is low. I doubt there's any good news in the near future, especially with the cuts in minds and Q2 earnings being sub par, but there is a chance Q2 earnings pop off with the latin america sell off. Here's an idea. Why don't you load the text of OBBBA into AI and ask the question based on the contents of OBBBA? That will give you an answer quickly. I am curious to know too. So would u think buying after the bill is ideal or wait until Q2 earnings since that's a few weeks after the cut? I don't think this bill would affect them this soon but I'm unfamiliar with how quickly the bill would impact their next earnings. I see. As an investor of UNH, I would like to know its impact too. Well, I guess we just have to wait until they finalize the bill. Most likely whatever makes unh the most money will pass. 

As an investor great

As an American, fuck this shit Problem is senate is still revising and updating it so I'm not sure if it'll be as useful now since there could be more revisions in the coming weeks.

1lekpe1,2025-06-18,"Why large conflicts, economic changes are not impacting stock markets in last 2 months?
There is something called risk fatigue that has gone into the minds of investors in recent weeks who have become tolerant to large economic shocks (war, fed rates, politics, tariffs etc. ) and are still putting in liquidity that is available. This is also a record stock buyback period which has kept tech stocks stable. AI stocks are a no brainer for many and the second factor to keep tech stocks up and stable. 

The dollar degradation has also caused the USD value of a US traded stock remain stable as USD itself degrades in value. 

The P/E ratios for the broad market are stretched, and yet capital keeps flowing in due to FOMO. It's like standing on what feels like solid ground, but in reality, the sea floor is dropping and no one knows how far down it goes. 

Caution is needed, because the crash may not happen tomorrow, but there is a huge disconnect from fundamentals in this market. The reason bubbles burst and don't just deflate is because reality hits hard. 

  
SPY target for EOY 2026 - 580. 
What everyone forgets to look at in here is the USD devaluing against almost every other major currency. 

If you take that into consideration the market is still down around 10% this year. Can't say anything about the economy, but it's not reacting to the Iran/Israel war because oil is not reacting significantly to the Iran/Israel war. That's literally the only effect that matters. If oil doesn't care, why should SPX? If somebody is trying to tell you that Iran is important outside of maybe concern involving oil, then you need to ignore them.

Iran has turned out to be hilariously weak. Bc nothing ever happens. Companies are automating and making a killing. Go long & delete app It doesn’t necessarily have to be due to risk off factors. Big TACO wants weak dollar but considering he has absolutely no idea of basic economics there’s zero chance his foray into Advanced Dark Arts Level Economics ends in anything but the reverse of his goals Psst

A dollar countertrend rally is not putting clamps on the Nasdaq unless it's because of risk off, should it occur.

The USD up/US stocks under pressure tendency got messed up last year at about this time in the summer because of the Yen carry trade. This is my reply every time someone, left or right, mentions how well my stock portfolio is doing.

1leg1ix,2025-06-18,"Fed announces meeting to discuss easing capital rule, boosting banks' monetary power.
**Loosening of the supplementary leverage ratio would significantly increase the monetary power of banks.**

* US regulators are considering changes to a key capital rule for major banks
* The U.S. central bank announced the board meeting, scheduled for June 25, to discuss changes to the so-called ""supplementary leverage ratio,"" which requires banks to set aside capital against assets regardless of their risk.e Federal Reserve, FDIC, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are reviewing adjustments to the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio that applies to the largest U.S. banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley.
* Under the proposal, the capital requirement for bank holding companies could be reduced to a range of 3.5% to 4.5%, down from the current 5%. The banks' operating subsidiaries would likely see their requirements fall to the same range, compared to the existing 6%.
* Banks say the current requirements are excessive and poorly calibrated, and some of that cash could better serve the economy by being lent out.
* They point to how big banks weathered the COVID-19 pandemic and their role in stabilizing regional banks during turmoil in 2023 as proof that they are resilient and do not need to tolerate more onerous rules.
* Among the industry's goals are to lock in a much weaker version of the ""Basel Endgame"" capital rule[,](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/what-is-basel-iii-endgame-why-are-banks-worked-up-about-it-2023-07-24/) reduce a capital surcharge levied on global banks, re-work a key leverage constraint, and overhaul the Federal Reserve's annual ""stress tests"" which assess whether a bank could withstand an economic shock, said three executives with knowledge of the ambitious lobbying plan.
* If adopted, the changes would represent a significant loosening of post-2008 financial crisis rules designed to ensure banks can absorb losses and remain solvent during periods of market stress. 
“Look, we weathered Covid and only a few banks failed since then. Now that we know the current rules work for preventing massive failures in the banking system, why don’t we experiment a little? Turn down the rules, have some fun. Live a little and don’t be such a square. What’s the worst that could happen?”

- some Banking Lobbyist, probably So not only economic collapse but also free Americana banking feast for the worst class of parasites - the banking execs. Didn’t they just roll back restrictions in 2018 and have 3-4 banks fail a few years later? 
I’m not convinced that anything they do that involves deregulating banks if a good idea. 

We have already spent way too much money bailing them out. These corporations don’t need access to unlimited profits. We didn't learn a damn thing from '08 did we? Yup, happens every single time we let banks go u regulated. Those regulations were put in place after the 08 financial collapse, pulling them back was insanity Just another opportunity for JP Morgan to buy up a few more banks for the cheap. It’s their little loophole for banking monopolies. would this have any impact on interest rates? obviously the key components of the rate will be the fed funds rate combined with the 10 year treasury yields, but it seems reasonable to think that if banks can loan out more money, they could get more profit while charging lower rates due to being able to service more loans. we're not supposed to, they just learn how to screw us more I mean, It’s not like banks are sitting on half a trillion in losses on Treasuries… oh wait link?",79,0.91,44,0,Progress_8,stocks,['JPM'],fed announces meeting discuss easing capital rule boosting banks monetary power loosening supplementary leverage ratio would significantly increase monetary power banks us regulators considering changes key capital rule major banks us central bank announced board meeting scheduled june 25 discuss changes socalled supplementary leverage ratio requires banks set aside capital assets regardless riske federal reserve fdic office comptroller currency reviewing adjustments enhanced supplementary leverage ratio applies largest us banks including jpmorgan chase goldman sachs morgan stanley proposal capital requirement bank holding companies could reduced range 35 45 current 5 banks operating subsidiaries would likely see requirements fall range compared existing 6 banks say current requirements excessive poorly calibrated cash could better serve economy lent point big banks weathered covid19 pandemic role stabilizing regional banks turmoil 2023 proof resilient need tolerate onerous rules among industrys goals lock much weaker version basel endgame capital rule reduce capital surcharge levied global banks rework key leverage constraint overhaul federal reserves annual stress tests assess whether bank could withstand economic shock said three executives knowledge ambitious lobbying plan adopted changes would represent significant loosening post2008 financial crisis rules designed ensure banks absorb losses remain solvent periods market stress look weathered covid banks failed since know current rules work preventing massive failures banking system dont experiment little turn rules fun live little dont square whats worst could happen banking lobbyist probably economic collapse also free americana banking feast worst class parasites banking execs didnt roll back restrictions 2018 34 banks fail years later im convinced anything involves deregulating banks good idea already spent way much money bailing corporations dont need access unlimited profits didnt learn damn thing 08 yup happens every single time let banks go u regulated regulations put place 08 financial collapse pulling back insanity another opportunity jp morgan buy banks cheap little loophole banking monopolies would impact interest rates obviously key components rate fed funds rate combined 10 year treasury yields seems reasonable think banks loan money could get profit charging lower rates due able service loans supposed learn screw us mean like banks sitting half trillion losses treasuries oh wait link
1le2m3m,2025-06-17,"Apple is resilient, but stock buybacks are diverting capital from its moat
As a longtime Apple customer, I deeply understand its value proposition. However, management is facing a declining moat from the disruptive growth of artificial intelligence in the hardware space, which poses a price-return risk. Management would be wise at this point to focus less on stock buybacks and more on effectively investing cash flow into more aggressive M&A and better R&D talent. I predict Apple stock will return 10% annually over the next 12 months. I also predict Apple will return 10% annually over the next 10 years as well.

AAPL has been relatively weak so far in 2025. As of June 17, shares were trading at $195.64, down $2.83 intraday (-1.43%) Cumulatively, the year-to-date decline is about 20%, making it one of the worst-performing tech giants in MAG7

In the last month, the stock price has oscillated between $196 and $202 since the end of May, and is still below the key 50-day SMA of $205.69 and the 200-day SMA of $225.74, indicating that medium- to long-term downward pressure still exists.From a fundamental standpoint, Apple achieved revenue of $95.4 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, up 5% year-over-year Diluted earnings per share of $1.65, up 8% year-over-year, both of which exceeded Wall Street's expectations

The stock price is currently in the vicinity of 193 U.S. dollars has important support, if broken may further test the 180 U.S. dollars line, and above the key resistance in the 214-216 U.S. dollars range, once recovered will be expected to regain the momentum of the rebound if the AAPL fell to 193-190 U.S. dollars range,

can be considered to take a small position in the low batch of buying, using the average support area for short-term rebound arbitrage. If AAPL falls to $193-190, you can consider taking small positions to buy in low batches and take advantage of the SMA support area for short-term rebound arbitrage. If the price can recover $205-206 and stabilize above it, it can open up space for a larger rally.
A stock buyback to me was as clear a tell as you can get that it’s hit “mature company trading as a growth company” with current volumes. Another useless post. 

What makes you think it’ll return 10% per year for the next 10 years? Did you just pull that number out of thin air? Where are your estimates for revenues and profit margins per line of business? 

It’s all just guessing – and then you have the temerity to suggest how and when to take positions! An absurdly hollow post. If advertisement really is important, they need to fire whoever is leading their ad campaigns,  the condescending ai and Mac commercials just make no sense to me. Apple started aggressively buying back its stock about 12 years ago. It is up over 1000% since then Fr. Apple used to have iconic ads. They need to get back to it. Have some creative fire I sometimes wonder what people expect from Apple? If innovation is so easy list the ideas you have for Apple? More than Apple, I can count on Taco King and his Congress to inflate the money supply 10% per year. 

That means number go up even though companies go on cruise mode doing buy backs. 

The dollar will get juiced up. That has a muuuch higher probability. 

S&P close to 10,000 but dollar in dumps. New iphones (16) have been selling at a discount in China since day 1, and currently are being sold at a 30%+ discount, while the new iphone 17 will be basically the same phone as the 15, just a bit uglier IMO. That should tell you enough about where the business is heading. I don’t need to Google because I am Chinese and have brought several Apple product using the exact subsidy provided by both the shopping platform and the Chinese government. 

And you don’t use Google in China. So here is an actual link in Chinese on how you can go about getting these subsidize. 

https://www.zaobao.com.sg/realtime/china/story20250122-5772544

Btw consumer spending is literally the explicit goal as stated by the CCP as China IS in deflation

The same subsidy is not available in Hong Kong or Macau which btw is also part of China but with a completely different financial policies. If u want to take advantage of these subsidize you have to 北上to purchase from these specific platform (JD and Baba mostly） and have it ship to a mainland address.

If you want to take away anything from this. These subsidies applies to ALL consumer electronic and the majority of these are spend on Apple product as it make them literally the cheapest around the world. So the takeaway is actually the opposite of what you are trying to imply. 

As for Huawei. Here a Chinese perspective. People buy it for national pride and it’s actually not that much cheaper than iPhone. Everyone in China that are not allow to use an iPhone has an Huawei during work and an iPhone for leisure purpose. 

Outside of work restriction whether someone has an iPhone or not is entirely due to preference and frankly personal economic condition. It was a sarcastic joke on the average Apple hater claiming that Apple never does anything new and everything is shit since Steve died and it's a company that runs entirely on grinding the iPhone profits and buybacks.

Completely ignoring that Apple created two new subdivisions of products and now owns the global market for both products within a period of 10 years. Like that's something you just do as a company. 

And when they actually engage in trailblazing new technology (Apple Vision Pro) they get hammered anyway.  We'll slowly see lessons from that experiment enter other wearable technology.

1le0uqf,2025-06-17,"Microsoft & AMD team up on next gen Xbox chips  what does this mean for Nvidia and Sony?
Big news just dropped  Microsoft and AMD just announced a multi-year partnership to develop custom chips for the next wave of Xbox console  from in-home to handhelds

This comes right after Microsoft showed off their new handhelds (Xbox Ally and Ally X) with ASUS. Seems like they’re going all-in on mobile gaming and cloud-based access. Sarah Bond even mentioned AI-enhanced visuals and full backward compatibility

AMD already has deep ties with both Xbox and PlayStation. But now with this new exclusive push, is Microsoft trying to build an ecosystem like Apple  where hardware, software  and cloud all sync seamlessly?

Also how does this play out for Nvidia, who powers Nintendo's Switch line? And what’s Sony’s move here, especially after letting Xbox publish games on PlayStation?

Game Pass is already pulling in strong growth and Xbox’s segment posted $13B+ last quarter. If Microsoft nails the hardware side too is this where the next leg of growth comes from?
AMD has already been contracted by Sony to design the chips for the next Playstation.  AMD designed the last 2 generations of gaming consoles for both Sony and Microsoft, so these partnerships are not new. Wasn't AMD always supplying Xbox CPUs? AMD has made the chipset for the last two generations of Xbox and PlayStation consoles.

Backwards compatibility is insanely valuable on consoles, as it's a massive incentive for gamers to buy the next generation of the same console.

Everyone pretty much assumed that Sony & Microsoft would continue using AMD designs until there was an extremely good reason not to. So all this news really does is confirm that Microsoft is indeed going to make another Xbox console, which was unclear for a bit. Nvidia is like 1% retail so nothing is gonna come from this,

Nvidia didn't even do much for the consoles anyways Yup, and they're also in the Series X and Series S — custom Zen 2/RDNA 2 chips, if I remember right. this isn’t about AMD at all. they’ve always used AMD chips. sony will use AMD chips for the next playstation 

this is microsoft’s way of quelling rumors that they’re getting out of the console business (while simultaneously confirming that they’re going to make bigger bets on handhelds) It means status quo. Yep and they are likely already priced in. If the partnerships wouldn‘t be there then the stock would probably drop like a rock.

1ldz9um,2025-06-17,"Hims & Hers is an excellent subscription telehealth business
IMS started as a site for cheap Viagra, and in 5-6 years has morphed into several segments for men and women, including Sexual Health, Obesity, Dermatology, mental health, and plans to launch Testosterone and menopause this year. I own Hims & Hers (HIMS) and believe it's an excellent long-term growth story for the following reasons

* It offers a high-growth, recurring subscription telehealth business with strong user and revenue growth, expanding into multiple health segments.
* The trend among millennials and Gen Z patients towards digital health should ensure Hims sustaining its pole position.
* Untapped potential as the market leader in platforms for patient care and medicine for the younger cohort.
* A strong, growing subscriber base, with over 85% retention.
* A subscription business that will always get more profitable with even more scale, as HIMS has demonstrated in the last few years.
* I believe it has the first mover advantage in a trending business of digital healthcare as a service. Even with Amazon in the mix.
* The strong cash flow generation is allowing HIMS to expand and integrate diagnostics, add more specialties such as hormonal therapies, and increase fulfillment, without borrowing or dilution.
Expensive, good business model though. Do you have a long position? What's your bear case? you realize their products are 10x the price of any other source you could get it from, even digital services like GoodRX I just don't see why people need it...there are better ways to get whatever inexpensive pills will help you. what do you think of novo nordisck at this price and whats your though on hims now post break up? From all the ads on Reddit, I’ve come to the conclusion that for some reason some of their treatments for baldness include finasteride. In my view, that’s a bad move that’s a sentinel sign for the judgement they exercise so I’m staying well away from their ads and the stock. Yes, I do, and they have challenges and weaknesses for sure -  a) the stock is expensive, b) there could be cases of overprescription, which may lead to oversight c) they need to improve margins. I just bought some Novo Nordisk this morning. I think it was dumb on both sides. Clearly, both need each other; instead, they're wrangling over something that could have been amicably sorted. I may add HIMS, but I will be surprised if there is no class action suit from shareholders. Amazon has been there for a while, and HIMS survived and did well. Another interesting positive, Novo Nordisk partners with them for selling obesity meds. They have 2.6Mn subscribers - that's the big deal, and 1.3Mn in an acquisition in Europe, going on right now. What about losing that exemption so they can make custom glp1s or whatever?

You don't foresee any risk in owning a stock dependent on oil and gas?

What's your thesis? All O&G trade for close to 15x earnings, so there's nothing special here.

They grew 2% last quarter, what growth? Based on their numbers and no knowledge of the company, I don't hate them. And that's a compliment. This looks more like a swing trader \> This company would track closely with any other oil company, I don't see it as a bigger risk than anyone else.

And every other O&G trades for around 15-20x earnings. There are a lot of stocks that don't have the risk of significant earnings loss due to change in O&G over the next decade. You don't foresee any climate, energy related issues hitting the industry? They aren't diversified. There's plenty of other stocks without these risks trading for these earnings. 

\> Last several years they have had good growth

Investing is not about paying for the last several years growth, it's about paying for future growth.

Try creating a thesis that is at least a paragraph long if you want people to engage with it and take it seriously. Read some analysis at SeekingAlpha if you want a baseline of what an amateur stock thesis looks like. How so?  This company would track closely with any other oil company, I don't see it as a bigger risk than anyone else.

1ldvwbd,2025-06-17,"Meta to release smart glasses with Oakley and Prada, extending Luxottica partnership
Meta and EssilorLuxottica plan to release versions of their AI-powered smart glasses under the Oakley and Prada brands, CNBC has learned.

The addition of Prada and Oakley underscore the breakout success Meta had with its second-generation Ray-Ban glasses released in partnership with Luxottica in 2023. The Oakley expansion will be done in partnership with Luxottica, while the addition of Prada signifies Meta’s first step toward bring its wearable hardware to more fashion companies. 

Meta on Monday teased the Oakley release on social media, launching an Instagram account for “Oakley | Meta” with a profile description that reads “The next evolution is coming on June 20.”

CNBC reviewed a document that says the new glasses with Luxottica will be aimed at athletes. Meta is targeting active consumers after seeing several owners of its Ray-Ban glasses use the device to record themselves playing tennis, skiing and doing other activities.

The Oakley version of the glasses may cost around $360 as they are more weather resistant than their Ray-Ban counterparts, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly about the upcoming device. The first version of the Oakley Meta glasses will feature similar technology to the Ray-Ban Meta glasses released in 2023.

Luxottica, based in France and Italy, has licensing arrangements with over 150 brands and owns notable brands including Ray-Ban, Oakley, Vogue Eyewear and Persol.

Meta’s agreement with Prada comes after the fashion company in December renewed an eyewear-related licensing agreement with Luxottica for 10 years. That deals covers the “development, production and worldwide distribution of eyewear under the Prada, Prada Linea Rossa and Miu Miu brands,” the companies said at the time.

Besides giving Meta a high-end partnership, the Prada glasses may be a particularly good fit for the tech company as many of the brand’s models come with thick temples, former Meta employees said. That provides more heft for housing many of the components necessary for smart glasses, including microphones and chips.

It’s unclear when the Prada deal and product line will be announced.

Meta first partnered with EssilorLuxottica in 2019 to jointly develop the Ray-Ban glasses. The two companies released the first version in 2021, but they found success after the release of the second-generation Ray-Ban Meta glasses in 2023. That version comes equipped with the Meta AI voice assistant and includes features and, when tethered to a smartphone, lets users identify city landmarks, get recipes when looking at ingredients and record and send voice messages on WhatsApp and Messenger.

EssilorLuxottica CEO Francesco Milleri said in February the companies have sold 2 million pairs of the Meta Ray-Ban glasses since 2023. Miller said he aimed to increase annual production to 10 million units by the end of 2026.

Meta and Luxottica announced an extension of their partnership in October, with plans to release more versions of their Ray-Ban glasses. That deal was worth $5 billion, according to a July 2024 report in The Wall Street Journal. As part of the deal, Meta gets exclusive rights to Luxottica’s brands for its smart glasses technology for a number of years, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC. 

The two companies plan to release a bulkier, third generation of their glasses in time for the coming holiday season. The new device is expected to include a small display in one of the lenses, CNBC has previously reported.

Competition in the market is heating up.

Last month, Alphabet announced a $150 million partnership with Warby Parker that will see the two companies team up to release glasses infused with Google’s Gemini AI assistant. The companies plan to release the glasses sometime after 2025. 

Snap, meanwhile, announced in June that it plans to release its sixth generation smart glasses under a new brand called Specs. Those glasses, expected for release in 2026, will include augmented-reality technology and will be smaller and lighter than Snap’s prior products, Snap said. 

Meta declined to comment. Luxottica and Prada could not be reached.

Bloomberg News first reported about the Oakley Meta glasses in January.

Who buys this crap? And once again the reddit comments prove that the sample subset is not reflective of consumer sentiments. The glasses have been pretty successful so im not surprised. Im pretty excited to see the additions meta will bring to go up against Google's glasses that were announced recently

Now they make more money than most S&P500 companies. Yeah hold on guys I have to let these ads play before I can look at the sunset Tiktok pranksters rejoicing at this news They've sold 2 million of the Ray Ban glasses so far. Me, it is one of my best tech buys over the last few years. I dont care about the ai features but particularly with having a baby it is so amazing. Instant photos capturing so many amazing memories without needing to use my hands and the earphones allow me to keep track of the surroundings. Can also use prescription glasses, and they actually also look great. Great buy. Can't wait till my phones are left unpatched for a few years as they are abandoned by version 2.0, and then I get to run a botnet on my fucking sunglasses. Sega sold 9.1 million Dreamcasts in 2 years when there were 2 billion fewer people on earth and far fewer of them able to afford luxury goods. The Dreamcast was considered a failure.

The glasses might be successful eventually. But 2 million is not exactly an impressive number. I actually own a pair. I talk on the phone for 4+ hours a day for my job and like the speakers and mic better than my airpods. I also like it when I’m jogging in the city, doesn’t block my hearing like airpods do.

Reuters reports that President Trump abruptly left the G7 summit after blasting the EU for not offering a “fair deal” and calling Japan “tough” in stalled talks He’s also floating new pharmaceutical and energy tariffs to boost domestic production   
  
Tariff Risk: Trump's comments suggest he could unilaterally impose tariffs or expand tariffs on EU auto and pharmaceutical imports, and possibly even impose more tariffs - a move that has historically devastated related stock groups  
  
Sector exposure: Watch autos (GM, F, TSLA), large-cap pharma (PFE, MRK) and industrials (CAT, GE) for increased volatility  
  
Market sentiment: Despite Middle East tensions, major indices barely flinched on Monday, but a fresh bout of trade uncertainty could undermine recent gains  

He is gonna take the US to war. We all knew it. He is doing a shit job, everything he touches is failing now he is gonna try to fix it with the fog of war. When THE US Congress, famously known for doing Jack shit all day, is doing work to try preemptively restrict the POTUS ability to drag the US into a war.


You know it's getting spicy. It's a *bipartisan* sentiment. Hell, even Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon are telling Trump NOT to get into Israel's wars(s) because Israel has attacked 5 different countries in just the past 18 months. **Occupied Palestinian territory, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, and now Iran.** Oh no, they called me taco.. This isn’t news. He said what he wanted and left. He is now trying to start a war with Iran and pass his big awesome bill or whatever. He shouldn’t be at the G7. There's been 1 trade deal completed and it's June 17. G7 has nothing so do with anything that will happen going forward.

Wait until he goes unhinged again in a couple weeks. TACO Tuesday Well, he’s now openly talking about assassinating another countries leader, so who knows what happens next Trump really treating the G7 like it’s a Monday morning boardroom firing. The man dips early, threatens tariffs like it’s 2018 again, and somehow the markets barely blink. But if he slaps pharma or EU autos with new tariffs, that chill in investor confidence might start showing up real fast. Keep your popcorn ready and your stop losses tighter. But he said he wasn’t going to do it on the campaign trail!!

Solar stocks such as Sunrun (RUN), SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) and First Solar (FSLR) plunged overnight after the newly released Senate budget bill would keep a full phase-out of solar and wind energy tax credits by 2028.

The GOP-led Senate Finance Committee late Monday unveiled changes to the Trump budget bill that passed the House, but left the wind-down of solar and wind incentives.

Sunrun stock dived 35.4% early Tuesday, with SolarEdge down 30.3%, Enphase Energy (ENPH) 19.9% and First Solar stock 16.3%. Array Technologies (ARRY) gave up 13.7%, Shoals Technologies (SHLS) 10.1% and Nextracker (NXT) 13.8%. Nextera Energy (NEE) lost 2.8%.

A decline in solar and wind projects could affect demand for battery storage. But Fluence Energy (FLNC) rose 3.%.

Tesla (TSLA) has a notable storage business under Tesla Energy while the Senate bill would end the $7,500 tax credit for EVs 180 days after becoming law. That's vs. the House's end-of-2025 cut-off. Tesla stock dipped 0.6% in premarket action.
I thought it the Rs liked American manufacturing?? Master class in how to destroy good American jobs. What manufacturing do they even want? They refuse to build infrastructure so that makes it hard for a lot of specialized industries. They hate wind/solar. They keep picking winners simply based on who they like.


Besides sweatshops what exactly are they doing to promote real manufacturing in the USA? They want coal fired AI data centers. Not even joking. It’s funny without Subsidies shale oil wouldn’t have  got off the ground Everyone likes to ignore just how heavily subsidized oil and gas still are today.

Billions and billions and billions and trillions and billions.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Good luck to this economy when J Powell leaves at the end of his term.

What a balanced Fed Chair we have right now. My gut is at 80%+ chance that US airstrikes begin in the next 36 hours. Market reaction on Monday in both crude and S&P 500 was off base. Israel did all the hard initial work and now US bombers can fly in with ease and at a level of scale Israel lacks.

All the Presidential staff are doing their usual glazing, even the UK / Germany are expressing public support; naval assets steaming toward the region (including all ships at Bahrain port); mass movement of aerial tankers; unhinged surrender Tweets; Trump disregarding DNI claims of 'years away'; Mike Huckabee channeling his religious fanaticism; publicly attacking Tucker Carlson.

 Literally every headline is spelling it out for you. Trump wants to be seen as powerful and what better way than to annihilate an already disintegrating regime after the skies have cleared? I’m not saying we will see a major correction soon, but I guarantee if we do so many people here will be screaming about how it’s all rigged and the rug was pulled out and no one could have seen it coming Surely someone here has been accidentally added to the Signal chat? It would be good to know what Trump's top team of morons are talking about. The subred bot must have gotten laid off, that's why no thread was created today. 🥲 Google Waymo looking to expand to NYC.

Google red, Tesla +3%. Publicity seeking President Emmanuel Macron, of France, mistakenly said that I left the G7 Summit, in Canada, to go back to D.C. to work on a “cease fire” between Israel and Iran. Wrong! He has no idea why I am now on my way to Washington, but it certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire. Much bigger than that. Whether purposely or not, Emmanuel always gets it wrong. Stay Tuned!

1ld7knp,2025-06-16,"Is UNH a good buy in the current price or is there potential for it to dip again?
I have been reading articles that keep mentioning the same thing - that although United Healthcare has been facing some short term scrutiny it's a good idea to buy now since there is a lot of upside in the long run. Since I plan to hold it for at least 2 or 3 years (assuming it reaches 600 by then) I was wondering if it would be a good idea to buy now or wait until Q2 which may or may not impact the stock even more significantly. I want to invest enough to hold 100 shares, so I am hoping for the best price. I just want want some clarification on the future outlook of the company.
Part of me thinks this will play out like Equifax. They’re just too big and despite all the shit going on and the terrible press it’s not like people can really switch their health insurance similar to how all the banks and creditors weren’t going to drop equifax.  It's a good buy and it can drop 5-10% anytime If you follow the investing habits of those in our gov who are writing the laws in relation to this, they are investing in UNH. Must be nice to write legislation exempting yourself from insider trading laws Buy - but only buy stocks. It wouldn't surprise me if it stayed flat as a pancake for 2 years The rise and the fall was all Covid related though. UNH is massively diversified I’d say it’s a good buy just me tho Actually in America there is huge healthcare churn. About 20% of the population switches their health insurance every year. Just listened to a podcast about it the other day lol 

Also they’re likely not going to get away with scamming people and denying all claims as much anymore More upside potential than downside risk. It’s a safe long term investment imo.

President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Monday that they are signing a trade deal that will slash tariffs on goods from both countries.

The deal does not include tariffs on steel, an especially important piece of bilateral trade. Instead, talks are still going on about whether steel tariffs will be cut to zero as planned in the provisional agreement.

Trump and Starmer announced in May they’d struck an agreement that would slash U.S. import taxes on British cars, steel and aluminum in return for greater access to the British market for U.S. products including beef and ethanol.

But it did not immediately take effect, leaving British businesses uncertain about whether the U.K. could be exposed to any surprise hikes from Trump.

British businesses, and the U.K. government, were blindsided earlier this month when Trump doubled metals tariffs on countries around the world to 50%. He later clarified the level would remain at 25% for the U.K.

Starmer said Monday that the trade agreement is “in the final stages now of implementation, and I expect that to be completed very soon.”

Trump said the deal is “gonna produce a lot of jobs, a lot of income.”
We have a trade deal with the UK!

great, 89 more countries to go…

We have another trade deal with the UK!

Okay. Great. Still 89 more countries to go… I thought they held a meeting at the Oval Office over a month ago saying they had a trade deal?

So what was that meeting then? [deleted] Didn't they have a deal like a month or two ago? concepts of a deal hoping theyre able to reach a consensus with the UK next TL;DR Americans will be paying more for items from the UK. Watch, they'll sign a deal, then a month later the UK will do something Trump doesn't like and he'll slap tariffs on them that go directly against the deal they just signed. 

Which is why it's utterly pointless negotiating with this guy. Any leader who thinks he'll hold to any deal he makes with them should be removed from office for being stupid. It was announced, but can we trust any announcement from this administration at this point? They’ll probably have another “deal” cemented next month.

1ld4a39,2025-06-16,"AMD Soars 10% as Piper Sandler Raises Price Target After 'Advancing AI' Event
No paywall: https://www.investopedia.com/amd-stock-soars-as-piper-sandler-raises-price-target-after-advancing-ai-event-11755402

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares popped nearly 10% to lead S&P 500 gainers Monday as Piper Sandler analysts raised their price target for the stock coming out of the chipmaker's ""Advancing AI"" event. 

Piper raised its target to $140 from $125 and maintained an ""overweight"" rating for AMD stock. Shares of AMD were at about $127 in recent trading, making Piper's target a roughly 10% premium. 

The analysts came away ""enthused"" by the firm's newly unveiled Helios server rack architecture, which it called ""pivotal"" for the growth of AMD Instinct GPUs. Helios will combine next-generation AMD MI400 chips into one larger system, the company said, and is expected in 2026. 

AMD highlighted its partnerships with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Meta Platforms (META), Oracle (ORCL), Microsoft (MSFT), and others at the event. Bank of America analysts believe there’s another high-profile partner announcement to come: Amazon (AMZN).

Amazon Web Services (AWS) was ""a key sponsor for the event,"" BofA said. However, AWS typically uses its own events to announce new engagements, making a future reveal likely, the bank added.

BofA maintained a ""buy"" rating and price target of $130 following the event. For comparison, the analyst consensus price target from Visible Alpha is about $124.
Down 30% next week Very excited for this stock. If the next AMD chip is good at inference and inference becomes the next big thing for agentic AI, they’re set for really good growth. Advanced Money Destroyer seeking new victims It’s different this time (unironically). AMD is years behind NVDA, yes. They weren’t ready a year or two ago for AI like NVDA was. But now with MI350 this year and MI400 next year, combining with an evolving software stack and big partners like OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft etc, the next earning numbers are gonna boom. AMD is only 200B market cap. If they capture even a fraction of the data center market (which they will given the specs and prices on these new chips), the market cap expansion can grow a lot march 8th 2024 I know what some of those words mean! That makes me excited! It's gonna be different this time!! 😔 Advanced money destroyer? Basically the stock got a little too overhyped when nvidia jumped and became massively overbought. It experienced an entire year of non-stop daily drops as the AI was overpriced. It bottomed a few months ago & has been nothing but up since! The AMD P/E ratio isn't really accurate, its messed up because of the way the Xilinx acquisition was done. Its going to fall off the next few years.

1lczq0j,2025-06-16,"Convince me not to go deep into SNAP
Believing the future is wearables AR and will replace phones. Is there a better positioned company that still has massive 100x potential than SNAP?

Snapchat leads in social AR, engaging 850 million monthly users, primarily Gen Z and Millennials. Its AR Lenses, used by 250 million daily, offer 600,000+ filters via Lens Studio, outpacing competitors in creative, social-focused AR. Snapchat’s Stories, disappearing in 24 hours, drive authentic, pressure-free sharing. Features like Snap Maps and Bitmoji games enhance user interaction. Snap’s Specs, set for a 2026 launch, aim for lightweight, standalone AR glasses, leveraging $3 billion in AR investment. Despite $4.6 billion revenue and $1.3 billion net loss, Snap’s first-mover edge over Meta’s 2027 AR glasses positions it to lead the mobile-to-wearables shift.

Boss, how long have they been in business? How long have they been unprofitable? Tell me about their share dilution. [removed] I know 0 people that still use snapchat daily Is it 2013? When snap was actually popular? AR glasses will be a gimmick for the average consumer like 3D TVs.

1lcshjd,2025-06-16,"WhatsApp to Show Ads, Offer Paid Subscriptions for First Time
Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. will begin showing ads inside of its WhatsApp messaging service, opening a new potential revenue stream while the company invests heavily in artificial intelligence and other long-term projects. 

The ads will appear in WhatsApp’s “Updates” tab, a section of the app that’s separate from a user’s inbox and private conversations. The tab gets 1.5 billion visitors per day, Meta said Monday. That tab is home to Status, WhatsApp’s version of disappearing Stories, which will now carry ads.

Advertisers can also pay to promote their WhatsApp Channel and give it prominent placement within the Updates tab. Channels allow brands or celebrities to post to a group of followers, like a giant email blast. 

As part of the advertising push, WhatsApp will also let Channel operators sell subscriptions, meaning they can create special messages just for a group of paying customers. Meta won’t take a cut of any subscriptions sold through the app at launch, but eventually plans to charge 10% of sales, Alice Newton Rex, vice president of product at WhatsApp, said in an interview. 

Meta has been spending aggressively this year on AI, including to improve the large language models that underpin generative AI features in its products. The company also just agreed to invest $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in Scale AI, an AI data labeling startup, according to a person familiar with the deal. The expense has added pressure on Meta’s main advertising business to continue growing to support the expanding AI effort. 

The company has spent years slowly developing a business to accompany the private messaging service acquired for $19 billion in 2014. Advertising has never been considered a great fit given the intimacy of a private messaging inbox. Meta instead built WhatsApp to cater to small businesses, including efforts to build out digital payments and shopping features. Those services have been targeted especially in countries outside the US, such as India and Brazil, where the WhatsApp is the dominant messaging app. 

While payments, in particular, has been a slow moving effort given various regulatory concerns, Meta makes billions of dollars each year selling click-to-message ads on Instagram and Facebook that send users to a WhatsApp chat conversation with the advertiser. It also allows businesses to pay to reach customers on the app who have opted to receive their direct messages. 

Part of Meta’s challenge historically has been balancing the desire to generate revenue with a desire to give WhatsApp users privacy. Meta’s other advertising products are hyper-targeted and often rely on a user’s personal information or browsing history. WhatsApp messages are end-to-end encrypted, and user privacy was a major promise from co-founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton, who pledged they would never sell ads inside WhatsApp. They left Meta in 2018 and 2017, respectively.

WhatsApp ads will use broad, general targeting like a user’s location, language preferences, and Channels that they follow, Newton Rex said. Meta won’t take a person’s Facebook or Instagram information to target them with ads on WhatsApp unless they’ve explicitly linked their accounts, she added. 

“We’re not going to interrupt people’s personal messages with ads,” Newton Rex said. “If you just want to carry on using WhatsApp for messaging and calling then you’ll never see them at all.”

WhatsApp will begin a global rollout of ads beginning Monday, but it will take time for all users to start seeing them, she added. 
I hope Zuck will be forced to watch ads all day in hell They do realize the amount of people that use it because it is free and non intrusive right? Finally, a tangible reason to get my friends and family to switch to Signal. Thanks zuck! Messaging portion won't have ads, which is what most people are probably using it for. Pretty sure I paid 99p 10 years ago. That should have covered me for life This is huge, WhatsApp is not really used in the US from what I understand but it’s immense in Europe where I am from, it’s going to be another huge revenue stream for Meta, extremely bullish 

(also fml ads are going to pollute my messaging app now too, that’s just great) Hahaha! In the Metahell What's the point of offering a free app for any company?

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [Israel Iran Missile Attacks Nuclear News 06 16 2025 ](https://apnews.com/article/israel-iran-missile-attacks-nuclear-news-06-16-2025-c98074e62ce5afd4c3f6d33edaffa069)

[**ORCL (Oracle)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ORCL&p=d)\-Had a massive run after earnings, going from 170 -> 220. Mainly interested on the short side of this due to the Iran/Israel conflict and oil surging and affecting all stocks on the market. Was interested in a short on the overnight exchanges yesterday. Watching $220 level. Also likely affected by Meta's superintelligence push and signal to continue spending in AI space.

[**SATS (EchoStar)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SATS&p=d)\-Trump urged EchoStar and FCC to resolve spectrum license dispute. This happened at the close on Friday but it seems this won't hold up the move completely (currently $24 vs $27). DirecTV terminated its agreement to acquire EchoStar's satellite television business last year over a failed debt-exchange offer. The FCC told EchoStar it was investigating the company's compliance obligations to provide 5G service in the U.S. (due to its buildout extension and mobile-satellite service).

[**USO**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=USO&p=d) **/** [**GLD**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GLD&p=d) **/** [**VXX**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d) \- Day 4 of Iran/Israel conflict, USO/Vol/gold has been elevated since the attacks. Mainly looking for escalation, since the conflict has been signaled to last weeks, I will likely not do anything in this until escalation occurs. Middle Eastern conflict (especially between countries) drive energy costs up and gold/vol rallies during risk-off events (like war). Not an immediate trade worth looking at today, likely this will happen during OVERNIGHT or afterhours. 

[**CRCL (Circle)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&p=d) \- Set ATH after a recent explosive IPO. IPOs lately have been explosive. Already broke the $140 level, watching the $150 level next but unlikely to go extremely heavy in this even if we get up there. Remember that CRCL is heavily intertwined with the C industry and essentially is one of the stableCs. The big C is already near ATH, so I'm interested in seeing if we're able to make a significant move today.

Actually laughed out loud that Carney blew his syphilitic mind by explaining basic policy No, markets are rising from when people bought the Friday dip, because this is what the stock market is now. Why is everything pumping? I can understand brushing off the war stuff and tariffs but there's no actual news or reason to pump? At best the market should be flat. Not visiting this sub or checking the news everyday has been very helpful in buying dips. Since I dont even see what the FUD is and come back a week later and FUD is gone or not as big of a deal.

 After NVDA’s latest earnings, it feels like the entire market got even more hyped about AI. Analysts are raising their price targets, and I’m starting to wonder if I’ve already missed the boat.

I haven’t opened any positions yet, mostly because I’m worried about buying in too high. A few friends suggested looking into AI-focused ETFs or second-tier chip suppliers, since those might carry less risk while still riding the trend. Just wondering how others are approaching this right now. 
This post is the sell signal I don’t think you’re going to crush it with this level of DD so I’d just buy ETFs and DCA and save. If I were to be building a position in anything right now, unless we get more downside, it would be GOOGLE. So sell? Sell signal? 

This post means there are many who are not on board yet

$NVDA has a forward PE of 33, hardly in bubble territory 

$TSM, which dominates the entire AI chip fabrication industry, trades only at a forward PE of 22

$GOOG, which has tons of great assets and currently the best model, is cheap at a forward PE of 19

MAG 7's capex as a percentage of their operating cash flow is actually far lower than telcos during the Internet Boom of the late 1990s. We are at best around 1995/1996 level, meaning there are lots of room to grow. 

Despite the massive increase in capex, Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft are still able to grow their free cash flow on an absolute basis

1lc3azy,2025-06-15,"All time highs on the horizon
Nvidia Corporation is attractively valued and its strong EPS growth and profitability outpacing peers make it a compelling entry point. AI-driven demand from hyperscalers and new sovereign deals (UAE, Saudi Arabia) provides long-term headroom for continued growth. Despite the loss of China revenues and recent price stagnation, NVIDIA's fundamentals remain strong and its market leadership unquestioned. I am upgrading my rating on NVDA stock to Strong Buy, believing it is capable of delivering superior returns and has the potential to reach a $10 trillion valuation.



When I looked at NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ) late last year, I thought the stock had a pretty good shot at 2025. While the stock has soared, the valuation has fallen because of strong earnings growth, thanks in large part to the seemingly never-ending demand for GPUs in exascale computing platforms. 2025 was destined to be the “Year of Blackwell,” and I expected the stock to continue to rise, albeit at a slower pace than in previous years.

Instead, we saw the stock briefly try to break out to a new all-time high, or ATH, before reversing sharply and selling off. We know the various reasons for this reversal. On the one hand, the broader market sold off amid tariff uncertainty, and few companies were immune. the release of DeepSeek (DEEPSEEK) in early 2025 triggered a sort of flash panic, with some claiming that the boom time for high-end chips was over. The logic was that DeepSeek would be able to save costs and increase efficiency so dramatically that companies running AI reasoning could rely on much less powerful chips. I think the evidence so far is that this reasoning is completely wrong, and instead we're seeing the Jevons Paradox come true.

It was probably inevitable that NVIDIA would now lose essentially all of its China-related revenue. At a recent conference, CFO Colette Kress pretty much poured cold water on the company's prospects for generating further revenue in China.

In my opinion, NVIDIA is attractively valued. The two best performers this year among the Big 7 tech giants have been Microsoft and Meta. looking at how NVIDIA compares to these peers, I see a big gap between them at the moment. In terms of price-to-earnings ratio, NVIDIA's valuation sits right in the middle of the three, but in terms of return on invested capital and medium-term EPS projections, it's way ahead.
What is this shit You think we should invest in Nvidia? What a bold suggestion. You don’t need AI to write your “ opinion” on NVDA. People who are bullish on NVDA already know. My guess is you bought at 140 lol.

You also gonna skip over the big elephant in the room which is the war thats going on. ""anyone against my opinion is wrong, but this obviously bias post written by AI that agrees with me? That has valid information."" 'all time highs incoming!!!'
 
📉

Puts it is. Thanks OP. Most post call for DCA, and almost everyone expects bear because economy and tariff says so. Bear isn't a crash, some just don't want to invest before a dip then wasting time.


Take Trump tariff opening for example. The epic dive then ""historic rally"" was over 4 month, and in May, some stocks finally reclimbed to above November. Still bullish, but let's not pretend that the NVDA dollar is cheap. Yes, fundamentals matter, but so does sentiment. A pause isn't the end of the world, it's healthy.

1lbzmse,2025-06-15,"What To Expect in Markets This Week: June 16–20, 2025
No paywall: [https://www.investopedia.com/what-to-expect-in-markets-this-week-fed-rate-decision-juneteenth-holiday-us-retail-sales-tesla-robotaxi-rollout-11753474](https://www.investopedia.com/what-to-expect-in-markets-this-week-fed-rate-decision-juneteenth-holiday-us-retail-sales-tesla-robotaxi-rollout-11753474)

There's a lot on the domestic calendar this week. But investors and the world are watching global affairs, too.

Meanwhile, several market-driving events are due in the coming days. The Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, consumer spending data, and possible news on President Donald Trump's tariffs headline the week. Thursday's Juneteenth holiday will mean a break from trading.

The Fed will hand down another decision on interest rates this week, with a decision scheduled for Wednesday. The coming weekend could see Tesla providing a significant update on the direction of the electric vehicle maker.

Did consumers in May continue to prop up the economy? Tuesday's U.S. retail sales will make it clear whether strong spending levels continued, while housing construction data will provide insight into whether builders are catching up with lagging inventory levels. Investors will continue to watch for trade developments as negotiations continue between U.S. officials and key trading partners.

It’s a light week for corporate earnings, highlighted by expected reports from homebuilder Lennar, accounting firm Accenture, grocery chain Kroger, and online used car seller CarMax.

# Fed Interest-Rate Decision Comes Amid Increasing Pressure for Cuts

Fed officials have said they are keeping rates steady amid a strong labor market as they monitor inflation data for signs that Trump’s tariffs are driving up prices.

But the pressure is on the Federal Reserve after May inflation data came in lower than economists expected. Despite comments from President Donald Trump urging the Fed to make a one-point cut, investors don't expect the central bank to take action when its two-day meeting concludes on Wednesday.

The CME FedWatch Tool, which measures fed funds futures to determine the path of interest rates, indicates that traders overwhelmingly believe that Fed will keep rates at their current levels in June. They also don't expect the central bank to move rates at its late July meeting.

After the meeting concludes on Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will provide more insight into the central bank’s view on the economy and interest rates when he takes media questions.

On Tuesday, retail sales figures from May will provide another barometer of the economy's health Consumer spending makes up about two-thirds of the U.S. economy. Meanwhile, housing data will also be scrutinized as affordability issues continue to depress home sales. The latest homebuilder confidence reading on Tuesday will show if construction industry officials see improvements coming in the market, while Wednesday’s housing starts data will indicate whether construction levels are rising amid a need for more housing inventory.

# Tesla Robotaxi Rollout Could Come as Early as Sunday

After months of waiting, investors could soon get a key update from electric vehicle maker Tesla (TSLA). CEO Elon Musk said in a recent social media post that the company could roll out its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, as early as Sunday, June 22. ""We are being super paranoid about safety, so the date could shift,"" Musk wrote.

The introduction of the company's robotaxi service could be a key moment for Tesla, which is banking on artificial intelligence (AI) and self-driving vehicles to become the transportation technologies of the future. Tesla is well-positioned to lead the market in the emerging technology, analysts have concluded, with Goldman Sachs writing that the EV maker could have a leg up on the competition through its ability to train self-driving through its AI development and to quickly scale production levels of the technology.

Despite a light corporate earnings schedule this week, investors will still get some expected updates from noteworthy companies.

Lennar’s (LEN) expected report after the bell on Monday follows the homebuilder's warning of weakness in the housing market in the prior quarter.  The scheduled Friday reports from accounting firm Accenture (ACN) and online car seller CarMax (KMX) will be posted in the shadow of both companies' lower-than-expected profits in the prior quarter.

Just a kind and gentle reminder that only 1 trade deal has been struck as of June 15.

Billions and billions and billions and trillions and billions.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Dude I live in a neighboring country just 175 miles from Iran's Boushehr nuclear plant. My buttcheeks have been clenched all week. Apparently NVO's patent on semaglutide lapsed in Canada because someone didn't pay the annual fee lol. 

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GtbcBIRaIAA0MwY?format=png&name=900x900 Good thing Trump was in office, so nobody started any shit... lmao.

Meanwhile, Orange Turd sits in front of empty bleachers at his pathetic N Korea style, military birthday parade, like his birthday is a National Holiday. Urban Guatemala Clearly all important buildings have been evacuated in Israel and Iran. Now it's just a bomb dick measuring contest. Gold is going to open above $3,500 on Monday, shit are escalating in the Middle East I made the mistake of not believing Trumps tariff threats and not believing Israel would just start thwacking Iran's non-nuclear sites. We need to begin assuming the world is run by 15 year old boys and make decisions from there. Trump thinks about a lot of things. Or nothing at all. Hard to tell what’s floating in his head at any given time I'd posted that BA was likely not primarily at fault in the India crash. The r/aviation thread got pretty spammy,  but [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/aircrashinvestigation/comments/1lb1s6g/updated_air_india_flight_171_accident_analysis/) thread on r/aircrashinvestigation is really solid. It breaks down numerous possibilities leading to some of the more likely causes of the crash (likely loss of power to both engines simultaneously just a few seconds after takeoff). The author offers a few possible reasons why this could happen, but is smart enough not to draw a conclusion yet. Great read. 

A few notes, airliners are designed to takeoff and fly safely if one engine goes out. Dual engine failure, simultaneously, is crazy rare. Aborted take offs due to any slight discrepancy are relatively common, as pilots are trained to not even try to take off if there are any irregularities. 

Oddly, commercial aircraft are sold without engines included so that airlines can pick which engines they want.

1lani7x,2025-06-13,"1y3m update on ""HIMS, a potential tenbagger?""
First: Hello again, long time no see.

Second: I´m not a native speaker, so please have mercy on grammar or spelling.

Over a year and 3 months ago, I made a post about Hims ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bfnfzj/hims\_a\_potential\_tenbagger/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bfnfzj/hims_a_potential_tenbagger/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) ). I read all the comments and most were critical. But the stock performed excellently, from 14$ to (at time of writing) 57$. So I thought I would provide an update. But please come to your own conclusions and don´t invest because some random on reddit wrote about it.

I still hold HIMS, so I may be biased. I sold 30% in Feb 2025 because HIMS had reached a too-high-percentage of my portfolio. I got my initial investment out and then some (974$ gain). But I still believ it´s a great investment (though not as good as the time of my fist post). I don´t believe it will be a tenbagger in the next years, but maybe in the next decade and some. I think many investors should focus on the basics and not overcomplicate things, so I´ll focus on what I consider the key metrics/facts/visions.

  
About HIMS:

Hims & Hers is the leading health and wellness platform on a mission to help the world feel great through the power of better health. We believe how you feel in your body and mind transforms how you show up in life. That’s why we’re building a future where nothing stands in the way of harnessing this power. HIMS & HERS normalizes health & wellness challenges - and innovations on their solutions - to make feeling happy and healthy easy to achieve. No two people are the same, so the Company provides access to personalized care designed for results. (copied from website)

  
First some general summarized information. Further down I´ll share my opiniosns on individual factors. HIMS is still massivly growing its revenue, 111% (Q1\_2024 vs Q1\_2025). Prifitability and cash flow have also increased significantly. This increase is inflated by their expansion into weight loss. They have a share repurchase program to offset dilution from management bonuses. They hold the largest market share in the U.S. and have reduced their marketing expenses relative to revenue. 

HIMS is a grower and a shower. They’ve increased all key metrics, revenue, EBITDA, net income, cash flow, subscriptions, and Average Order Volume (AOV). AOV will be discussed later. Everything is growing yoy. The only exception is net income in Q3\_2024, which had a one-time tax write-off that artificially boosted the number. In their FY 2025 guidance, they still project around 60% revenue growth and a 1–2% increase in their EBITDA margin. They also published a 2030 plan forecasting over 6,5 billion $ in revenue and 1,3 billion $ in EBITDA. This would represent excellent growth. And to top it all off, they’ve consistently outperformed their own projections (they reached their 2025 goal a year early).

One big iussue was their huge marketing expense. They’ve reduced the percentage of marketing expenses (relative to revenue) to 39%. This can be seen as a positive. But keep in mind: the negative impacts of reduced marketing often don’t show up immediately, they may appear in the years to come.

Weight loss... . This stock was always pretty volatile, but the weight loss segment increased its volatility tenfold (a tenbagger in volatility hehe). HIMS benefited significantly from weight loss products until Lilly and Novo Nordisk could meet demand. Many thought this would be the end of HIMS’s weight loss business. But they made an incredible move: They partnered with Novo Nordisk and can now continue selling weight loss medication. The big question is whether HIMS will be able to retain these customers. Wegovy will be drastically more expensive than what they previously offered. Only time will tell. Through the weight loss segment, AOV increased. This partnership could push AOV even higher, but some customers may leave due to affordability.

One Pro-argument in my last post was the absent of debt, which now has changed. They issued convertible bonds worth around 870 mission $ with no coupon payments. They used this to acquire a European telehealth platform (ZAVA). With this acquisition, they aim to expand into Europe. This is, in my opinion, the most critical and potentially negative aspect of the company. I'm from Germany, and I believe this move carries significant risks for HIMS. Their business model is tailored to the U.S. market. European healthcare is drastically different, far more bureaucracy, different mindsets about healthcare, and a very different insurance landscape. What calms me slightly is the recent addition of an expert in this field to the supervisory board. I’m still not sold on this move, but I’ll wait and see. 

  
Now some updated opinions from my last post:

1. Insiders still own 13% of the shares (huge green flag).

2. They’ve proven themselves and built a moderate moat with their branding

3.Telehealth is still pretty competitive, but they’ve positioned themselves wel. 

  
Overall I think this company still has huge potential. I believe they’re no longer undervalued but have reached a fair valuation. I will hold on to my position (70% of my initial investment). But I don’t expect to see anything comparable to the last 1.25 years in the near future. 

  
I´m interested in your opinions. Give me your worst :) and have a great day.
This has been one of my best performing stocks over the last couple years. I bought throughout 2023 and have since sold about half. I do think it's overvalued currently, but still like the direction, so will continue to hold. I also do sell covered calls on my position. Generic dick pills and Fin isn’t a strong moat to me. I feel the strength is in its branding alone. They are still dealing with patent issues on the weight loss stuff. I agree with the moat. But with the partnership with Novo they can still sell wegovy, even in the worst case",0,0.38,3,0,DeuSovKam,stocks,['GME'],1y3m update hims potential tenbagger first hello long time see second im native speaker please mercy grammar spelling year 3 months ago made post hims read comments critical stock performed excellently 14 time writing 57 thought would provide update please come conclusions dont invest random reddit wrote still hold hims may biased sold 30 feb 2025 hims reached toohighpercentage portfolio got initial investment 974 gain still believ great investment though good time fist post dont believe tenbagger next years maybe next decade think many investors focus basics overcomplicate things ill focus consider key metricsfactsvisions hims hims leading health wellness platform mission help world feel great power better health believe feel body mind transforms show life thats building future nothing stands way harnessing power hims normalizes health wellness challenges innovations solutions make feeling happy healthy easy achieve two people company provides access personalized care designed results copied website first general summarized information ill share opiniosns individual factors hims still massivly growing revenue 111 q1_2024 vs q1_2025 prifitability cash flow also increased significantly increase inflated expansion weight loss share repurchase program offset dilution management bonuses hold largest market share us reduced marketing expenses relative revenue hims grower shower theyve increased key metrics revenue ebitda net income cash flow subscriptions average order volume aov aov discussed later everything growing yoy exception net income q3_2024 onetime tax writeoff artificially boosted number fy 2025 guidance still project around 60 revenue growth 12 increase ebitda margin also published 2030 plan forecasting 65 billion revenue 13 billion ebitda would represent excellent growth top theyve consistently outperformed projections reached 2025 goal year early one big iussue huge marketing expense theyve reduced percentage marketing expenses relative revenue 39 seen positive keep mind negative impacts reduced marketing often dont show immediately may appear years come weight loss stock always pretty volatile weight loss segment increased volatility tenfold tenbagger volatility hehe hims benefited significantly weight loss products lilly novo nordisk could meet demand many thought would end himss weight loss business made incredible move partnered novo nordisk continue selling weight loss medication big question whether hims able retain customers wegovy drastically expensive previously offered time tell weight loss segment aov increased partnership could push aov even higher customers may leave due affordability one proargument last post absent debt changed issued convertible bonds worth around 870 mission coupon payments used acquire european telehealth platform zava acquisition aim expand europe opinion critical potentially negative aspect company im germany believe move carries significant risks hims business model tailored us market european healthcare drastically different far bureaucracy different mindsets healthcare different insurance landscape calms slightly recent addition expert field supervisory board im still sold move ill wait see updated opinions last post 1 insiders still 13 shares huge green flag 2 theyve proven built moderate moat branding 3telehealth still pretty competitive theyve positioned wel overall think company still huge potential believe theyre longer undervalued reached fair valuation hold position 70 initial investment dont expect see anything comparable last 125 years near future im interested opinions give worst great day one best performing stocks last couple years bought throughout 2023 since sold half think overvalued currently still like direction continue hold also sell covered calls position generic dick pills fin isnt strong moat feel strength branding alone still dealing patent issues weight loss stuff agree moat partnership novo still sell wegovy even worst case
1lalxr5,2025-06-13,"US to Ease Rules Hindering Tesla’s Self-Driving Cybercab
Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration is taking steps that would make it easier for automakers to deploy-self driving cars without driver controls, a potential boon to the ambitions of Tesla Inc. and rivals looking to put robotaxis on US roads in the near future.

Current rules require automakers that want to deploy self-driving cars designed without a steering wheel or brake pedals to seek an exemption from federal safety standards that effectively require that new cars have human driving controls. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will “streamline” that exemption process, which under current policy has resulted in lengthy processing times that can last years, the agency said in a letter posted to its website on Friday.

As a result of the changes, NHTSA “anticipates reaching decisions on most exemption requests within months rather than years,” NHTSA Chief Counsel Peter Simshauser said in the letter.

The move takes aim at one of the biggest regulatory hurdles facing Tesla’s plan to field its self-driving Cybercab in large numbers. The vehicle, revealed on a Hollywood studio lot last year, lacks a steering wheel and foot pedals, jeopardizing Tesla’s ability to introduce it without an exemption from the agency.

The vehicle is a key part of Tesla’s push into artificial intelligence and robotics that Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has said are critical to the company’s future.

Tesla’s shares touched a session high and rose 1.5% as of 12:29 p.m. in New York.

Tesla later this month plans to launch its initial robotaxi business in Austin, using self-driving Model Y SUVs overseen by remote operators. The company aims to eventually incorporate the purpose-built Cybercab into its fleet after Tesla begins producing them in large numbers next year.

Musk, who donated more than $250 million to help President Donald Trump’s reelection and until recently had led a sweeping push to slash government spending, has called for a federal approval process for autonomous vehicles.

Members of Trump’s transition team also planned to make creating a regulatory framework for autonomous vehicles a top priority, Bloomberg has reported.
And here I thought Tesla's FSD was the hold back...Let's plow the populace now then. Still sucks compared to Waymo. Its like regulations making DIVX easier to sell. Cool, everyone is using DVD. Yeah but who is going to possibly insurance your fleet of shit driving robo taxis? Even if you can* the cost will probably be so high it's not worth it.

So he went to Chetto on his knees begging for forgiveness and now this comes out 🤔 Lol how many rides will you have to sell to recoup the investment of a car and how long will that take ? Did that moron just compared a piece of garbage car to buying property? LOL Classic USA. The product sucked so much it can't go to market, simply remove the regulation's now it's fine and in a couple of years time complain about why foreign countries don't want your products. Brother do you think the insurance risk of a rental home and a fleet of self driving vehicles is even remotely the same thing? You've got to be trolling, naive or delusional.

1lahztb,2025-06-13,"Swedish pension fund blacklists Tesla, divests stake
June 13 (AFP) -- Swedish pension fund AP7 said Friday it had blacklisted Tesla over the US company's lack of respect for labour rights in the US, and had sold off its $1.4 billion stake in the US carmaker.
The fund said in a statement that it had decided ""to blacklist Tesla due to verified violations of union rights in the United States.""
""Despite several years of dialogue with Tesla, including shareholder proposals in collaboration with other investors, the company has not taken sufficient measures to address the issues,"" the fund said.
AP7 spokesman Mikael Lindh Hok told AFP the fund had divested its entire stake, worth 13 billion kronor ($1.4 billion), in late May.
He said the stake represented one percent of the fund's total assets.
The electric carmaker has also been involved in a labour dispute with Swedish unions since 2023.
In late October of that year, the metal workers union IF Metall launched a strike against Tesla over its refusal to sign a collective wage agreement, and some 130 mechanics at 10 Tesla repair shops in seven cities walked off the job.
IF Metall then extended the strike to include work on Teslas at other repair shops which served multiple brands.
The strike then grew into a larger conflict between Tesla and almost a dozen unions seeking to protect Sweden's labour model, including postal workers, dock workers and even spreading to neighbouring Nordic countries.
Tesla chief Elon Musk has long rejected calls to allow the company's employees worldwide to unionise.
Musk's close cooperation with US President Donald Trump has also led to calls for boycotts against Tesla.

1ladnpi,2025-06-13,"Barclays: History suggests S&P 500 could mark turning point
With the S&P 500 now trading at 22 times next-twelve-month earnings, Barclays analysts say “valuation alone may not be one” of the major headwinds facing equities.

“SPX is back to 22x NTM EPS,” Barclays wrote, noting that “30 years of history suggest that current levels could signal bear capitulation assuming EPS growth stays positive.”

Barclays examined three decades of forward returns across valuation bands and found that “while average returns decreased (and the variance of those returns increased) as valuations rose from 10x to about 21x, returns actually improved modestly (and variance decreased) as NTM P/E crossed over 22x, up to about 24x.”

The analysts argued that this range “has typically traded at these levels for sustained periods in the aftermath of fast sell-offs and subsequent V-shaped recoveries (1998 and 2020 being prime examples),” adding that “22x could be a good approximation of where bears capitulate and ’animal spirits’ fuel the chase for additional upside.”

Stocks like AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, BGM, PANW, and FTNT could benefit if valuations remain elevated and earnings growth picks up, as Barclays notes.

They cautioned, however, that “equities could be choppy over the near term as markets await clarity on US fiscal policy,” and that “2Q25 earnings \[are\] likely to feature the first substantive hit from tariffs.”

Still, Barclays emphasized that “we see a limited case for valuation alone as an argument against further upside,” especially if “earnings growth picks up to \~9% in 2026, as we expect,” they wrote.

Barclays concluded that while “several pitfalls from fiscal to tariffs lay ahead for equities,” the market’s current valuation is not necessarily a ceiling.
So basically they don’t know shit. Got it. 22 PE? Thats like a forward earnings yield of 4.5% assuming no recession and everything is tip top. 10 year bond yield was higher last week haha [deleted] No one does, everything hinges on whatever Trump tweets next. And not even he knows what he's gonna tweet. So basically it means that the market could go up or down, or maybe stay stable. 


Ok, gotcha.  Treasuries aren't a bad buy if you ask me; cheapest (especially on the long end) they've been in decades, and best ""PE"" in a long time as well. I think there are some plays to be made there and a place in a portfolio.

Or at a minimum, good to avoid the recency bias of the low interest rate era, which may be the only era young investors have experienced. A look-forward analysis from the 1980s is not relevant to today. It is ignoring confounding variables that did not exist in the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s. 

Algorithmic trading, high-frequency trading, deep learning algorithms, multi-collateral leveraged derivatives, these are all examples of trading strategies which did not exist until the late 2000s.

So this study is meaningless without controlling for them, they vastly changed how the stock market operates. “Expect volatility…” That conclusion kills me. Things are looking bad but hey, the market can still go higher. Yields have been as low as they are partly because of the dollar’s reserve status. If DXY keeps tanking because of US fiscal policy causing uncertainty, there’s a risk that we lose that status, and that could get ugly.",194,0.88,62,0,Zestyclose-Salad-290,stocks,"['AAPL', 'AMZN', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL']",barclays history suggests sp 500 could mark turning point sp 500 trading 22 times nexttwelvemonth earnings barclays analysts say valuation alone may one major headwinds facing equities spx back 22x ntm eps barclays wrote noting 30 years history suggest current levels could signal bear capitulation assuming eps growth stays positive barclays examined three decades forward returns across valuation bands found average returns decreased variance returns increased valuations rose 10x 21x returns actually improved modestly variance decreased ntm pe crossed 22x 24x analysts argued range typically traded levels sustained periods aftermath fast selloffs subsequent vshaped recoveries 1998 2020 prime examples adding 22x could good approximation bears capitulate animal spirits fuel chase additional upside stocks like aapl msft amzn googl bgm panw ftnt could benefit valuations remain elevated earnings growth picks barclays notes cautioned however equities could choppy near term markets await clarity us fiscal policy 2q25 earnings likely feature first substantive hit tariffs still barclays emphasized see limited case valuation alone argument upside especially earnings growth picks 9 2026 expect wrote barclays concluded several pitfalls fiscal tariffs lay ahead equities markets current valuation necessarily ceiling basically dont know shit got 22 pe thats like forward earnings yield 45 assuming recession everything tip top 10 year bond yield higher last week haha deleted one everything hinges whatever trump tweets next even knows hes gonna tweet basically means market could go maybe stay stable ok gotcha treasuries arent bad buy ask cheapest especially long end theyve decades best pe long time well think plays made place portfolio minimum good avoid recency bias low interest rate era may era young investors experienced lookforward analysis 1980s relevant today ignoring confounding variables exist 1980s 1990s early 2000s algorithmic trading highfrequency trading deep learning algorithms multicollateral leveraged derivatives examples trading strategies exist late 2000s study meaningless without controlling vastly changed stock market operates expect volatility conclusion kills things looking bad hey market still go higher yields low partly dollars reserve status dxy keeps tanking us fiscal policy causing uncertainty theres risk lose status could get ugly

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1la3dyr,2025-06-13,"Investing in Escapism?
Hello there,

I’m a 28 yo gen Z from Thailand, been investing since I was 22. Currently holding about $119k in stocks.

The recent trends I’ve noticed from my peers is the general hopelessness and they will prefer to indulge themselves now over saving for the future. I believe that dissatisfaction/being miserable makes you spend more money, and asian people are very dissatisfied with themselves.

So I’ve been thinking what if this will become a long term trend? My biggest positions are Alibaba, Tencent (700), and Meta. my Meta shares were bought at $133 so they were doing quite well. Tencent was bought this year up 25%

While many turn to gaming (and I’m addicted to one myself), gaming stocks seem like a poor investment, I’ve heard gaming companies being compared to biotech in terms of risk. I have a small position on Gravity (GRVY) but it has been performing quite disappointingly.

I believe value added service/social media will be better pick since you make money off of ads and user content. in this regards, I think Tencent holds an incredible economic moat and is relatively well protected from tariffs compared to its peers. I also own LY Corp (4689) which operates Yahoo and LINE both are quite popular in Japan, LINE is also big in Thailand as well.

But I want to ask for your insights, do you think which industries or companies in particular will perform well in this era of increasing isolation and escapism?

Thank you for reading!



$RDDT, literally use it as my my social life where I can get responses from ""real people"" so it fills that convo aspect and its probably 90% of my social media usage. 


Its still early that even tho they are making money with ads now, they are implementing and testing out new features for ads and I believe reddit lite is in testing which is like a scrolling like system like tiktok and there are talks about premium subreddits, think of adult content for the lonely simps there plenty of more things they are working on to get ppl more addicted.


Online escapism will only get more addicting, ppl cannot simply live without a phone and a growing population. Theres subreddits filled with majority haters out there, rather than spend time going outside all they do is post negativity in these subreddits. They'd rather do that than have a good time irl. Fucking calls. Phones and videogames are replacing it An old standard alcohol escapism, some are at 10 year lows because the general consensus is weed is going to replace it. I was at the bar one night recently and a guy was drunk ranting about how less and less people are coming out and the younger crowd just stays home and gets high now lol. Your comment makes me think of that drunken rant. I used to work in games. Did a stint at Bethesda, arenanet and blizzard. I don’t own any games stocks. Business model is more similar to movies than to software. I add “reddit” at the end of all my google searches nowadays. I haven’t really looked into the company but how did they turn profitable? I’m worried that the long term monetization might not work out as even twitter never turned a profit, and Reddit doesn’t feel as heavily monetized as Facebook/Insta.

But that’s a good pick and I should really give it a closer look for sure

Edit: I didn’t see your edits when I was writing the replies which you added more insight into its path to profitability and monetization. Couldn't think of a better phrase but basically being in shape (looks-maxing) to improve your social status. Obviously its a much healther addiction than the other 2. Roblox seems really popular for gen z but it's already had a huge runup and still has a negative EPS. 

While I don't have a huge conviction in alcohol stocks some of them might be worth watching as they're low (DEO at like a 9-year low) and pay an okay dividend. 

Meta and tencent were both probably really good choices on your part. 

I think it'll take some advanced VR technology to really make escapism investing a money maker. Maybe Amazon in the meantime though, as they'll probably be the ones delivering the escape. I removed this part about why they had negative balance and ppl overreacted in their earlier reports and let chatgpt explain it better


Here’s why Reddit had a net loss:

Stock-Based Compensation (SBC):

When Reddit went public (IPO), it granted stock to employees and executives as compensation.

These non-cash expenses are recorded on the income statement, making the company look like it’s losing more money than it really is from operations.

Example: In their 2024 Q1 earnings, over $600 million of their costs were from stock-based compensation alone.

This is common for tech IPOs — similar things happened with companies like Uber and Rivian after IPOs.

IPO-Related Costs:

These are one-time costs tied to legal, banking, and administrative fees required for going public.

That further increased losses during that reporting period.

Payments to Early Investors (via Preferred Stock Conversion):

Some investor payouts or preferred stock conversions triggered by IPO terms also added to accounting losses. Reddit mentioned ""deemed dividends"" related to these preferred stock changes.

These payments don’t represent operational cash flowing out immediately but affect net income calculations.

Operating Loss (but much smaller):

Reddit’s core business was still unprofitable, but not by a massive margin.

Revenue was growing from advertising and premium features, but they’re investing heavily in AI, data licensing, and infrastructure to grow, which cuts into profitability.

✅ So in summary:

True: A huge reason Reddit showed a large net loss was accounting charges tied to IPO-related stock-based compensation and investor-related adjustments, not necessarily because the business itself was fundamentally broken.

Their cash position is strong, and they’re aiming for profitability in 2025 with ad growth and new licensing deals (like the big AI data deal with Google).

1l9t8dr,2025-06-12,"How Do Cap Gains/Losses Work?
Hi all! Thanks in advance for your help here.

Long story short - I realized ~$20k in losses back during the tariff meltdown. I sold out of some index ETF’s and bought into some oversold tech stocks (NVDA, AMD, META etc) and have done quite well with them. I’m looking to shave some of my profits but don’t want to realize short term cap gains in the process. If I sell and realize $10k in gains, will I owe the respective short term cap gain, or will the loss that I realized compensate for the gain?

Thanks!
As long as the gains and losses occur within the same year, they will cancel each other out. Absolutely, yes. The time of purchase doesn't matter, only the time of sale. The type of security doesn't matter either. It could be from selling stocks or selling property (land, house, etc). Capital gains and losses are all that matters, and the time of sale. This will be a bit reductive, but it covers most of what you need to know except for weird fringe cases...

As long as the positions in question have been held for less than a year, then you'll only be taxed on the final tally at the end of the year. Ex: If April–>June was a 100k gain but then June–>December is an 80k loss, you're only on the hook for a 20k gain. Just keep in mind that it's a year *from when you bought the equity/opened the position*, not necessarily like ""2025"" or ""2024"" or whatever.

The other big thing to be careful with is ""wash sales""; the easiest (and again, reductive) way to think about this is that the gov't doesn't want you selling a position at a loss and then buying right back in so that you still have the equity but can claim a loss on your taxes. Here the main concern is whether you bought back in *within 30 days* of exiting the position (after 30 days you're fine, though the rules from my previous paragraph apply). ONE MORE IMPORTANT CAVEAT is that if you sell a position in, say, ETF X at a loss, then immediately buy in to ETF Y, but they're very similar ETFs (think like VOO vs SPY), then the wash sale rule still applies.

TLDR; just worry about your net profit/loss if you're opening/closing positions that are less than 365 days old (regardless of the time of year/month), and don't look for loopholes like ""I'll sell SPY to create a paper-loss and then just buy back in immediately or just buy in to VOO instead"". The paper loss won't apply.

\*This is a financial explanation and not advice\* >	The time of purchase doesn’t matter, only the time of sale. The type of security doesn’t matter either. It could be from selling stocks or selling property (land, house, etc). Capital gains and losses are all that matters, and the time of sale.

Wait, seriously? So I can offset 20k of short term gains with 20k of long term losses? That’s pretty awesome. Got it, thanks! The loss was in VOO entirely, and I’ve purchased nothing but single stocks since. Thinking I’m going to move out of some winners and into a few other beaten down names now with the profits. I should be ok in doing so since I realized such a big loss earlier this year. > As long as the gains and losses occur within the same year, they will cancel each other out.

assuming they're the same type, right? like, if he took long term losses in april, he can't use those to cancel out short term gains he made with april purchases he sells in october?
(and shouldn't he be able to carry over any realized losses to next year that he didn't use this year?) best of luck with your strategy. i do feel that maybe youve gotten a bit overly confident that just because a stock is beaten down, it will return to its glory days. again best of luck Lol I’m not buying pink sheets, I’m selling some AMD and buying AAPL.

1l9rh58,2025-06-12,"Oracle shares pop 15% to record high on earnings beat, cloud optimism
Oracle shares soared 15% on Thursday and headed for a record close and their best day since 2021, after the database software vendor issued robust earnings and a strong forecast, fueled by growth in cloud.

Revenue climbed 11% year over year during the fiscal fourth quarter to $15.9 billion, topping the $15.59 billion average estimate, according to LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.70 exceeded the average analyst estimate of $1.64.

“All told, ORCL has entered an entirely new wave of enterprise popularity that it has not seen since the Internet era in the late 90s,” Piper Sandler analysts wrote in a note to clients. The firm was one of several to lift its price target on the stock, raising its prediction to $190 from $130.

Oracle has been making headway in the cloud infrastructure market to challenge Amazon, Google and Microsoft. It’s still small by comparison, with $3 billion in cloud revenue during the May quarter, compared with over $12 billion for Google, which counts productivity software subscriptions and cloud infrastructure sales when reporting cloud metrics. But Oracle’s business is growing faster.

Future expansion can also come from sales of Oracle’s database on clouds other than its own.

“The growth rate in multi-cloud is astonishing,” Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison said on Wednesday’s conference call with analysts. “In other words, our database is now moving very rapidly to the cloud, I think because – a few reasons, because the database has now all these AI capabilities, but also, quite frankly, now people can get it in whatever cloud they want.”

Remaining performance obligations, a measurement of money that’s expected to be recognized as revenue in the future, sat at $138 billion, up 41% from a year earlier. Oracle CEO Safra Catz said RPO will likely more than double in the 2026 fiscal year, which ends in May 2026. Revenue for the new fiscal year should come in above $67 billion, she said. That’s higher than LSEG’s $65.18 billion consensus.

Gains from OpenAI’s Stargate artificial intelligence data center project, targeting $500 billion in investments over four years, are not yet included in forecasts.

“If Stargate turns out to be, everything is advertised, then we’ve understated our RPO growth,” Ellison said.

For fiscal 2029, revenue should be above the $104 billion target the company set in September, Catz said.

Still, the company faces the challenge of meeting client demand in cloud.

“Demand continues to dramatically outstrip supply,” Catz said, though she added that the company isn’t having trouble sourcing Nvidia graphics processing units.

Analysts at RBC, who recommend holding the stock, raised their price target to $195 to $145. But they noted that, “with the backdrop of continued capacity constraints, we struggle to see a path to meaningful acceleration in the near term.”

1l9pxhg,2025-06-12,"How are you positioning yourself to take advantage of the rise of the EV market?
It’s clear the adoption of EVs and EV related legislation around the world has varied quite a bit, but we seem to be at an interesting inflection point, where several countries (like the UK) have made commitments to phase out the sale of ICEs within the next decade and shift to EVs. To be clear I’m not asking what specific EV consumer brands you like, though that’s an interesting question.

I’m thinking more broadly about enabling infrastructure, raw materials (e.g. lithium production), etc. If we assume that overall the world will increasingly rely on EVs as the years go on, what underlying primary or secondary markets do you envision becoming attractive? 

To start - I’m very interested in companies that mine and refine lithium, and exploring ways to get some exposure to lithium and earth metal refining in my portfolio. 
Lithium is abundant and oversupplied currently. You're better off picking EV manufacturers that you think will win. BYDDY I’m not. They’re are better sectors to put your $ in than the automotive one If you think EVs are taking over, then a no-brainer would be tires. EV's are heavier because the batteries create a heavier car that wears the tires down faster. So tire sales should increase. 

But, if you believe in robotaxis, then that would mean less cars on the road and so less tires sold overall. > where several countries (like the UK) have made commitments to phase out the sale of ICEs within the next decade and shift to EVs.

saying they'll do it and actually doing it are completely different things. just look at the track record that various countries have for hitting their emissions targets, or going to fully renewable energy. (or america's track record on switching to the metric system).

when push comes to shove, the electrical infrastructure to support what these states/countries are mandating isn't there, so they're going to ultimately be forced to push them back decades. True. Auto stocks have never been diamonds in the rough. >Tesla is set to grow at 50% for the next 10 years

Meta Platforms has hired Jack Rae, a researcher at Google's DeepMind AI unit, to join its new ""superintelligence"" division, Bloomberg News reported. 

This follows news that Meta invested a whopping $14.8 billion to acquire a 49% stake in Scale AI to help build out the new unit tasked with the goal of achieving a more advanced form of AI.

Tens of millions. and that's when delete Messenger which is the last place I use anything FB related. Meta has their AI LLM in all their platforms. Like WhatsApp for example.

Zuckerberg spoke of this very recently. But he said that, usually people have maybe 1 or 2 real life close friends. Which may not be enough for each person. But with AI you can have several friends who are AI. 

And they've been doing this with AIs using John Cena, Judy Dench, Kristen Bell, and a couple others. 

They're adding more and will be adding more. I just went to WhatsApp and in the AI chat, when I click on the top right it looks like there are a bunch of AIs there to speak to. 

So that's one plan. To create AI friends on the social media app. 

Another, is AI generated ads. They said this recently as well. Just like how google has Veo2 to generate videos. Meta will have AI generated ads.

Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [Air India Plane Crash](https://apnews.com/live/air-india-plane-crash-ai171-ahmedabad-london)

[**BA (Boeing)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BA&p=d)\-Air India Flight AI171, a Boeing 787‑8 Dreamliner carrying 242 people from Ahmedabad to London, crashed shortly after takeoff on June 12, 2025 due to suspected bird strikes (no longer suspected as the case). Boeing shares plunged \~8% pre‑market as this marks the 787’s first ever crash with total loss. Mainly interested to see if there is some kind of selloff and subsequent recovery. BA always has some selloff when there is a plane crash, but frankly this appears to be a bird strike so mainly a fault of the pilots and not the company (for what we know now).

[**OKLO (OKLO)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OKLO&p=d)\-Announced a tentative U.S. Air Force contract to provide small modular reactor-based nuclear power to Eielson AFB in Alaska. This stock broke ATH yesterday, one of the more interesting levels I was looking at was $60. They immediately did an offering of $400M in stock afterwards, so looking out to see if there's a continued selloff and we cool off.

[**GME (GameStop)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME&p=d)\-Announced a proposed private placement of $1.75B in convertible senior notes after earnings; Wedbush released a note this morning questioning whether GME can replicate MSTR's BTC strategy. Immediately sold off and I'm interested in the $20 level if there's any kind of bounce. Not interested in any sort of long-term hold, more of a day trade.scalp.

* [Call option Investopedia video](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) basically a call option allows you to buy 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price), but without the obligation to buy
* [Put option Investopedia video](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp) a put option allows you to sell 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price), but without the obligation to sell
* Writing options switches the obligation to you and you'll be forced to buy someone else's shares (writing puts) or sell your shares (writing calls)

The market completely ignoring the manhandling and handcuffing of a sitting US Senator for no good reason seems quite ominous, not gonna lie. 

As does Noem's remarks that: “We are staying here to liberate the city from the socialists and the burdensome leadership that this governor and that this mayor have placed on this country.”

If you want to incite mass civil unrest, using the military and DHS to overthrow the duly elected government of the country's second biggest city with zero pretext is a good way to do it. And according to Trump he’s 6’3, 220lbs and the healthiest, smartest and least incontinent president ever ""Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace. In many cases the Criminals allowed into our Country by the VERY Stupid Biden Open Borders Policy are applying for those jobs. This is not good. We must protect our Farmers, but get the CRIMINALS OUT OF THE USA. Changes are coming!""  --Donald Trump

So Potus admits he has lost farmers and hotel workers, but doesn't give a rip.  Nice setup for midterms.  lmao. up like 5.5% ytd, garbage gains. I miss those 20-30% Biden years Do me a favor and sell Google so that I don't have to see you crying about it anymore.

1l9f7w2,2025-06-12,"China’s racing to build its AI chip ecosystem as U.S. curbs bite. Here’s how its supply chain stacks up
U.S.-led export controls have cut China out of critical segments across the AI chip supply chain. 

Many chip experts say this has had the dual effect of incentivizing domestic alternatives in China while also creating challenges such efforts.
In some segments, such as memory,

China has made significant strides in overcoming restrictions, whereas in chipmaking equipment, the barriers are much greater.

https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/12/chinas-racing-to-beat-us-chip-curbs-how-its-supply-chain-stacks-up.html?

How does this impact NVDA and AMD over the long run? 
Basically, it cuts into overall sales.  This, in turn, slows down R&D due to lack of sales revenue that could have been allocated to R&D.

As Jensen Huang said, 50% of AI researchers are Chinese.  So, let's say the revenue decline is so severe that the top AI talent returns to China or never leaves China.

Now you're up the proverbial creek without a paddle. both Biden and Trump were dumb to keep trying to curb China.  Should have bet on American innovation and kept selling them the older chips.  They are basically building the Chinese chip market. Both sides are trying to decouple:

Just a question, I was looking at a handful of stocks just by searching the name of the company and then stock after.

Curious why that is and if that’s par for the course or some sort of unethical practice? 

For reference I had searched Google stock, Apple stock and Vita Co Co stock, all displayed a “quarterly financial” bubble and next to that also displayed an “Earnings” bubble showing their EPS beat vs expected, but when I searched for GameStop’s stock it only displayed the “quarterly financial” bubble no EPS beat despite them showing a 325% beat on estimates?

1l99edd,2025-06-12,"Chime prices IPO at $27 per share, valuing fintech company at $11.6 billion
Chime priced its IPO at $27 per share on Wednesday, above the expected range, in an offering that values the provider of online banking services at $11.6 billion. The company raised roughly $700 million in the IPO, with another $165 million worth of shares being sold by existing investors. The stock is expected to begin trading Thursday under ticker symbol CHYM.

Chime’s decision to go public, even after a steep cut from its last private valuation of $25 billion, marks a major test of investor appetite for consumer-facing finance companies. SoftBank, Tiger Global, and Sequoia all invested in the 2021 round at Chime’s private market peak. The company’s top institutional shareholders are DST Global and Crosslink Capital, which owned 17% and 9.5%, respectively, of shares before the offering.

Chime’s core business, offering no-fee banking services, debit cards, and early paycheck access, draws most of its revenue from interchange fees. The company competes in various areas with fintech incumbents PayPal, Square and SoFi. Revenue in the latest quarter climbed 32% from a year earlier to $518.7 million. Net income narrowed to $12.9 million from $15.9 million a year ago.

Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase are leading the IPO.

If you have anything other than no credit history or shit tier credit the products doesn't make sense. You can see in the S1 they make almost all their money on interchange because they have 0 rewards. Anyone with a stable job and okayish credit history has access to way better options.

1l9454q,2025-06-11,"GameStop Announces Proposed Private Offering of $1.75 Billion of Convertible Senior Notes
GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) (“GameStop”) today announced that it intends to offer, subject to market conditions and other factors, $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2032 (the “notes”) in a private offering (the “offering”) to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). GameStop also intends to grant the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date on which the notes are first issued, up to an additional $250 million aggregate principal amount of notes.

The notes will be general unsecured obligations of GameStop, will not bear regular interest and the principal amount of the notes will not accrete. The notes will mature on June 15, 2032, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. Upon conversion, GameStop will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of GameStop’s Class A common stock, par value $.001 per share (“Class A common stock”), or a combination of cash and shares of Class A common stock, at its election. The initial conversion rate, repurchase or redemption rights and other terms of the notes will be determined at the time of pricing of the offering. GameStop expects that the reference price used to calculate the initial conversion price for the notes will be the U.S. composite volume weighted average price of Class A common stock from 1:00 p.m. through 4:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on the date of pricing.

GameStop intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including making investments in a manner consistent with GameStop’s Investment Policy and potential acquisitions.
GME and shareholder dilution, no one could have seen this coming I’m sure you’ll be shocked to learn that the lads over on superstonk still insist this is a good thing Close stores>dilute apes>buy tbills and btc>repeat until stock is trading at book value I just went and looked at their thread and oh my god. Absolutely delusional talking about how being diluted in favor of new senior shareholders is bullish for them as retail. How generating cash at their expense is actually a good thing for retail holders. They literally will own less of the company, and what they do own is down 15% in a day. Brainwashed doesn't even begin to describe the mental gymnastics. Can someone explain why as a company you wouldn’t want to do this? Can’t gamestop just invested this additional capital in tbills, relatively risk free? Essentially a carry trade or am I missing something? Clearly the business is declining in revenue so what else are they left to do? Invest in t-bills and your cash is relatively locked for a low but secure gain. 

Raising this money they can use the capital more freely and chase a higher return. If they fail to make that return they can just return the cash without interest owed. 

If the offering gets converted into shares I guess they’re happy because it means their shares are worth much more. I mean, the company does have the option to repay the full amount of cash in 2032, it doesnt have to be shares. So 1.75 billion at 0% for 7 years where inflation will eat away at the principle seems like a really good NPV deal to me. Wow lot of haters here.

If someone offered you $1.75 Billion, INTEREST FREE, you would take it too.

So yeah, they made the right move. > with effectively no debt.

Convertible senior notes are literally a form of debt. 🤦🏻‍♂️
It will appear on the balance sheet under long-term liabilities. The terms of the offering are gme can choose to redeem them as cash or shares, with no interest. So on one side it's an interest free loan, and on the other it's a dilution. You don't know and only gme can choose.

How do any of us take out a 0.00% interest loan? They can literally just out it into bonds and net 4-6% interest on up to 2bn at no cost or loss to shareholders.

1l8xc08,2025-06-11,"TSLA Shares Rebound as Musk Steps Back from Trump Clash
So Elon Musk just backed off from his beef with Trump, saying on X that some of his posts went “too far” and he regrets them That’s a pretty big shift after all the drama. Trump, meanwhile, isn’t interested in making up and warned Musk he could face “serious consequences” if he helps Democrats

This whole feud has Wall Street on edge, especially Tesla investors. Tesla’s rollout of its robotaxi service in Austin is supposed to kick off June 22 but there’s worry Trump might use federal regulators to slow things down kind of a political roadblock that could hit Tesla’s growth hard

Tesla shares bounced back almost 2% early Wednesday, recovering some of last week’s losses when the Musk-Trump drama blew up

From an investor’s perspective  how do you see this playing out? Does Musk’s “sorry” move calm the waters enough to keep Tesla on track? Or is the political heat going to keep putting a ceiling on Tesla’s potential?
Robotaxi ""launch"" will be a nothingburger and it'll still go up 10% for whatever reason If any other CEO accused the president of being a pedophile and then days later said, at 3am in the morning, ""forget what I said."" they would be fired as CEO or their stock would be in the shitter, or both. 

Yet, Tesla up again today. 

When this thing eventually goes tits up, I strongly suspect we're goign to see an 80% sell off in a single hour. WTF is trump doing threatening businesses should they support anyone - this is nuts and has become normal Doesn’t he need to secure contracts with city governments for Robotaxi to be successful?

What Democrat-run city government would ever sign a contract for robotaxis with a drug addicted Trump supporter when they can sign one with Waymo that has real FSD? None of that has anything to do with Tesla's issues rolling out CyberTruck, autonomous autos, etc. 

Pissing off the POTUS is of course bad business, especially when the POTUS we have believes in command economics and not a free market. 

But this does nothing to fundamentally change the company. This is to say its a memecoin but listed on an exchange. You do not trade it based on fundamentals, but on the risk. A few cars go set on fire, that’s a drop in the bucket for a billion dollar corporation. 

Just think about how many more people know about Waymo now compared to before that news. It would cost a small fortune to advertise to the same degree. 

Lastly, I really want to challenge your premise that TSLA self driving and Waymo self driving are the same at all. Tesla has been making promises for a decade and will likely alienate many local/state governments with a haphazard rollout.

I truly don’t understand why TSLA carries such a premium for repeatedly announcing a “brand new innovative” service when they’ve already been beat to market. 

Google owns the largest private information network in the world, one of the largest provider of cloud computing resources, invented the foundational techniques to LLM type AI models, and has self driving cars on the road RIGHT NOW. Why are we so stuck on Tesla? This behavior would not be tolerated by a Tesla salesperson at a dealership, but somehow is rewarded with billions in compensation and board approval in a CEO. Well Robotaxi does seem to be cheaper, at the cost of being more dangerous. Doesn’t seem like a sensible tradeoff The last person to short TSLA will make a goddamn mint. >But waymo is limited geography whereas tesla FSD, however incomplete, has driven in all corners of US

The difference is that Waymo has demonstrated they can function safely without a human driver in the areas they're serving, while Tesla hasn't done that yet.

15 and investing?? man I was riding my bike swearing at adults 😔 🤚 good job fella open an account with fidelity, and just buy a mutual fund instead. it's easier to invest straight dollar amounts than buy shares of an ETF, plus a fund reinvests the dividend for you. FSPGX or FXAIX. although i wouldn't worry about this shit until your early 20s. you need accessible money now, not a Roth IRA If you trust your uncle, yes. Let me know if you have specific questions. I would say that depends upon the relationship you have with your uncle. Why not one of your parents? When we say trust right me and my uncle have by far one of the best relationships however what could possibly go wrong? Before you turn 18, or 19 or 21 depending on the state, your uncle would have final say over anything that happens in the account. If you earn money and put it into your custodial IRA and tell your uncle to buy VOO, but he thinks that your money is safer in bonds, it will be his decision, not yours. I am sure your uncle has your best interests at heart, and I trust your read on his character. A bad family member might decide to liquidate the account for their own benefit, and although this would be illegal and unethical, it would be a huge pain to claw the money back from him. I am sure that will not happen, but if you thought to yourself, ""ehh, maybe he would do that,"" it might be worth avoiding. Then I would say yes, assuming you have the earned income.  
Then, separate the account when you turn 18. I thank you very much for looking out however I manage and invest for him!!

It seems both sides are playing damage control and trying to repair the rift. There's been huge discontent from Musk due to Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" but we've moved from 325->275 ->335. MASSIVE move and trade of the month.

[**OUST (Ouster)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OUST&p=d)\-Premarket announcement that the US Department of Defense approved its OS1 digital lidar sensor for use in unmanned aerial systems. Most of the move occurred premarket, but will be watching to see if we make another leg higher- the daily chart looks near parabolic if we move up again today/tomorrow with a move from 7.50 to 20 in the past month.

[**CRWV (Coreweave)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&p=d)\- Staying surprisingly resilient at \~$160, we've also seen upward momentum an hour before the open (154->160). Overall nothing too compelling for a short unless we rocket past 160 to something ludicrous, this has stayed up longer/stronger than CRCL so far more interested in this.

[**ASTS (AST SpaceMobile)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)\-Somewhat still hovering fairly high from Jeff Bezos posting a picture that implied a partnership. This has diverged from RKLB's move up, and is still hovering around $36. Nothing too compelling unless we make a leg higher. Again, nothing confirmed from Bezos or Amazon, so the move may fade if no formal announcement follows.

I think this sub is cooked.

Either it gets brigaded by Trumpers or anti-Trumpers. I get no real info or even advice from those who actually just want to do normal investing.

Yes, I know this is reddit and all but…god damn it, this sub (along many others) has been broken due to politics. So, I’m gonna bounce for good. Amateur hour.

1l8nlc1,2025-06-11,"Tesla: The First Robotaxi Video Shows a Dangerous, Illegal Turn
For context, a Reddit user posted this clip of the first Tesla Robotaxi in Austin: [https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1l855x7/first\_ever\_footage\_of\_tesla\_robotaxi\_testing\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1l855x7/first_ever_footage_of_tesla_robotaxi_testing_in/)

As you can see in the clip, the Tesla begins turning while there are pedestrians in the crosswalk, likely because it is camera-only and does not detect the pedestrians in that specific location.  Instead of waiting for the pedestrians, it instead stops in the middle of the intersection, while making a left turn on a non-protected green.  The vehicle comes to a rolling stop, in the middle of the road, with the passenger side completely exposed to oncoming traffic.  Despite pedestrians being in the crosswalk, the vehicle continues to slowly roll instead of coming to a complete stop, putting the vehicle in the worst possible position of being both in the way of traffic and moving towards pedestrians.  We can also see that the lead Tesla, the Robotaxi, applies the breaks aggressively, with little care or notice as to what or who is behind it.

If this clip was shown to a driving test instructor, and they were told it was a clip of a new driver, that driver would fail the test instantly.  This Tesla managed to put the pedestrians, on-coming traffic, and the vehicle behind it in danger at the same time.  All of this is likely due to Tesla's unique insistence that FSD can be achieved safely with vision only, as Tesla cuts costs by not including a full array of sensors similar to how Waymo works.

I believe this is just the tip of the iceberg.  Musk has ruined his reputation over the past year and the TSLA stock is being propped up by low-volume retail traders that are praying for a future Musk promises, yet never comes.  I feel Tesla has rushed out the Robotaxi program to distract from an incoming terrible quarterly report, and they've clearly done so at the expense of safety.  My best case scenario for Tesla is that the Robotaxi is safer than it seems and struggles to gain market from Waymo, and they fail to add anything significant to the bottom line.  My worst case scenario is that a Robotaxi fails to see a pedestrian and kills them, essentially killing any dream of Tesla Robotaxis in the 2020's.

Full disclosure: I am currently long on TSLQ, an ETF that attempts to match double the inverse of Tesla's daily performance.  For anyone unfamiliar with inverse ETFs, that means I am extremely bearish on Tesla, and have taken a position which will explode if Tesla fails.  My personal feeling is that the Robotaxi launch combined with a terrible quarterly report sometime in July will push TSLA down to the 200 range and TSLQ up 100% or more from current values.  I am not a professional or giving advice though, just my personal feelings.
It could run a red light and hit someone and tsla would still pump IDK it doesn't look that bad from this clip to me. 

The car is already turning at the start of the clip, and already mostly into an oncoming lane of traffic. 

It's not super clear the people started crossing and were visible before the Tesla started to turn. They are crossing from an area obscured by people. Lidar can't penetrate through people either.

It saw the people, slowed and passed safely behind them.

It's also clear from the video there wasn't any nearby oncoming traffic. This is the only bull thesis in my opinion, that Tesla fanboys have an unlimited source of hopium. Good info on the road mishap but be careful shorting Tesla.   Some things in life do not need to make sense. This. The OP is being way too harsh here based on a partial video. I thought I was going to see a much different clip based on OPs explanation. This is a pretty common city interaction on a normal day. Lmao redditors are so desperate, give up, you've lost. ""applies the breaks aggressively"" etc... 😂

This is obviously a one sided hit piece that no one read more than a paragraph of. You over exaggerated everything about what happened in this video. 

Try being a little more objective. What should the car have done? Is the ""brakes aggressively"" in the room with us?

1l8jxrp,2025-06-11,"Google offers buyouts to employees across the company. This trend has started in China and will extend to the western hemisphere
Edit: Again, not saying that it actually started in China, but highlighting that everything is accelerating with AI systems which will define more optimal avenues for efficiency when it comes to workforce and for now some western hemisphere countries were relatively more protected given our labour laws and social safety nets. But with less employees, less savings for retirement or jobless earnings. Many topics /idea mixed below ( that’s the beauty of human brain/rambling vs edited by AI).

https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/11/cnbcs-the-china-connection-newsletter-ai-hits-an-already-weak-jobs-market.html

https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/google-buyouts-search-ads-unit.html

This trend is likely to accelerate within the next 24 months in Usa. With major cuts expected in the NYSE AI listed companies, significant profits can be made. AI teams will be affected too. A tale of a snake eating its own tail and flesh.

But with the size of the China workforce in a country that produces more than one million engineers yearly, and with the expected rise of unemployment and accelerating AI mechanics , we might be at the dawn of a geopolitical shift in china and a redefinition of the power imbalance between low cost production countries and emerging low cost production countries in all continents.

Jobs average lifespan for employees getting lower and lower. From lifetime jobs more than 60 years ago to 1 month lifespan very soon.

For the hard or brick and mortar stuff, wouldn’t be surprised in the near future, if technologies companies which typically don’t pay dividends on consistent basis morph into  structures like REITs ( Real Estate Investment Trusts) and become REITs( Robots Ecosystems Industrial Trusts). You buy a stock of a company owning robots and the entity will pay you monthly dividends; but instead of a bond like return growing slowly, Dividends increase on yearly basis will be more substantial given AI efficiencies. The valuation of these IT companies will be more marketable using the dividend growth model.


The world is cooked and I feel for the new generation America is already laying off engineers left and right for 3 straight years already. That is next quarter's problem Imagine if every company does this, cutting jobs to boost profits. Who is going to buy their products? They are not pricing in economic downturn, civil unrest or the rich being back on the menu. Voluntary buyouts are good for employees, but not a good deal for shareholders. Generally, the people that take buyout offers are generally the most skilled employees that won't have problems finding work elsewhere(IE postdoc AI researchers), or highly tenured employees with lots of knowledge that use the opportunity to retire early. Mediocre employees aren't going to take a buyout, because trying to find a tech job in this economy is very challenging(even with big tech on your resume)

Google is going to lose a lot of their best talent at a time when they desperately need talent to catch up to their competition. Additionally, they will take a 1 time charge associated with the buyout package. I'd say this is quite bearish. And when everyone and their mom is a plumber, HVAC, and electrician? Plumbers and electricians Started in China? Are you kidding? Wide scale layoffs and buyouts as we know them were invented by American MBAs in the 1980s. I feel this has already started.

1l8bd4a,2025-06-10,"GameStop Stock Slides as Sales Decline
GameStop (GME) shares fell in extended trading Tuesday as the retailer's quarterly revenue declined.

The video game retailer's revenue dropped 17% year-over-year to $732.4 million. The company swung to an adjusted profit of $83.1 million, or 17 cents per share, from a loss of $36.7 million, or 12 cents per share, a year ago. However, adjusted earnings were down from the $136.4 million, or 30 cents per share, GameStop reported a quarter earlier.

GameStop shares slid about 5% in after-hours trading. The stock was down 4% for 2025 through Tuesday's close.

GameStop also said it has not bought any additional bitcoin (BTCUSD) since last month it disclosed the purchase of 4,710 bitcoin. The company did not reveal the purchase price at the time, but that amount of the cryptocurrency would be worth nearly $516 million at its recent price near $109,500. In March, GameStop said it was planning to issue $1.3 billion in convertible bonds for ""general corporate purposes,"" including buying bitcoin.

Actually hilarious their most profitable segment, and what looks to be the only reason they are cashflow positive, is just the 6 billion in cash sitting around collecting interest. You know a business is booming when they would make more just liquidating everything and just sitting on treasuries lmao.



But hey who cares about a retailer investing in growing stores or product offerings when they can just ... *checks notes* ... buy bitcoin and sell NFTs lol?


Edit: already getting spammed with Reddit Cares reports after 10 minutes. That has to be a new record. Stay classy, apes. Unfair write up. 
Firstly, of course q1 is down from q4. Retail is seasonal. A +83m from -36m is extremely good.
Secondly, sales declined only because unprofitable stores were closed, improving balance sheets and overall profitability.

Edit to add following:
Yes gamestop is currently increasing profits due to their cashpile, but how fast do you all expect this company to grow? It was at deaths door only a few years ago, and was able to produce a very large cashpile. It has only put half a billion in btc, as a hedge against cash. Love or hate btc, id favour it to the dollar these days and a lot of companies and countries are seeing this.
Gamestop has beaten estimates earnings after earnings,  got full year profiability, and have now had 4 profitable earnings and counting... they have been gaining momentum in sales again- just look at recent nintendo sales. Mark my words, next earnings will be even better It got $6 billion in cash by diluting retail over and over. CEO has no vision other than to collect money on T-bills and buy BTC about four years too late. They’ve been closing unprofitable stores and divesting overseas, so revenue is down, but net income is up. No debt, with $6.5 billion in cash…. The cash pile keeps them profitable with a slight operating loss. Overall decent earnings. Well this shows both OP and you know nothing about the company lmao. The convertible bond is done last quarter. No new bond has been offered Lots of people still around who can’t admit they got pumped and dumped back in 2021. This company is having a major identity crisis. Core business model has had declining sales for years with no plans to turn it around. A $6B cash pile raised through dilution and not being deployed because they have no strategy. 

When in doubt, pivot to BTC. It's becoming the hospice for failing companies. Superstonk sub celebrates every quarter when the company’s revenue goes down. It’s insane what a cult that place is. So where is the long term value?

1l8bcct,2025-06-10,"GM to invest $4 billion in its U.S. manufacturing plants
General Motors today announced plans to invest about $4 billion over the next two years in its domestic manufacturing plants to increase U.S. production of both gas and electric vehicles.

The new investment will give GM the ability to assemble more than two million vehicles per year in the U.S. This announcement comes on the heels of the company’s recently announced plan to invest $888 million in the Tonawanda Propulsion plant near Buffalo, New York to support GM’s next-generation V-8 engine.

Plants in Michigan, Kansas, and Tennessee will expand finished vehicle production of several of GM’s most popular vehicles:

* **Orion Assembly, Orion Township, Michigan**: GM will begin production of gas-powered full-size SUVs and light duty pickup trucks at Orion in early 2027 to help meet continued strong demand. As a result, GM’s Factory ZERO in Detroit-Hamtramck, Michigan will be the dedicated assembly location for the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV, Cadillac ESCALADE IQ, and GMC HUMMER EV pickup and SUV.
* **Fairfax Assembly, Kansas City, Kansas**: Fairfax Assembly will support production of the gas-powered Chevrolet Equinox beginning in mid-2027. Sales of the recently redesigned Equinox were up more than 30% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2025. Fairfax remains on track to begin building the 2027 Chevrolet Bolt EV by the end of this year. GM expects to make new future investments in Fairfax for GM’s next generation of affordable EVs.
* **Spring Hill Manufacturing, Spring Hill, Tennessee:** GM will add production of the gas-powered Chevrolet Blazer at Spring Hill starting in 2027, alongside the Cadillac LYRIQ and VISTIQ EVs, and the Cadillac XT5.

It's just an announcement remember folks 1. Announce billions of investment without any legal commitment to follow through
2. Receive positive press coverage and gain favor with the current administration 
3. Never actually implement or significantly cut back on the plans announced 
4. Profit Believe it when there are a good chunk of actual people getting decent paychecks from jobs in those plants. Isn't everything seemingly An announcement to pour money into US manufacturing plants, no doubt they’ll be automating labor and reducing human capital costs. 

Notice how they didnt say how many jobs they’re adding anywhere in the press briefing? Ask the folks that fell for this in Trump’s first term. They committed 4 billion to tooling Orion to an EV factory in 2022. Could just be for show. Ironic they are investing the same amount 3 years later. This.

1l8an4a,2025-06-10,"Taiwan Semiconductor’s May sales jump 39.6% as AI demand stays strong
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), the primary chip supplier to Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL), reported a 39.6% year-over-year rise in May revenue as clients rushed to stockpile chips amid growing trade tensions.

The company generated NT$320.5 billion ($10.7 billion) in revenue last month. While this marks a strong annual increase, it's an 8.3% decline from April, when TSMC saw a sharper 48.1% year-over-year gain.

Revenue for January through May 2025 totaled NT$1,509.34 billion, an increase of 42.6% compared to the same period in 2024.

Looking ahead, analysts project a 50.3% Y/Y increase in TSMC's second-quarter sales, signaling continued robust demand despite month-over-month volatility.

TSMC chief executive and Chairman C.C. Wei said last week that the demand for the company's AI chips continues to outweigh supply.

The chipmaker reported strong Q1 results in April and issued a positive outlook for the coming years. ""We continue to observe robust AI related demand from our customers throughout 2025. We reaffirm our revenue from AI accelerators to double in 2025,"" said Wei on the earnings call.

1l82scp,2025-06-10,"Apple + OpenAI and Meta+ Scale vs. Palantir…
Not really sure, but how does Apple's OpenAI integration play into the enterprise AI race? I know it's mostly consumer-facing for now, but long term… could it lead to broader LLM adoption in enterprise workflows? And if that happens, does it overlap with what Palantir is building through AIP?

Also wondering: if OpenAI continues releasing API tools that let you build custom agents really easily, and those agents can interact with company data and perform actions — wouldn’t that start to affect Palantir projected TAM?
Turns out effectively no one uses ChatGPT integration with their iPhone, since 99% of people don’t need it when an app is right there Name one Apple innovation since Steve Jobs died. It is a (high loyalty) Consumer Discretionary, not a Tech company. If you aren't a government employee, you should prevent them from automating your job for as long as possible

Or at least pretend it's still you doing it and not tell anyone you get AI to do it I concede! Good one. M1-2 chips? Time will tell who is correct. But overall I agree. It is not a tech company in the same sense as the others Now that OpenAI is releasing a Gmail integration…all they’d need to do is release a Salesforce integration and I could automate like 90% of my job 🤣 🤘 Lmao bro - everyone at my company already knows AI is THIS close to be being able to do half our jobs.


At this point, we are actively working to us AI to massively increase everyone’s productivity so we don’t have to hire as much.


At the end of the day, we’re still a good ways off from Ai Being able to totally replace employees….but there is no sense in hiding and acting like that isn’t going to happen at some point, and so instead, I’m proactively going out and figuring how to use AI to make me way more productive and valuable to any org I join 🍻 I think the total addressable market will only get larger. That's what's happening right now with the data center buildout and the widespread concern about availability of energy essentially acting as a cap on growth of AI more broadly.

But I do agree with you that Palantir will see competitors to Foundry and AIP that will challenge their moat. That isn't something the groupies want to hear, but it's obviously going to happen. There are probably dozens of these projects underway at companies large and small.  Palantir right now has the first mover advantage though, so they are still a good bet.

1l80l6z,2025-06-10,"Will robots be the next smartphone?
Tesla appears to be undervalued given its potential to revolutionize the field of robotics for both business and personal use. Stock prices on Wall Street are based on expectations for the future; we must consider what the robotics world will soon look like.Robots have become an integral part of the automotive and semiconductor industries, but mass-produced autonomous robots could have a significant impact on society and Tesla stock.Despite personal concerns, the arrival of advanced robots seems inevitable and it is worth considering future investment opportunities. 

Will Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) robots be the next smartphone device for the mass market? Will they have the same impact on society as smartphones? In this article, we'll look at the robots Tesla is developing and whether we can profit from this potential shift.

To some extent, Wall Street bases its judgment on future profit expectations for stock prices. When we think about future prospects, we have to think about what the world will look like in 3, 5, or 10 years and what will happen to stock prices? This is obviously a very difficult question to answer, but we can make reasonable predictions about the overall growth of the emerging humanoid robotics industry.

Ignoring the risks posed by AI and robots to the survival of the species, we can probably assume that the short-term risk is that China will continue to dominate Chinese EV sales, and that Tesla could face a very tough time in the Chinese market. However, global sales of electric vehicles continue to grow. However, as EVs continue to grow, Tesla will need something to differentiate itself, and that's where self-driving cars might come into play. I guess we'll see if that will fully materialize, and for now, it looks like advanced testing will take place in Austin, Texas. Let's move on to the next issue.

China has a monopoly on rare earth elements used in Tesla robots and electric cars. The U.S. government needs to break that monopoly by heavily funding domestic resources. According to Reuters, President Trump may be on the verge of passing the Defense Production Act to fund critical and rare earth elements. Of course, we are currently in the midst of various political waves that are clashing between Elon and President Trump. Trying to predict what will happen between the two of them is futile as they are both unknowns, but it's just something to be aware of. Another risk factor is that Tesla currently has a lot of production in China. If relations with the U.S. deteriorate further, there could be repercussions. That's an unknown to keep an eye on.

I think Tesla Robotics as well as solutions from NVIDIA, Amazon and China are on their way and will materialize in the next few years. Regarding the potential market size, according to a Reuters article, NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said, The age of robotics has arrived. People are paying attention. This is likely to be the biggest industry.



So will humanoid robots become as popular as smartphones? I think it's possible, and if we look at how Elon is transforming Optimus Prime in the factory, we'll have a clearer picture of the future in a few years.
Tesla undervalued…too funny The ones that had to be operated by human pilots? Those robots?? 

Tesla is not the play in this sector imo. I don't see it. This is some premature hype.When smartphones came out, it took a bit to catch on with the masses. They were too expensive and the bills were outrageous since the infrastructure was still relatively young. But they had a market. They had a need to fill. The average person will struggle to justify spending thousands on a robot. To do what? This is some luxury item for now. Just my opinion. Will check back in a decade or so. If Tesla nails humanoid robots even close to how Apple nailed the iPhone, we’re talking about a multi-trillion-dollar market shift. Optimus could be the hardware platform of the next decade. Still early days, but worth watching. Tsla appears to be undervalued. I stopped reading after that sentence.

I can tell you don’t do any real DD. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-06/tesla-s-leader-of-optimus-humanoid-robot-program-leaves-company Tesla is far from the only company developing this tech. They are priced like they will dominate this area and they won’t. 

It won’t be a winner takes all/most situation. There won’t be an iPhone equivalent because robots are functional. Phones are status symbols. 

Sure some rich folks will have status symbol robots, but it won’t be an every day thing where you feel like you need/want an Tesla robot. You will go for best deal. The personal robot stays at home unlike a car, phone, watch, or other status symbol items. 

Anyway, to say they are undervalued is insane if Tesla nails humanoid robots, then they get self-driving for free.

The robots will just step into the driver seat and be able to drive any car. Explain please...What am I delusional about? You'll have to be more specific. Do you mean Grimes in a spandex suit doing the hokey pokey or the ""high school project I got a C on"" one? ABB made more useful robots than that in the 1990s. What is Tesla doing that ABB can't do? Not many will want a robot at home that looks like a human and spy one everything you do or say and report back to big data. The few who might still want one can get one from Boston Dynamics, who are way ahead of Tesla

1l80cp6,2025-06-10,"Could OpenAI use Google Cloud? What does this mean for GOOG stocks?
Hey guys just read the news about goog that OpenAI is in talks with Google Cloud to possibly migrate some of its AI training loads from Microsoft Azure If true, what will this do to the stock of Google's parent company Alphabet (GOOG)?

Let's start with the reasons why OpenAI might be moving to Google Cloud:

I think it might be to avoid vendor lock-in: OpenAI doesn't want to be tied to Microsoft Azure alone, especially if Microsoft's supply of arithmetic power can't keep up with demand  

Competitive pricing: Google Cloud may offer more competitive pricing on TPU/GPU resources, especially since training large models is extremely costly

Technology differentiation: Google's TPU v5e and Vertex AI may be more efficient than Azure for certain AI tasks

What would be the benefits to Google if they did move to Google Cloud?

Cloud business growth: if OpenAI does migrate some of its loads, Google Cloud revenues will directly benefit AI-related demand could accelerate

AI ecosystem strengthening: we all know that Google has already invested in Anthropic (ChatGPT competitor) adding OpenAI would further strengthen its AI infrastructure position

 Sentiment Boost: Investors have been worried that Google is falling behind Microsoft in the AI race, and this deal could ease that anxiety and boost the stock price.

The favorable impacts of the above are indeed many but there are still many potential factors:

We need to understand that Microsoft is still the biggest owner of OpenAI: it has invested tens of billions of dollars, and it has first right of refusal to commercialize OpenAI technology.69 Even if it uses the Google Cloud, Microsoft will still be able to take a cut of OpenAI's revenue.

Regulatory risk: If OpenAI and Google get too close, the antitrust agency could get involved.

How will the market react?

Short term: If the news is confirmed, GOOG may jump 3-5%.

Long-term: It's critical to see if Google can use OpenAI to close the AI gap with Azure Currently, Microsoft is earning a lot of eyeballs by integrating Bing/Office with ChatGPT Google is in dire need of the same level of AI use cases

Guys what do you think, will GOOG take off as a result or will Microsoft remain on the AI throne?
[deleted] Interesting development. If OpenAI shifts some load to Google Cloud, it could definitely boost GOOG's cloud revenue. But Microsoft’s deep ties with OpenAI still give them a strong edge. The rumor is that the margins on hosting OpenAI workloads are very slim or even negative, which is why Microsoft voluntarily gave up their exclusivity contract with OpenAI and then cancelled datacenter expansion plans. Maybe GOOG pops in the short term if such a story is confirmed, but I don't think it's as lucrative for them as you'd think. Im wondering if google by having its own TPUs instead of buying so much outsourced ones could do it for cheaper because they could probably benefit from the partnership otherwise You forget that google has a much more better optimization for transformer based architecture with there infrastructure because they invented it then heavily invested in the infrastructure.

Azure sucks but google with there tpus can possibly make ai cheaper to run. We saw openAI cut the cost of there o3 model by 80% to gemini levels of cheap. If this deal was discussed in may and signed for already we can already be seeing the benefits by openAI offering the models more cheaper than when stuck with azure.

So cheaper models, means you can serve them more which means more money which means more money for cloud etc etc. As opposed to other players who are ONLY buying Nvidia? If anything Google is best positioned because they have 2 options for AI accelerator chips, not one provider like everyone else [deleted] 1. Microsoft’s original deal in 2023 was struck before the compute boom. Very cheap pricing. 
2. Google doesn’t sign deals without substantial profits, especially from a competitor. 
3. Google has a desire to show it’s not anticompetitive. Providing compute to competition is a way. OpenAI clearly doesn’t think DeepMind is behind in research. https://blog.lmarena.ai/blog/2025/search-arena/

Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [Zuckerberg Recruits New Superintelligence AI Group At Meta](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-10/zuckerberg-recruits-new-superintelligence-ai-group-at-meta?srnd=homepage-americas)

[**CRWV**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&p=d)\-DA Davidson released commentary suggesting their pro forma had underestimated its debt situation while not properly accounting for borrowing costs. This stock is ridiculously run up since IPO (\~4x it's opening price). Daily setup doesn’t look like a clean short, but watching to see if it mimics CRCL’s recent surge at the open yesterday. Interested in seeing if it breaks the highs ($166). Obviously CRWV has a huge debt load due to their GPUs/training chips, but whether this will actually affect the stock price remains to be seen.

[**TSLA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\-Musk/Trump tensions have cooled down and Trump publicly stated that they will keep their White House Starlink. This happened about 30 mins before the close and caused TSLA to shoot up a little, and ASTS/RKLB to sell off. TSLA was extremely interesting the day of the feud, but currently I'm minorly long.

[**ASTS**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)**/**[**RKLB**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RKLB&p=d)\-Part of the broader spaceflight stock rally that began earlier this week, mainly due to Jeff Bezos implying a partnership through a picture with ASTS. Has been on a tear for the past 3 days, might have topped out yesterday. Wasn't this watching this too closely because I was trading CRCL but still interested to see if this makes a higher leg up. Yesterday was the most interesting day for this and RKLB, but if this breaks highs again today then I'll be interested.

[**CRCL**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&p=d)\-Strong run post-IPO has made this the most interesting stock this week outside of TSLA. Very likely we topped out yesterday but watching for additional momentum. Keep in mind that this is mainly ""C"" money + the hype of a recent C stock and IPO success of CRWV that has propelled this higher (it is a solid business model as well)\_. I think the momentum in this has deflated (we surged briefly off the open and then sold off for most of the day).

[**AAPL**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\-Intraday selloff yesterday came as excitement over the “Liquid Glass Design” underwhelmed, revealing more of a UI update than hardware innovation. WWDC tends to be a ""sell-the-news"" event.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

1l7s9t3,2025-06-10,"Zuckerberg, Frustrated by Meta’s “Slow” AI Progress, Personally Hiring New “Superintelligence” AI Team


Mark Zuckerberg, frustrated with Meta Platforms Inc.’s shortfalls in AI, is assembling a team of experts to achieve artificial general intelligence, recruiting from a brain trust of AI researchers and engineers who’ve met with him in recent weeks at his homes in Lake Tahoe and Palo Alto.

Zuckerberg has prioritized recruiting for the secretive new team, referred to internally as a superintelligence group, according to people familiar with his plans. He has an audacious goal in mind, these people said. In his view, Meta can and should outstrip other tech companies in achieving what’s known as artificial general intelligence or AGI, the notion that machines can perform as well as humans at many tasks. Once Meta reaches that milestone, it could weave the capability into its suite of products — not just social media and communications platforms, but also a range of AI tools, including the Meta chatbot and its AI-powered Ray-Ban glasses.

Zuckerberg aims to hire around 50 people for the new team, including a new head of AI research, almost all of whom he’s recruiting personally. He’s rearranged desks at the company’s Menlo Park headquarters so the new staff will sit near him, the people said, asking to remain anonymous discussing private plans. 

Zuckerberg is building that team in tandem with a planned multi-billion dollar investment in Scale AI, which offers data services to help companies train their models. Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang is expected to join the superintelligence group after a deal is done. Bloomberg News first reported on the deal, set to become Meta’s largest external investment to date. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment.

Zuckerberg has spoken openly about making artificial intelligence a priority for his company. In the last two months, he’s gone into “founder mode,” according to people familiar with his work, who described an increasingly hands-on management style. 

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-10/zuckerberg-recruits-new-superintelligence-ai-group-at-meta

Coz Google is going crazy rn. Can't they just ask an LLM to do it? It's about to replace programmers right? But wait. Zuckerberg told us a few months ago their AI model was about to reach mid level engineering mid this year. We reached the timeline. Where is it? Yeah they are shoving AI results down everyone’s throat on every search. web traffic is gonna go down considerably. So google results is just stolen content “AI” and ads He's learning from Elon. Promise big, never deliver. Don't ever talk about Meta verse again. You'd think he would have learned something from his metaverse quest. 


AI won't do jack for social media except drive people off it. The near future of AI is in backroom productivity gains.  I’m getting to a stage where I would like to see less AI, or AI solely where it can actually solve problems. I don’t personally understand why does my WhatsApp have AI, that I don’t want to use and can’t even remove I don’t have much belief they’re going to win the AI race but I think that they’re going to use someone else’s and apply it to IG, WhatsApp, FB etc.

The one good thing to say about Zuck is that he failed quickly with the Metaverse. I mean to go so into it that you call your company “Meta” and then bail less than a year later requires serious courage. It reached senior level and then retired. anyone not working on AI is being treated as bullshit by execs who all have drunk the AI koolaid. Amount of bullshit being peddled everyday is enough to fertilize the entire planet When did they bail on the Metaverse? Spend on Metaverse in Q1 2025 is $15bn. In Q1 2021 it was only $8bn.

1l7ihe4,2025-06-09,"Meta Set to Throw Billions at Startup That Leads AI Data Market
Meta is considering investing as much as $10B in AI data company Scale AI, a company they've helped finance in that past to a current tune of $14B.

Created by two founders in their late 20s, Alex Wang and Lisa Guo, Scale AI has sold digging materials to gold miners, using an ""army of contractors"" to label the data that tech firms such as Meta and OpenAI depend on to train and improve their AI models.

Should the financing come to fruition it would become one of the largest private fundings of all time. Although forced out in 2018,  Lisa Guo's stake, due to the company's current valuation, makes her the world's current youngest female billionaire.

What does the sub think of this? Is this Meta making moves to get out ahead in the AI arms race? Or is this another seemingly desperate pivot from a social media giant concerned about future irrelevance?

1l6ma12,2025-06-08,"DocuSign $DOCU ($75.28) -19% Sudden Crash and the IAM Story (IAM Analysis)
DocuSign's core offering is pretty simple. It is an e-signature company. Google Docs, Adobe Sign are pretty much offering the same thing and they have enterprise offerings too.

Well, that changed about a year back. DocuSign is transitioning to the next phase. Into *Intelligent Agreement Management* (IAM).

DocuSign IAM became the fastest growing product in the company's history. More than 10,000 customers have adopted IAM. They processed tens of millions of agreements.

So, what is IAM exactly and what problem does it solve?

Corporations are facing ""Agreement Trap"". Nearly $2 trillion in global economic value is lost annually due to poor agreement management. Most companies are stuck managing contracts with Word docs, email chains, and file folders. Important contract info gets lost, renewals are missed, and everything takes forever.

IAM reads your contracts and pulls out key info (dates, dollar amounts, terms), sends renewal reminders, gives you insights on your contract portfolio. This is an AI powered solution and they are using AI contract agents to help with this.

Companies are seeing 70% faster onboarding, millions in cost savings, and 75% efficiency boosts.

It's their big bet on becoming more than just the ""e-signature company"". They want to own the entire contract lifecycle.

They are seeing early success:

* KPC Private Funds saw customer onboarding time savings of 70%.
* Velatura identified an estimated $82M in annual cost savings
* Catchafire doubled contracting capacity across their sales and legal teams.
* Metro Credit Union boosted operational efficiency by 75% in the first 4 weeks of using IAM.

Despite this progress, the stock crashed 19% after June earnings on billing guidance concerns. This could be market overreaction creating opportunity. Two days before earnings, someone bet $71,000 that $DOCU would crash below $80 within 48 hours. They were right and made a lot of money! This suggests that the selling pressure was from informed players who are now likely done.

Right now, if $75 holds, price is likely to revert toward $84 as panic cools. Watch for early reversal signs, especially into Monday’s open. But if it drops to $72 it could go down even lower. Again, this is for a short term play.

**Not Financial Advice. Do your own DD.**
This write up is a good reminder that the majority of people love to hear themselves talk.  Most of this ""Due Diligence"" feels like it was taken from marketing materials prepared by Ducusign themselves.  If you talked to any number of actual customers you would likely hear a different story about the usefulness of CLM Plus, and I suspect the 10,000+ number is purely a technical statistic and not the number of customers actually adopting the functionality. There is no moat, and they are easy to replace. The AI management systems that companies are investing in will do all of these functions in-house for free. They invented the computer signature. It's not protectable. > Despite this progress, the stock crashed 19% after June earnings on billing guidance concerns. This could be market overreaction creating opportunity. Two days before earnings, someone bet $71,000 that $DOCU would crash below $80 within 48 hours. They were right and made a lot of money! This suggests that the selling pressure was from informed players who are now likely done.

What, if anything, “suggests the informed players are now likely done”? This reminds me of an LMS platform I was working for for about a year. They would go out and promote the sheer volume of API calls and exclaim proudly that it showed tremendous growth. 

Only to find out the marketing team ignored the fact that there was a difference in customer API calls and internal dev API calls and just lumped them all together. They road that wave for over two years. IAM was already known as Identity and Access Management before DocuSign started using it. They already committed a marketing misstep right out of the gate. Trust him bro This. They are up against companies like Salesforce with no clear advantage I own a business that was using docusign, they chased me off by upping their fees beyond orbit on me.

1l6kpu4,2025-06-08,"25M Learnig finances, is my plan any good for a 5 or 10 years?
I'm currently building a long-term investment portfolio with around $15,500 in USD. My approach is to combine strong exposure to tech and innovation with some international diversification. I've selected individual stocks like NVIDIA(15%) and AMD(10%) to capture growth in the AI and semiconductor space, and I've included TSLA(10%) as a way to gain exposure to the EV and energy transition sectors—though I'm open to switching that position for aerospace and defense in the future, depending on market conditions.

To complement those, I'm using the Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF (15%) for broader exposure to leading U.S. tech companies. I've also added the Franklin FTSE India ETF (10%) to capture long-term growth potential in emerging markets, particularly India. In addition, I've chosen a cybersecurity ETF (RIZE CYBR) (10%) to position myself in a sector that's increasingly critical, and I’ve added a biotech ETF along with Moderna(15%)to diversify into healthcare innovation.

Besides this USD portfolio, I hold 10,000 euros in the Vanguard Global Stock Index Fund. I plan to add 75 euros monthly to this fund, while saving another 75 euros each month as cash on the side, to take advantage of opportunities within my main portfolio or strengthen existing positions when there are dips.

Lastly, I’m keeping around 35,000 euros in cash, which I plan to hold in a high-interest savings account or similar low-risk vehicle, with full liquidity in case I decide to make a property purchase in the near future.

This mix allows me to stay invested in sectors I believe in, while maintaining flexibility and liquidity for both opportunities and personal needs. Open to thoughts or suggestions on how to improve it.

\*Edit: 

My current main questions:

1. Can all this markets go up during 4 and a half years but suddenly on the 5th year go down? What's the point then holding long term? 

2. The longer you hold, the less a ""break down"" can affect your portfolio? For example: A general 40% down will make you lose money on year 5 but you will be ""strong enough"" at year 10 to still being positive eventhough the breakdown? 

3. I know ""time in the market > timing in the market"" but do you think it is a good week/month to enter? Nvidia for example is super high right now. 

4. If you hold for 10 years, but there's a big loss on year 10. Does that mean all those 9 years have been useless and you gotta start again? 

  
Sorry if the questions are too noob and thankyou for the feedback. 
[deleted] Very tech heavy could leave you exposed. Diversify a bit more instead of focusing on mostly tech This - you’ll never pick stocks as well as the market. Answering your questions:

1. Let's say your investments compounded10% annually for the first 4 years, then a correction hits. We'll use $20K as your initial investment: Yr. 1 = $22K, Yr. 2 = $24.2K, Yr. 3 = $26.62K, Yr. 4 = $29.28K. In 4 years, your initial investment has increased $9280 or 46.41%. If on year 5 the market drops 20%, you investment drops to $23,424. You are still in the green.
2. Yes...I believe the historical history of the S&P 500 has shown that holding for the long term (20+ years), the probability of you being in the green is 100% (hop on youtube and search for the ""Moneyvest"" channel, the host mentions that on many of his podcasts)
3. Given the previous fact, ""now"" is always a good time. If you follow the markets, it is always advantageous to deploy more cash into the market when the VIX is high. The dips that you are worried about on your first question is when you deploy a larger portion of your money into the market.
4. No....see the example I provided in mi first answer. If we take that 5th year (from 1st example) and continue the 10%/yr of compounding for the next 4 years, then year 9 you would have $34,295.08. That's an increase of over $14K from your initial investment. You would not get that type of return from a HYSA, or any other conservative investment. If on year 10, the market has a 20% correction, you would have $27,436.06. Your initial investment would up 37.18%.

That 10th year (any time the market has a correction) is an opportunity to load up on your favorite stocks/ETFs (deploy more cash). 

Since no one knows when a 20% correction will happen, your questions are hypothetical. I will tell you that in the last 10 years, the S&P 500 has had a 20% correction twice (this coincides with your hypothetical). In the last 20 years, the S&P 500 has had a 20% correction only 3 times, and in the last 30 years, the S&P 500 has had a 20% correction 4 times. In the last 40 years, the S&P 500 has seen a 20% correction 5 times (about once every 8 years). Meaning, your initial investment would be much higher (over those longer periods of time) than my simple example. 

Also, my example only depicts you depositing money initially (1 time). If you deposit multiple times (like maybe $100 or even $50 every month or every Friday), then your returns would be considerably higher. This would also allow you to take advantage of any smaller dips in the market throughout any given year.

Here's a link to an online compound interest calculator: [Compound Interest Calculator | Investor.gov](https://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/compound-interest-calculator)

 If you enter $20K (initial investment) and contribute $100/mo. for 40 years compounding 10%, annually (w/1% variance), then you would end up with $1.4 million.  Again, no HYSA, CD, or treasury bond would give you these types of returns. It’s all your opinion but a balanced index fund has historically been fine. 

There will probably be a correction in electric car companies. My personal opinion is that they are still a car company and they aren’t worth as much as their stock is at.

We may have already missed the big growth for semi conductors. 

Also you talk about long term growth then you say 5/10 years? That’s not necessarily long term. 1. Totally possible. There is no rule. 

2. The idea of buy and hold is 2 fold. If you sell in profit, you need to pay tax. Now you have idle cash and lost a bit in tax. Those tax dollars could give good returns when compounded over a long time frame. Also now you are trying to time the market. It can keep going higher after you sell and grind lower after you buy. With buy and hold you avoid both headaches.

3. You can learn basic technical analysis. It helps with some degree but not always. Best time to buy individual stocks is when they reach rsi 30 (oversold) for no big fault of them. (scandal, c suite retiring, missed earnings) Nvda reached rsi 30 last year due to SMCI f\*ck up, delayed release of blackwell and recently due to tariffs. The issue is these are rare. You may wait for something that never happens (2017 and 2021 had no rsi 30 events for big names)

4. Yup! SNP returns from 2000 - 2015 were minimal or 0. If you adjust for inflation its negative returns. Thats why they say SNP never fails in a 20 year period (when one such event happens they will increase the window to 25 ;D) 

Its better to keep bulk of your money in SNP and QQQ. With individual stocks you have 3 issues - how much to invest (% size), when to enter and exit. It is difficult for you to come up with an asset allocation mix that will beat SNP every year. This year NVDA might shine but what about next year and there after.

Also stars of today can be dead tomorrow (think of covid stars - twilio, zoom etc) they are way down today but SNP has chugged along higher. If you bought nvda at 10 its a great buy now its well known so how much higher can it go. And one earnings miss it can get crushed. 

Also I dont think AMD will recover. Hyperscalers are going for either NVDA or their own in house chips. There is no demand for AMD chips. How can you ask those questions and think you're savvy enough to pick stocks and sectors?

In 10 to 20 years you'll eventually get to witness how all your predictions play out and realize that you are more wrong than right. Eventually you'll end up being just another index investor, just like all the people giving you that advice right now. This is just how I see it: with only 15k, investing in the stocks you mentioned will likely yield positive returns after 10 years. But the real question is, will you get rich? The answer is no.

So instead, either invest in something that generates cash flow (so you can leverage it to get a loan), or consider crypto or small-cap stocks. Look for lesser known/small AI companies. AI is the future. 

I also see investing as a long-term journey at least 25 years. During that time, consistently adding money is key, as it allows your investment to compound faster. With smart choices, you can definitely build significant wealth over time and always look for ways to diversify.

1l6iklq,2025-06-08,"Moderate risk stocks with higher returns.
So i feel like im late to investing at 33 years old and want to start investing more aggressively for the first years to catch up a little. Any advice on which stocks you think should boom for a few years with a bit higher risk than ETFs?

EDIT:
Thank you all, I understand your concern and while my goal later is definely to invest primarily in VOO, i think for the first years i could afford to invest in some more volatile stocks with a bit higher growth than spy.
I think you mix up volatility with profits

Just cause a stock is more volatile, for whatever reason, doesnt mean they will outperform the rest.. and if we all would know which one is going to moon *for sure*, we would only hold those

At 33 your not too late. In fact, its never too late, but there are no real shortcuts either in investing

So I recommend, either simply buy a ""normal"" broad market index, e.g. VTI or VOO and keep at it, or you try and really go the brutal route with investing in trading firms - Imma get downvoted just for that last part tho, so stick with the index funds.. That kinda thinking will put you ten more years behind. Be careful. Worst attitude I've ever seen.

""I want to start more aggressively to catch up"" is just ""I'm about to dump my money chasing quick gains by taking big risks while I don't know what the fuck I'm doing"" ASTS ASTS. Satellite cell phone service. This is and will be a very competitive space simply due to the market size of literally billions of customers. Whoever wins this race will make a lot of millionaires. I like ASTS due to their patents and head start in this race. Currently holding 1100 shares, average price of $2.60. Hopefully it’s not wishful thinking. Well since nobody is actually answering your question.

PLTR
RKLB
HOOD
AMD
UNH

I'm doing GEV as well. Just determine the risk and you want and be prepared to lose a chunk of money. I invest aggressively just in my RH account and it's paid off significantly since 2019. I usually buy my main stocks on dips and do option calls on sharp declines with my winners (primarily PLTR and NVDA). 

The grandpas on this stock reddit recommending ETFs for somebody specifically asking for stocks is silly since thats not what your looking for. Find a couple winners you think will do well in the long run and stick to them. I came here to say this too. No one is answering the question.

If you want to take your hand at more risk, imo ASTS is the best single risk/reward stock I can find. Rocketlab is cool too but its just easier for me to envision AST’S path to billions in fcf. In 2027 I expect ASTS to print. It’s definitely baba technically, according to asset pricing theory, a volatile stock should yield more though because you need to be compensated for the risk. That’s why bond yields are lower than equities. No offense, but it's kind of a silly/catch-22 type question... you want someone to predict for you what's going to happen. **Higher risk** potentially has higher reward.

At 33, it's not too late. Most people have little to no experience investing and have no business picking individual stocks.

1l6hqhm,2025-06-08,"Looking for Quality Growth Stocks Trading at a Discount – What’s on Your Radar?
I’m not really a value investor, but I do try my best to find high-quality growth stocks when they’re trading at a discount—usually this ends up being in the mega- or large-cap space, regardless of market conditions.

For example, I added Meta back in 2022, picked up MSFT in the $410–$380 range earlier this year, UNH between $330 and $270, and AMD around the $85–$95 range. Still averaging into Google.

Are there any similar opportunities you think are worth keeping an eye on through the rest of the year?

Novo Nordisk most definitely. However, its a bit tricky since they recently fired parts of the C-suite incl CEO NVO, UBER, AMZN, AMD, ASML, GOOGL I think RDDT is a good one. It's around $120 and it's one of my favorite social media apps. It could be a good time to buy it if it continues to grow Those are extremely speculative stocks though.

1l6dktt,2025-06-08,"Meta reportedly in talks to invest over $10B in Scale AI — long-term strategy or another costly pivot?
Recently, it has been reported that Meta is in advanced negotiations to invest over 10 billion dollars in Scale AI. Scale AI is a company renowned for providing data annotation services, which are crucial for training large-scale artificial intelligence models, including those used by OpenAI.

This potential investment has raised many questions:

Is Meta attempting to establish an internal foundational model system in order to reduce its reliance on external suppliers such as OpenAI and Anthropic?

Does this mean that the focus has shifted from the attention to the metaverse to the emphasis on artificial intelligence infrastructure and vertical integration?

What kind of impact will this have on other stocks related to artificial intelligence? For instance, stocks like $NVDA, $PLTR, or $SNOW?

Given Meta's past performance in major investments, some investors might view it as yet another high-risk bet; while others might see it as a strategic response to the AI competition among large technology companies.
This is what we call “buy high, pray higher.” 🙏📈 Is this sub just blatant ChatGPT? OP didn’t even delete the follow up prompt at the end. Based on meta’s historical performance this will have little to no impact for the ai industry or themselves as a whole.

Just look at the metaverse or the disastrous llama 4 model debut that completely butchered their reputation. Arguably the only thing that meta has “recently” created internally that was a success is Facebook marketplace.

Outside of that they have only had success outside of facebook by acquiring businesses that were growing and seeing success initially without them (see instagram, WhatsApp, oculus) 

I don’t see this investment do anything more for them in the AI space. The Ray-bans are being used as cameras and sometimes headphones. It's not this flag planted for the metaverse. Also, 1 million is kinda sad. The iPad sold 1 million units in a month. Shoutout to all the Boomers buying chinese t-shirts from FB Ads who are funding Zuck's cash pyres lol AI slop for peddling AI slop companies. > And wait until the government comes for them.

No paywall: [https://www.investopedia.com/what-to-expect-in-markets-this-week-may-inflation-data-apple-conference-gamestop-earnings-11749224](https://www.investopedia.com/what-to-expect-in-markets-this-week-may-inflation-data-apple-conference-gamestop-earnings-11749224)

News from a tech giant, inflation data and earnings from a meme-stock legend are among the highlights of the week ahead in markets.

Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference opens the week with a keynote session from CEO Tim Cook scheduled for Monday. Cook will likely use the event to address the company's new products, services, and partnerships. GameStop could clarify its cryptocurrency strategy on the company's earnings call, set for Tuesday. Key companies in the growing artificial intelligence (AI) market are also scheduled to update investors on their financials during the week.

A U.S. inflation report scheduled for Wednesday could indicate whether President Donald Trump’s tariffs are beginning to have an effect on the economy. The news follows a healthy jobs report Friday.

After markets shook off trade tensions last week to bring the S&P 500 back above 6000, investors will keep an eye on tariffs as Trump’s deadline on trade deals approaches. At the same time, the Senate will continue to work toward passage of Trump’s “Big, Beautiful” budget bill amid increasing criticism from Tesla CEO and former Department of Government Efficiency Chief Elon Musk.

# Economists Look for Inflation’s Impact in May CPI Report

Wednesday’s expected release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be the first look at inflation from May. With a Federal Reserve meeting around the corner, the report could set the tone for the central bank as it faces pressure from Trump to lower interest rates. Fed officials are in their blackout period ahead of their next two-day meeting, which begins June 17.

Trump’s tariffs will be a key topic in Friday’s consumer sentiment report, which dropped for four straight months before leveling out in May. Consumers are consistently worried that tariffs will drive inflation higher, sending the closely watched survey to some of its lowest readings since the pandemic. As inflation has lately appeared in check, the freefall in sentiment may have hit bottom.

# GameStop Reports As It Jumps into Bitcoin Market

GameStop’s (GME) earnings report comes as the video-game retailer dips its toe in the cryptocurrency pool. The company, which fired up the meme stock craze in 2021 with its meteoric rise, announced in late May that it bought $500 million in bitcoin. With its retail video game business in decline, GameStop looks to emulate the playbook of Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR) and other companies centering their business models on buying bitcoin.

AI will be a key theme in other corporate earnings this week. Oracle’s (ORCL) report on Wednesday follows the January announcement that the database software firm would join ChatGPT maker OpenAI and SoftBank as part of a joint venture known as Stargate to build AI infrastructure. Adobe’s (ADBE) report on Thursday is also expected to focus on the company’s sales of AI-enhanced graphics software.

This one is easy, all the stocks I own will be red, all the ones I don’t own but have been keeping an eye on, will be green Treasury Inflation Protected Security

The most basic explanation is that TIPS bonds pay out lower rates of interest, but the principal that the interest is calculated from is adjusted for inflation or deflation. So, using simple numbers. Assume a 1% interest rate and you buy a $1,000 bond. If there is zero inflation for the year, you'll receive $10 of interest ($5 every 6 months, as they pay out their interest twice a year). 

If there is 10% inflation, the principal on your bond is recalculated to $1,100, and you will receive $11 in interest that year. 

If there is 10% deflation, the principal on your bond is recalculated at $900, and you receive $9 of interest that year.

When the bond matures, you receive either the higher, inflation adjusted principal or your original investment, whatever is larger. If there is net deflation, you receive your original principal (that is, if you buy it for 1,000 but, by the time it matures, due to deflation it is worth $900, you will still get your original $1,000 back, but if it inflated to being worth $1,100 then you get the full $1,100).

So you are trading a higher return for protection from inflation. Again, the examples above are just using round numbers, 10% inflation or deflation isn't exactly realistic, and it's more complicated because it pays out twice a year so 10% yearly inflation doesn't necessarily mean 10% higher interest received (what if it's flat the first 6 months then skyrockets to 10% the second 6 months), but just using simple numbers for explanations sake.

*EDIT* Protects --> Protected and other grammar fixes I don't have the time to read the post. But I can assure you there is no plan. I've no doubt we hit ATH before July tariff reprieve ends. This is a bull market and stocks want to go up.  My plan is to sell everything before second week of July at high prize. I'm an European and I know how stuff works here. There is no deal to be had. European position is basically that USA gives up on it's tariffs and then we can talk. It is also possible that i'm wrong.

1l5vyh4,2025-06-07,"Earnings up, yields up   is Trump’s $3T bill a bull trap in disguise?
Everyone’s watching the Musk vs. Trump drama like it’s the main event, but markets should probably be paying more attention to what’s actually in Trump’s $3T “big beautiful bill”  because it’s very much alive and moving forward

Despite Musk calling out GOP lawmakers, threatening primaries, and warning about the deficit (which, by the way, multiple analyses say will balloon by $2.4T+), the bill’s still on track. Thune and Senate leadership basically shrugged him off. They’re pushing this thing through  and fast

Here’s where it gets interesting from a market angle:

They're talking about cutting back the $40K SALT deduction to save money. But whatever they save might immediately get canceled out because there's also strong pressure to make temporary business tax breaks permanent  stuff like R&D deductions, bonus depreciation, and interest expensing

That’s a huge deal if you're long big-cap tech, industrials, or healthcare. These tax breaks boost reported earnings pretty directly. If they go permanent, EPS estimates probably move higher without companies having to do anything operationally. Think MSFT, LMT, UNH  names like that

But here’s the tradeoff: the bill’s already inflationary. If they don’t pay for it, bond yields are going to feel it. So while stocks might get an earnings tailwind, valuations could stay capped or even compress further if the 10Y starts creeping above 5% again

And the AI provision buried in the bill? Wild. Originally it said states couldn’t regulate AI for 10 years — a total federal preemption. Now they’re walking that back to a softer “you lose broadband funding if you pass certain laws” version. Doesn’t matter much fiscally, but for megacaps like NVDA and GOOG, this is one less regulatory headache. The moat just got a little deeper

One curveball that could raise the cost: Section 899. It lets the president slap taxes on foreign countries seen as ""discriminatory."" Some senators want to remove it, which could limit future revenue and geopolitical leverage. Not a today problem, but if you're watching defense and energy stocks tied to foreign trade, it matters

And now there's infighting about Medicaid cuts. Josh Hawley’s out here writing NYT op-eds saying this bill punishes working-class voters while handing corporate tax cuts. He’s not totally wrong. If the GOP starts shifting back toward economic populism, how long do these business-friendly tax policies actually last?

So here’s the real market question buried in all this: Are we about to get an earnings boost that the bond market completely wipes out?Because if you’re buying the earnings upgrade but ignoring the debt story  you might be trading the right trend with the wrong multiple
It's Bannon's Flood the Zone.

He said media are too stupid to follow more than one thing. (I don't think it's stupidity, but it is working.)

Want to pass a $3T disaster, Have a big loud fight with Musk for people to focus on.

Until yesterday, I hadn't heard about Abrego Garcia in a long time, and the media has totally forgotten about the other 237 shipped to El Salvador with him.

Flood the Zone. It works. Back toward economic populism? Republicans were never economic populists. That's just their propaganda pitch to voters. They never actually helped the working class, the poor, the sick, or the elderly.

Their actual policies have always been taxes for the working poor and tax breaks for the rich, and that's what their big beautiful bill is, and why most of them support it. I buy your hypothesis and I'll add that currency devaluation will add to the problems imho. Wasn't that one of the ideas pioneered by that German politician Joseph Goebbels? To the folks who thought a serial bankrupter would *fix* things, this 🍺 is for you Shit, you can track a very large chunk of modern propaganda techniques back to Goebbels. One of the most evil and manipulative people to have ever existed, I can't imagine what bullshit he could've sold with social media. The BBB is not the bull trap. The bull trap is people truly believing AI will slow walk us into the Star Trek future (at least with the types of valuations companies with AI products and AI adjacent products are getting that’s basically what’s being priced in).

1l5mw0h,2025-06-07,"My Thesis on TSLA ($295.14) and CRWV ($140.16)
***This is a multi-signal analysis***, built by synthesizing options flow data, sentiment, company fundamentals, and technical structure. I'm focusing on setups where multiple signals converge. Not just one off price moves or just pure TA.

We all know about the Elon Musk vs. Trump drama that's playing out in public. On June 5, $TSLA dropped nearly 14% in a single session. That was its largest one day drop since March 2020.

This wasn’t a move based on earnings or fundamentals. It was event driven and sentiment driven. And it came with record put volume. There were over 4 million contracts traded. This is pointing to either panic hedging or high conviction short bets. That kind of volume typically leads to short term dislocation.

On June 6, TSLA rebounded +3.7%, showing early signs of stabilization. That bounce came on strong volume, which adds weight to the reversion thesis.

**Entry Zone:**  
$285–$288 is a key support zone. A clean hold or reclaim above $300 with volume reactivates the bounce thesis.

**Target Zone:**  
$305–$318, especially if the political overhang fades and sentiment resets.

**Danger Zone:**  
Avoid entries if price retests below $280 without reversal. This could lead to further downside.

Now looking at CoreWeave ($CRWV):

CRWV IPO’d in March and ran from \~$57 (May 13) to \~$163 by June 4. This was a 185% move in just three weeks. That’s a classic parabolic extension.

It pulled back on June 5 to \~$135 and closed June 6 at $140.16. So far, this looks more like the first real cooling off period than a full reversal.

Options flow is mixed. There's still aggressive call activity at $150–$160, but we’re also seeing increasing open interest in the $130 and $120 puts. That split usually signals uncertainty. Some still chasing upside, others starting to hedge or fade.

**Entry Zone:**  
Watching $130–$134. That was prior resistance and could act as support if price compresses there. If it reclaims $145 with strength, the setup for a retest of the highs becomes viable.

**Target Zone:**  
$155–$160, but only if price gets back above $145 on volume.

**Danger Zone:**  
A breakdown below $125 likely triggers a deeper unwind. Watching $114–$118 as the next volume shelf.

**Conclusion:**  
TSLA looks like a higher confidence reversion setup. The size of the flush, the record flow, and the bounce all point to a dislocation that can snap back. CRWV is more speculative. It's a momentum name cooling off after a vertical run. It's tradable, but only with confirmation.

Would love to hear how others are approaching these. Especially if you’re tracking the same flows or setups.

***Not financial advice***
This is straight up gambling not investing. There's zero fundamentals in your ""analysis"" To be fair to OP, Tesler stock doesn't give a flying fuck about fundamentals. So you're essentially just following other traders who are much smarter than you and then you're packaging it as your own 'analysis'. K. Stopped reading after ""fundamentals"" I like to look at it like a dope fiend just spit in the face of a Mafia Boss. You might think it's gonna blow over, might get real quiet as far as headlines and tweets, but it's not gonna end well for Elon. Tesla back below $100 is not a meme. You might get RSI resetting here and there and retail will be dumb enough to ""Taco Trade"" or ""B3Lieve iT Or N0t, CaLLz!"" But stick a fork in Elon. Trump will make sure he is no longer richest man in the world. Nah. Would you or anyone you know buy a Tesla anytime soon? Do you want a robot butler that can’t stand without a support? Especially one that’s a ripoff of Boston dynamics circa 2015? Do you want to invest in a company that wastes money on useless ventures like the cyber truck? More recalls than new model releases? 

Sometimes you need to look at the business along with these numbers. Tesla is trashed. It’s sad. Waste your money I guess. Imaging using technical analysis on tesla.  Tesla is having huge problems, cratering sales and a destroyed brand. Psychology and the last gasps of the Musk aura are the only reason it's still trading over $100. Parsing data doesn't work in this situation.

No progress is made, but Trump says ""trade talks going well"" and the market wholeheartedly believes it. I don't know what is dumber?  Two grown men over 40 fighting...

Or losing a fist fight to Scott Bessent. I just want to formally thank Elon and Orange Monkey for that priceless soap opera they performed for us last week, for free. Trump admin will say ""talks were promising"" and SP500 will hit ATH.

You heard it here first. That your/Reddit's feelings and presumed common sense don't matter to the stock market.  
Not sure why so many people here refuse to learn this lesson.

The statement: ""I think the SP will climb to 8000 before the next major crash (which doomers will miss anyway)"" seems to provoke a lot more people than ""Next month this clownmarket is starting a bleed down and reverting to a sane P/E"".

1l57sog,2025-06-07,"My inability to follow my intuition has cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars
I messed up last year and even when I know the fundamentals of a stock are sound, I don’t invest.

I’ve built a strong intuition over the years. In the early 2020s, I trusted it and went all in on NVDA with $40k—and it turned into hundreds of thousands. But then I got cocky. I listened to my brother-in-law (never again), invested in a stock without doing research, and lost $70k. Since then, my confidence has been tainted.

I dedicate myself to rigorous research, spending hours each day on relevant reading. While some may claim I’ve made poor investment choices, that’s simply not the case. I’ve studied The Intelligent Investor along with several other books recommended by Warren Buffett, treating them like a college curriculum—complete with notecards and in-depth analysis. My investment strategy blends both value and growth principles.

My family have come to know I make good recommendations, so they ask me would I would buy:

* my brother asked so I recommended Palantir at $20. He’s up 500%.
* my friend asked so I recommended Vista & Constellation Energy, and NuScale. All up huge.
* my uncle asked so I recommended MicroStrategy at $150. Up 147%.
* my brother-in-law asked so I recommended CoreWeave—he’s up 139%.
* my sister asked so I recommended the Circle IPO via Robinhood—up 167%.

Meanwhile, I’ve just been sitting on the sidelines, scared of losing more, stuck in analysis paralysis. That $70k loss deeply affected my self-image.

Has anyone else been through this? Lost big and then lost your confidence? How did you get it back?

I’m disabled and have severe chronic pain throughout my body. It’s not just investing that I have a hard time regulating…. It’s life itself. I constantly have fight or flight emotions coursing though my veins. I think EMDR is probably the answer im looking for.

EDIT:
Just wanted to update everyone! Three days ago, I took the advice from some very helpful Redditors and invested $10,000 across SMR, CCJ, and OKLO. So far, they're performing nicely! 😊

To those who were kind and supportive—I’m genuinely grateful for your insights. You've helped me start rebuilding my nest egg.

To the negative folks, maybe next time try a bit of empathy, especially towards someone already dealing with emotional and physical pain. It makes a difference.
Wonder how many are missing off the list that went up in smoke.

Getting strong vibes of selection bias. Sounds like you need to buy VOO/VT/Etc and find a different hobby Exactly this.  Everybody remembers that one stock that they thought about buying one day 10 years ago, and then it went up 800%.  Nobody remembers the other stock they thought about with equal seriousness the very next day which tanked and got delisted, and was never heard from again.

Everyone's a genius with 20/20 hindsight. lol don’t be taking credit for their investments. Their money, their choice. Just like it was your choice to listen to your brother in law. Sounds like you suck at investing and got lucky with nvidia Have you tried getting a dog and just, putting money into a 401k?  Seriously.  What knowledge and rigorous research?  And what does summa cum laude in comp sci have to do with stocks?  A bunch of these are borderline meme stocks.  Don't ever tell friends and family to buy specific stocks - especially if it's stuff like Palantir and MicroStrategy. 

Everyone thinks they're a genius in a bull market. Damn the way you’re just speaking of yourself is so negative bro, one mistake ? lol I sold PLTR at $7 and btc at 9k. Sold several eth at $200… Take it to the chin and move on dude /thread >I do about 5 hours of investing research per day.

1l56hgo,2025-06-06,"This is a disaster of epic proportion”  Trump vs. Musk turns into a $150B Tesla bloodbath
Anyone else watching this Trump vs Musk drama and thinking... wtf is Elon doing?

Tesla just dropped 14% in one day  wiped out $150B in market cap  after Musk started trashing Trump’s new spending bill on X. Called it “disgusting” and “pork-filled.” Trump clapped back, then Elon basically said Trump wouldn’t have even won the election without him

Now everyone’s freaking out. Investors like Ross Gerber are calling it a “disaster,” saying Elon made this mess by getting political in the first place. And let’s be real killing EV tax credits would be a huge blow to Tesla

TSLA bounced a bit on Friday (+3.7%) but it’s still way down from earlier this week. Morgan Stanley is still bullish (lol), $410 price target and all that

But man… Elon used to be the hype. Now he’s beefing with a sitting president, and Tesla’s stock is paying the price
> wtf is Elon doing?

A lot of ketamine He's right though- It is a disgusting pork-filled spending bill. & telling the truth for the moment, while it suits him He told everyone he’s cool with pedos if they give him what he wants.  Not the flex he thinks. musk doing a great job of pissing off absolutely every potential customer. should have thought this through before getting involved with trump All the other shit that's got nothing to do with spending like adding power to the executive branch and not letting states regulate AI for a minimum of 10 years and other stuff is kind of worse than the spending parts of it that will add Trillions to the debt and deficit. Half the country said they were cool with pedos if they give them what they want. I knew things were going to be bad if Trump was elected to a 2nd term,  but I never could have imagined how embarrassing the office of President has become. This is like two middle school kids shouting at each other. You guys keep posting about Tesla like it's this magical company that prints money. 

In reality, it's a stock that is way over hyped, and is high purely based on meme. In Q1 of 2025, they earned only $19 billion in revenue, and worse, only $409 million in net profit. Their market cap was $1 trillion then. They are probably going to finish Q2 in the red because of dwindling sales. Their P/E ratio was about 181 last week, and this week it fell to 151. For those who don't know, a P/E ratio is equivalent to how long it will take your annual earnings off of your share to recoup how much you purchased the share for, aka, a P/E of 10, means it will take you 10 years to earn back the price of your share, so 151 means it's abiut 151 years before you earn your money back for how much you paid for the share. The higher that ratio is, the more overvalued the company is. 

Ford, which has a market cap of $40 billion had Q1 revenue of $40.7 billion, and net revenue of $471 million with a P/E of 8.22. Honda does even better with a P/E of 7.82, and they were down 9% in revenue compared to last year. 

So, by comparison, Tesla is grossly overvalued. Their cars suck. Their CEO sucks. And they are finally catching up to where they should be, which is a Market cap of about $20 to $60 billion, at best, technically lower since they have always had lower sales than all of the other car companies.

1l55ub9,2025-06-06,"Amazon is the blood of AI
If artificial intelligence was a human body, Amazon would be the veins, blood, and heart.

Amazon circulates not only packages through the physical economy, but data, as I'm sure you know. Without the blood, the brain (NVDA), cannot function. Every sizable company depends on Amazon in some way or another. 

AWS, okay-- google cloud and azure included, are perpetually undervalued because the investor looks at expenses. I look at it as an infrastructure.

I got in on AMZN 164 shares \* 184 avg. I bought positions in MSFT and GOOG to hedge a bit.

Amazon, however, will be my biggest holding for my entire life most likely. Of course, I do not know, but I see it as more probable than improbable. 

It cannot transport its connection. Amazon is going to be the greatest investment of my generation (born 2002)

This is not just logistics, its logic
Amazon bag holder. 40$ 80$ 120$ 160$ and on and on. 50% of my portfolio is amazon. Obviously, or you would have never written this glazing ass post Amazon is older than you. It's already been one of the greatest investments of a prior generation. Msft, AMZN and goog are correlated so I don’t think that’s a good hedge That's quite a lot of mixed metaphors. NVDA is the brain? 

AWS is all ""google cloud and azure included"". How many AI blood types are there?

Azure has the largest growth of new gen. AI and LLM workload, and Google is growing faster than AMZN in the same space. Amazon does have a large infrastructure, but the new growth is coming more from the other two. I don't think Amazon's Bedrock will touch OpenAI or Gemini long term. 

It will probably be a great investment. The best of a generation? Time will tell, but I doubt it will touch Berkshire's 5,502,284% return. Amazon is down 3% YTD

Why invest when they're other better stocks out there? Amzn is the second largest position in my port. Sorry I can’t reply my buddy Jeff is calling me My man, Amazon is priced at 2 trillion dollars.

1l51bzx,2025-06-06,"China Trade Deal Next Monday - Could This Be a Game Changer for the Market?
The agreement could bring clarity on tariffs, supply chains and maybe even some strategic partnerships With both countries under pressure to resolve ongoing trade tensions, the deal might ease investor concerns and restore some confidence in global trade  
  
Companies like AAPL NVDA and INTC could see movement due to trade implications. A favorable deal might give these companies the green light for continued business operations in China, potentially boosting their stock prices

Chinese consumer demand could get a significant boost especially for companies with exposure in the region like NKE or SBUX However if the deal falls short of expectations those stocks could take a hit 

 Even though we’re all hoping for a positive agreement the market could react negatively if the deal is underwhelming or doesn’t address key issues like intellectual property or market access. In addition, this trade deal could bring forward inflation concerns if the economic impact is stronger than expected

I'm personally looking at **tech** stocks next week If the deal brings positive sentiment I'm expecting a short-term rally in these sectors However I'm also hedging my bets with some **puts** on broader indices in case the deal disappoints and causes volatility

Anyone else planning to make moves based on this Are there any specific stocks you think will get a major bump if the deal is good
Market already is acting if there is no tariffs at all Tbf, if the liberation tariffs were left in place it would've been extremely bad. Weren’t you the guy that sold everything in Jan, but didn’t buy anything when the market dropped 20% and was betting that it was going lower? There were like 1000 of those guys here. A lot of people were claiming it would be worse than the Great Depression, just give it a few more weeks. Technology stocks to rely on the agreement “life”? What's the point of fundamentals? If a vague agreement can make NVDA rise another 10%, it shows that the market has been completely detached from the fundamentals, purely on faith [deleted] If the policies were left in place at that time it would have been very bad.

I hate comments like this because people look at something bad, say “that’s bad”, then bad thing changes or stop happening and we get comments like this during “see nothing was bad”. This is how we get people in power who try to put 40% tariffs on our trading partners   It’s a talk, not a trade deal. Trump could put tariffs to zero in exchange for rare earths, but I think China will demand zero tariffs as table stakes to discuss any deal at all with deal negotiations to commence in the fall and a deal by 2029-30 (assuming the deal follows how negotiation to deal works in 99.99% of trade deals) Yep.


And had we actually traded at 5700 the day after and acted as normal, those tariffs wouldn't have been removed.

1l4tzh5,2025-06-06,"Musk Blinks First in $34B Tesla Meltdown Amid Trump Feud  What’s Next for $TSLA?
So... Elon Musk just lost $34 billion in net worth in one trading day after his public feud with President Trump sent $TSLA into free fall (down as much as 18% intraday, closed down \~12%). A record $153B in market cap gone.

This all started when Musk began trashing Trump’s “big beautiful” tax bill, especially the part where it axes the $7,500 EV credit, which could hit Tesla’s bottom line by $1.2B (per JPM estimates). Musk also wasn’t happy that Trump pulled NASA chief nominee Jared Isaacman, a Musk ally.

Then came the *X wars*. Musk basically implied:

Trump owes him the 2024 win.   Trump’s EV policy flip was betrayal.     Trump might be in the Epstein files. (Yes, he went there.)

Trump hit back hard — said he ""helped Elon a lot"", implied Musk was forced out of the White House role, and even threatened to pull federal contracts (SpaceX/Tesla have gotten $22.5B from gov since 2000).

Musk eventually blinked. After watching Tesla tank and people like Bill Ackman urge de-escalation, Elon replied, *“You’re not wrong.”*  
Translation: wave the white flag, at least *for now*.

Will Trump really cut off Musk from federal $$$ — and what does that mean for SpaceX and Tesla’s future margins
And people really believed this duo when they said Musk was leaving politics Musk tacoed out even faster than Trump. I can't stand the constant ""billionaire loses X billion"" posts whenever a stock temporarily dips. Reddit is full of claims that Zuck, Bezos, or Musk 'lost' billions (misleading non-savvy people to think this is a static loss as if they had billions in their bank account and suddenly they don't), even though their net worth keeps rising in the long term and those 'losses' are just short-term market cap fluctuations. It's a misleading narrative.     

Some examples from over the years:

You'd think they've lost negative infinity dollars with the way they 'lose' hundreds of billions so often. Isn’t Bill Ackman one of Elon’s alt accounts? What I wonna know is, where are the robo-taxis? Trump and Elon agreed for Elon to call him a pedo a few times? politics is too advanced for me.

1l4s5f5,2025-06-06,"WWDC 2025 is next week  Can Apple finally deliver something real in AI?
Apple’s big developer conference kicks off June 9, and Wall Street is *watching closely* — especially with the AI hype still going strong.

Last year, Apple teased us with “Apple Intelligence,” their own take on generative AI. Big demos, big promises... but not much follow-through. Siri still isn’t GPT-level, and most of the AI features we *did* get have been kind of meh.

So what should we expect this year?

Here’s a quick rundown:

 iOS/macOS/iPadOS are getting a major design overhaul, reportedly inspired by the Vision Pro’s visionOS. Mark Gurman says it’s the biggest visual revamp since iOS 7.

 AI features in smaller doses  like an intelligent battery manager that learns your habits, and live translation for AirPods (finally catching up to Google). But don’t expect ChatGPT-style magic just yet.

 Apple might open its own LLMs to devs, allowing on-device AI apps. That could be a big deal long-term if devs jump in.

 New unified gaming app  looks like Apple wants to get serious about gaming. Still miles away from console-level stuff, but their App Store is already a mobile gaming monster.

Also, the iPhone 17 is rumored to be thinner and lighter**,** and paired with the new OS could help reignite sales in China  where Apple’s been struggling for a few quarters now.

Bottom line: Apple might not blow minds like last year, but if the software updates are slick enough and the AI stuff feels *usable*, it could be enough to get AAPL back in the good graces of investors.
I’m sure they have some stupid and useless like Genmoji. Is there anything real in AI  though?  Unless it's actually ready to be rolled out in the next iPhone, unlike the stuff that they promised last year that was still in development. 

They've actually been sued over false advertising for the AI promises they made last year. Big innovation lately is to push ai processing to the user's device, so the ai company can save cost on ai server. Apple sells boutique devices, so makes it easier to sell customers edge compute devices, and have customer eat the energy and hardeare wear n tear cost. Nah Apple? Lol no I think the big excitement of AI for companies is the massive potential to replace employees and cut costs, but they can't say that part out loud so they've been scratching their asses on how to make a meaningful AI product for consumers. for Apple, just marketing SIRI as powered by AI isn't enough. redesigning OS isn't getting many oos and ahhs. raising the pricing of iPhones isn't going to be a crowd pleaser. thinner phones is so 2015. theres less and less of reasons for people to upgrade even with those still on the 12. apples only strong revenuer grower has been subscriptions, and none of this changes that. Apple will no longer be at the forefront of AI, but it will maintain its own tech stack. This doesn’t mean Apple products will be any less AI-powered, they will definitely use the latest available technologies. Nope! They've always been behind the curve.

1l4s3ef,2025-06-06,"(06/6) Trump, TSLA, IPOs, and Rockets! Interesting Stocks Today.
Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [Musk Blinks First in Bitter Trump Feud That Cost Him $34 Billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-06/musk-blinks-first-in-bitter-trump-feud-that-cost-him-34-billion)

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Elon Musk/Trump were in a public feud/argument on Twitter yesterday, and the threat of TSLA's government contracts being cancelled was brought up by Trump. Looking for the second day trade in this- we saw TSLA go to a low of $275 yesterday, so I'm interested to see if we continue selling off or make at least some attempt at recovery. Trump/Musk are expected to speak today to ""cool things down"". This spat is mainly political, another issue to add along with the rest. Musk did threaten to stop work on the Dragon Capsule, Trump threatened to stop all of TSLA/SpaceX's government contracts, causing the stock to fall 50 points throughout the day.

[**VERA (Vera)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VERA&p=d)\- VERA fell 30% after competitor Otsuka reported superior Phase 3 trial results for its IgA nephropathy drug, sibeprenlimab, which achieved a 51.2% reduction in proteinuria compared to Vera's atacicept's 46% reduction. We had seen VERA actually spike up due to their drug report a few days back from $20 ->$37 on this news- it's possible that it'll just stay flat at pre-drug release price.

[**CRCL (Circle)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&p=d)\- Watching the $100 level for potential breakout or breakdown. I regret not writing a DD for this but I was taking a break. We opened at \~2.5x multiple to the original IPO price and surged past $100 briefly in the first few minutes of trading, we've stayed pretty strong/sustained up since then. I'm interested to see if we can stay fairly at this level. I'm mainly interested in this because CRCL is one of the first listed stable C's on a US listing, and we've seen HUGE interest in recent catalysts that are related to this space/industry.

[**ASTS (AST SpaceMobile)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)\- ASTS surged over 13% amid speculation of a potential partnership or investment from Amazon, following social media posts featuring AST's CEO and Jeff Bezos. AMZN is beginning commercialization of its Project Kuiper initiative, a satellite-based project that will deliver retail wireless broadband to Earth (competitor to Starlink). There was a research report released that speculates ASTS's RF wireless service could complement Kuiper's broadband technology, and therefore make sense for an acquisition by AMZN. Regardless of how plausible you think an acquisition this is, this was driven all by a single picture and speculation. So be careful of volatility if nothing happens.
Unfortunately, one of the important indicator in the stock market is the current administration behavior and what Trump would say. Where’s rocket labs lol Yep, on the other hand, this is an opportunity thank you for the crcl call :) I agree, but it makes for great trading opportunities!

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1l4nkwf,2025-06-06,"$GOOG is successfully transitioning from a search company to an AI company
For years, we've known Google as the king of search. But if you think that's their only game, you're missing the massive shift that's happening right now. The idea that Google's money will soon come from a lot more than just search isn't some far-off prediction—it's already happening.

Sure, search still pays the bills. But Google is aggressively building its future around some seriously impressive AI, and it's all starting to pay off. What really sets them apart, though, is their secret weapon: the power to weave their best AI, Gemini, directly into the Google search bar everyone already uses.

# Google's ""Unfair"" Advantage: Upgrading Search for Billions

This is the kicker. No other AI company, not even OpenAI, has this kind of advantage. Google can take its powerful Gemini AI and plug it straight into its search engine. Imagine, instead of just typing keywords and getting a list of links, you have a conversation with a super-smart AI that gives you direct answers.

Google can slowly shift billions of us from the classic search page to this new AI-powered experience. They don't have to find new users; they're already on Google's homepage. This means Google can test, learn, and improve its AI with more data than anyone else, creating a feedback loop that will be almost impossible for competitors to catch.

# So, is Gemini Actually Better Than ChatGPT?

That's the big question. While people love to debate which AI is ""smarter,"" it's a bit more complicated. Both are incredibly good, but they have different strengths. The key for Google is that Gemini is getting really good at being accurate and not ""hallucinating""—which is the creepy AI habit of just making things up. You can't have an AI powering the world's search engine if it's spitting out fiction. So, Google's obsession with factual accuracy is exactly what's needed for the next generation of search.

# It's Not Just Search, Though. Google's AI is Everywhere.

Google's game plan is much bigger than just upgrading its main product. They're building entire businesses around AI:

* **A Personal Expert for Your Documents (NotebookLM):** This might be one of the coolest, most useful AI tools out there. You feed NotebookLM your own documents—reports, articles, class notes, whatever—and it becomes an expert on *only that information*. It will summarize, answer questions, and even give you citations, all without pulling in random stuff from the internet. It’s a game-changer for anyone who has to wade through a lot of text.
* **Self-Driving Cars Are Here (Waymo):** While a lot of companies are still just talking about self-driving cars, Google's sister company Waymo is actually doing it. With millions of miles driven on real roads, their cars are already on the streets of several cities, operating as a ride-hailing service. They are, without a doubt, the leader in the self-driving race, which could be a monstrously huge business.
* **The Powerhouse in the Background (Google Cloud):** All of this AI magic needs a ton of computing power, and that's where Google Cloud comes in. Its revenue is skyrocketing (up 28% in one recent quarter) because thousands of other companies are paying Google to use its powerful infrastructure to build their own AI tools. It's a classic ""selling shovels in a gold rush"" strategy, and it's working beautifully.

This kind of massive pivot isn't new, and the smartest companies have done it before. Look at Apple. It went from being a computer company on the ropes to the most powerful force in mobile by seeing that the future was in devices like the iPod and iPhone. Or consider Netflix. It started as a DVD-by-mail service and made the terrifying decision to blow up its own profitable business to lead the charge into streaming. They knew that if you don't disrupt yourself, someone else will. What Google is doing right now is playing from the same book. It's using its current strength to build what comes next, ensuring that as the world changes, it will be the one driving that change, not just reacting to it.
Too tired of those AI generated posts. Yup... this one even got the double whammy. AI slop **and** Google.

Nevertheless, the joy now is in waiting for OP to deliver the classic line of ""I just used it to edit my content and format it"". And it certainly wasn’t made with Google’s AI Genuine question, what makes you call things AI generated? I've seen quite a few posts (not limited to this sub) called aI sLoP when they are pretty normal. If this was posted in 2020, I don't think anyone would think weirdly of it

The Magnificent Seven giants—Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)—have historically been a strong force in driving U.S. market gains.

1l44vgg,2025-06-05,"European defence industry
Very new to investing but I've been deeply interested in defence situation in Europe since the start of Ukraine war and I watched defence spending and contracts closely. Now it seems that share prices are at all time highs for many defence companies, especially after recent news, but still sites like tipranks and investingcom advise to buy, for example Rheinmetall stock, even though the RSI is above 70. As I said I'm new so sorry if my question seems simple, but could anyone help me understand why that is? I would assume that after hype from EU spending announcement dies down there will be some sort of correction in the short term.
You can buy the EUAD etf that’s been up a lot for me this year. SHLD is good for global defense. The momentum is there now for both, but it does not mean it’ll keep going up forever.  Monitor global geopolitics closely and adjust your holdings accordingly. Yes. Buy. Every time someone says that it has peaked and every time it goes up more. I bought rheinmetall in january when people said it was late and sold at +135% a month ago and later it went up by 200 eur per action... Rolls Royce is great . UK stocks Generally when there's some kind of news around the war in Ukraine these stocks move a lot, so maybe consider that when evaluating an entry point Indra Sistemas - still lagging its peers You can Buy Leonardo, Rheinmetall, BAE, Mildef Group and Saab, Best of the best and a lot of growth coming for these companies ! STRONG LONG !!! What I'm really asking is: Is the price inflated due to the news and hype, or does the price already reflect all of those big annauncemnts, and if it does is there a potential for a corection Indra Sistemas, massive Spanish defense player (heavily owned by Spanish government), looking to manufacture tanks soon, breaking ground in technology yet lagging behind for now

 & 

Sogeclair: perfectly situated small-cap French defense player, world-class financials, yet valued at a mere 80-90M EUR. Life-changing potential here. Hensoldt jumped like 15% up in past week, given the recently proven efficacy of drones might be worth considering. Although I would love to hear from people with more knowledge on the matter. All defense stocks might take a leap upward after NATOs meeting later in June. If all member countries agree to pay 5% of GDP instead of 2% to meet the US demand.

1l44kge,2025-06-05,"UNH baseline case
I get why people hate this stock because of ""ethics"" but you see, America in itself is already immoral. Where are these same freedom fighters against ""wall street"" or the ""rich mega corps"" that do the same things. America isnt going to change its healthcare system just because of Luigi. They make too much money to care about the poor. Look at Trump reducing their taxes while most people already don't have healthcare. People will vote against universal healthcare. You can say any other case or rationale, but the case on its ethics is just dumb.
If you’re bullish on the stock then just hold or keep buying the dip. These posts are useless and emotional. Disclaimer I have determination and I know how to navigate the American healthcare system.

I am disabled, retired on Medicare. I currently have a UnitedHealth special needs plan for critical conditions. I had one year where I switch to aetna by next year‘s open enrollment. I was begging for my UnitedHealth plan back.


As a customer, I do think it’s oversold it’s so embedded into the government it’s going to be hard to topple. They’re probably in that too big to fail criteria. Even the senators are buying stock in it. It put a spotlight on a particular company that is doing shady shit and opened a DOJ probe and other investigations, which means said shady shit might bite them.

It's not because people suddenly realized it was an unethical company, but because there are potentially real consequences for them specifically and opportunity for more information to come to light.

Whether you think anything will come of that is a separate question. UNH is 7th largest free cash flow company in US. I don't see them going bust. I'm just quietly buying, Reddit won't be what moves this stock. It is the reason the stock is down right now.  If you disagree with that reason then buy some and hold.  Throwing half-baked ideas around in a political drum isn't really useful discussion.

Also you didn't provide any kind of baseline case (your title) and this is an incredibly low effort post that will be removed. I'm surprised people act like only UNH does 'shady' things. All insurance companies do the same thing. The special master recommended dismissal of the case. Insurance and medical finance is an inherently unsexy and gross industry. But it’s not going anywhere.

People claiming we are going to see government healthcare need to remove the size 64s on their feet and yellow wigs. The country is in a desperately deep financial hole without that spending. The other Western countries with those systems afford it because Team USA went into debt up to its eyeballs giving them free military, markets, and technology for years—freeing up a ton of their annual tax proceeds for medical. If anything, bet on private insurance and hospitals GROWING in Germany and France if they seriously expand their military and tech prowess.

Even in China, virtually everyone I know of keeps private insurance because the regular free care is a Kafkaesque ring around the rosie. They will bail it out worse case scenario.

1l40phz,2025-06-05,"How can the SEC yield be so much lower than the distribution yield, and what does that mean for future dividends?
So I’m looking at a few ultra high dividend ETFs such as QQQI and SPYI and they have distribution yields of 13-15% with SEC yields below .5. Yet they are both considered very good ETFs by a lot of ratings agencies. How is this possible? Can someone explain?
SEC yield is a 30 day yield. Distribution is trailing 12 months. 

A simple google search and you would have known. You put more effort into writing this post than looking the definition of SEC yield. SEC yield does not include option income, which makes up almost all of the distributions from QQQI and SPYI. SEC yield is like your real paycheck.

1l405js,2025-06-05,"CRWV: AI Rocket or Debt Bomb? Thoughts?
Alright, looked into **CoreWeave (CRWV)**. It's an ""AI Hyperscaler"".. gives GPU (Nvidia) for AI stuff. Stock went nuts since IPO (like 300% up)  

**Quick Take:** CRWV: Big AI growth, Nvidia likes them. BUT huge debt, only 2 big clients (MSFT, OpenAI), and weird deals with Nvidia & Applied Digital where they invest in each other.

**The Good:**

* **AI Demand:** Selling GPU power for AI. Revenue shot up: $229M (2023) to maybe $8B (2025 est).Q1 2025 rev $981.6M, +420% YoY. 
* **Nvidia Favored?** Gets Nvidia's new GPUs (GB200s) early. Nvidia invested, owns \~7%. 
* **Huge Contracts:** $10B Microsoft deal (MSFT is 72% of Q1 rev!).\~$16B from OpenAI. 
* **Stock Surge:** Stock jumped big after IPO from AI hype & news. 

**The Bad:**

* **Massive Debt:** Over $12.7B raised (equity/debt) by end 2024, liabilities >$18.8B Q1 2025. Interest could be $2B+/year.S-1 said ""material weaknesses in internal control"". Not great.  
* **No Profit:** Big revenue, still big losses. Net loss $863M (2024), $314.6M (Q1 2025). 
* **Few Customers:** MSFT is 72% of revenue. OpenAI other main one. Risky.  
* **Nvidia Reliance:** All GPUs from Nvidia. If Nvidia has issues, CRWV does too.  

**The Weird Loops:**

* **Nvidia:**
   * Nvidia investor (\~7% stake). 
   * CRWV buys all GPUs from Nvidia. So NVDA invests, CRWV buys NVDA chips.  
   * NVDA *did* pay CRWV for services ($320M deal 2023).Now NVDA says not a customer, and Q1 rev from them <10%. So NVDA invests -> CRWV buys NVDA GPUs -> NVDA *used to* pay CRWV. Circular.  
* **Applied Digital (APLD):**
   * CRWV has \~$7B, 15yr lease deal with APLD for data centers. 
   * CRWV also has warrants for \~5.5% of APLD. So CRWV is big APLD customer AND investor.  

**So?**

Is CRWV a smart play with AI giants, or a debt bomb waiting to go off if partners, debt, or AI hype fails? They're racing to make cash from contracts to pay debt & upgrade GPUs before tech gets old. 

What u think? Big win or big fail?

*(NFA, my summary, do ur own DD.)*
I was a fan at $40, but not at $150. That said, this is another one of those where the Inverse Reddit trade paid off big time. NVDA is involved in a lot of this weird loop scenarios which nearly seems like a half scam to keep their revenue numbers. Using gross profits to pump money back in as revenue Theres a desperate need for Data Center growth 

Coreweave is ramping up on Data Center building with exclusive dibs on the newest NVIDIA GPU’s hitting the market which puts them ahead of any other competitor at the moment.

I got in at $70 and looking for new hyperscale AI companies with NVIDIA partnerships to jump on The bad: 

They used to be crypto mining company then spun off to this new company with AI tag cuz that hypes better.

CEO and founders are all investment managers. I hold CRWV since I bought $37.50 (avg) small qty, holding still as LT investment. Well maybe everyone else is wrong and you're right. When does the lockup period expire? It's actually really simple. NVIDIA can only sell as many GPUs as other companies can install. If you got a few  lackadaisical large companies moving slowly then you can't sell as much as you could produce. So you help bootstrap a few small businesses which can install GPUs. They eventually get their own revenue stream, because there is high demand, and now NVIDIA can sell more GPUs. Good question - isn't always the same? 6 mo?

1l3z97o,2025-06-05,"Is NVIDIA Getting Too Hot? My Short-Term Concerns with NVDA ($141.92)
I wrote my thesis on Palantir 30 mins before posting this one and looks like folks are not liking it. Long term NVDA could go up. This is purely a short term play. 

This is going to be a similar take to that one. 

NVIDIA’s been on an insane run lately. It was up over 20% since mid May and pushing back to all time highs around $142. The AI hype is obviously still alive and well. I genuinely believe AI is the future but still we need to be a bit more realistic.

Here’s what’s making me cautious:

* Options activity is nuts right now — the $140–$150 calls are getting snapped up like crazy
* Lots of short-dated call buying, mostly retail
* The whole “it can’t go down” vibe is creeping back in
* The stock’s up 10–12% straight with barely any pause

To be clear, I’m not saying NVDA is a bad company. It’s a beast, and the AI story is real. But even the strongest stocks usually pull back a bit after a move like this.

I’m looking at a possible short if it pushes into the $143–$145 range. Nothing aggressive, just a trade idea. Thinking we could see a pullback to $135ish (which lines up with the last breakout zone).

If it breaks above $147 though, I’m out. Could easily rip to $150+ from there.

Not trying to fade the long-term trend here. I am just synthesizing unusual market activity, insider moves, options flow, sentiment, technical and news analysis.

Market does bad - Orange man bad, manipulation

Market does good - Orange man bad, manipulation

Just invest your money for decades and there's nothing to worry about Wow, such a huge difference In tech, if you are not first, you are last. They are very far behind NVDA. NVDA holds 90% of the market share in AI training chips with its CUDA software platform. AMD is not industry standard and assuming all future projects keep using NVDA due to their technology advantage, AMD will slowly lose its 3% AI and data center market share overtime. Now I do believe there is some huge upside to AMD as well but it will not overshadow NVDA because NVDA is sector leader. If semi conductor stocks see surge, you best believe NVDA is also up. But if NVDA is down, it will pull the rest of the sector down with it, including AMD. As they say, let your winners run, so I would argue that I could see NVDA with 4t easily vs the market share AMD would need to take away from its competitors to get to 300b market cap. Its easier for Nvda to eat that market share because its only getting its root deeper and deeper in the AI infrastructure while the rest are still looking to grow.

I am long on semi conductors in general, I believe long term it will be one of the best sectors for investment (and possibly humanity). So while I do support and believe in AMD, I believe in the whole sector, but NVDA will be the cream of the crop for now. This is one time where a semi ETF I think is the best approach, they hold all important companies, non fluff, irreplaceable tech such as ASML (lithography), Applied materials, qualcomm, Texas Instruments and more.

Long $SOXX $SMH Yes. No. Maybe? People have been asking the same question 700% ago. lol cool we’re up 63% off April lows. Anybody can say it’s getting too hot. Just a technical trader in the wild, thats all. AI hype or not the pipeline for demand of NVDA hardware  is very strong, and while it is getting overpriced as a stock  its long term outlook still shows exceptional demand and looking at the whole ecosystem not just NVDA but the overall supply chain is being increased .  All these new FABs need to be producing something … Oracles nuclear powered data centers need hardware, new LLMs and as well as other kinds of AI models are being advanced … while we talk about Large Language Models Ai as a science is much much much larger than this subset.  All of the research and technology needs the hardware to power it and we are only at the beginning.  The bottom line , no we don’t have an Asimovian Positronic Brain from US Robotics but we will one day. we are only at the cusp of a technological revolution akin to the printing press, the Industrial Revolution, the integrated circuit, the internet … and NVDA at the moment is one of the foundational key stones to that revolution.  Can they be challenged yes but with dominance of CUDA and their GPUs owning 92% market share everyone in the hardware industry is playing catchup to their near ubiquitous and monopolistic ecosystem.  

But stocks aren’t based on reality … so who knows.  I read that some firms were expecting it to get all the way up to 170 at some point, but that might be in a perfect world. I really don't see the point in investing in NVDA when AMD can fly so much farther based on current price and valuation.  The odds of AMD hitting 300b before NVDA hitting 4T seems more probable. Well price targets are usually a 1 year time frame, so $170 is not too farfetched considering how it's been trading sideways for like a year now despite continued good performance.

Then there are those lunatic fuckers that give a price target of like $1000 for whatever reason. They should get fired. I can replace them.

1l3yldf,2025-06-05,"Tesla stock falls again as Musk's 'KILL the BILL' screed hits Trump tax bill's progress
No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-falls-again-as-musks-kill-the-bill-screed-hits-trump-tax-bills-progress-121409722.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-falls-again-as-musks-kill-the-bill-screed-hits-trump-tax-bills-progress-121409722.html)

Tesla (TSLA) stock slumped again on Thursday as the fallout continued to emerge from the very public policy blowout between President Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

""Call your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL,"" Musk posted on X on Wednesday.

Musk added, ""If the massive deficit spending continues, there will only be money for interest payments and nothing else!""

The vocal criticism is irking Trump, the Wall Street Journal reported, with a senior official claiming that White House advisors were ""caught off guard"" by Musk's latest broadsides.

Tesla stock fell solidly on Wednesday and extended those losses in premarket trading on Thursday, down as much as 3%.

The comments come after the one-time leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) waded earnestly into the debate over the bill this week, angrily posting Tuesday that it was a ""disgusting abomination.""

""I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,"" he said.

""Shame on those"" who voted for it in the House, Musk added.

Bloomberg reported that Musk may also be driven by the fact that the federal EV tax credit is being phased out by the bill, as he fought hard to keep it in place as a key driver for Tesla's business.

Musk's barrage comes as the bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate, and a Congressional Budget Office estimation of its impact on the deficit adds fuel to Musk's line of argument.

The nonpartisan office projected the House-passed version of the bill would add $2.4 trillion to deficits over the next 10 years.

The formerly Musk-led DOGE itself has been criticized for not producing the budgetary cuts Musk touted it could find, and the cuts it has produced have been deeply unpopular.

Musk's closeness to the Trump administration had been seen as a boon for Tesla, given its business with SpaceX and NASA and the regulatory levers the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could pull in getting autonomous driving rules in place for Tesla's robotaxi testing.

But demand weakness in the EU and recent protests at US Tesla showrooms have followed Musk's controversial foray into politics, causing some Tesla owners to become alienated by Musk, specifically by his right-leaning tendencies, DOGE, and outward support of President Trump.

Tesla's big robotaxi test is slated for June 12 in Austin. Much of the company's value is tied to whether it can fully unlock autonomous driving for robotaxi purposes and individual owners.

Meanwhile, Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Waymo continues to plow ahead and is essentially the leader in the space, accumulating 250,000 robotaxi trips per week.
Market in shock as Tesla drops on bad news. Elon is getting Scaramuccied - Trump demands absolute loyalty but offers none, any deal with him is worthless and he will cast you aside on a whim He pissed off the left then the right lol ""Bloomberg reported that Musk may also be driven by the fact that the federal EV tax credit is being phased out by the bill, as he fought hard to keep it in place as a key driver for Tesla's business.""

So that's it. Elon paid for Trump to win the election so he could destroy his competitors and give him all the money. Then Trump backed out on the deal. Who could have guessed. Musk exposed himself as nazi, destroyed his own reputation, cancelled a whole set of programs that were helping real people, and in reward he got kicked from the White House and slapped with a bill that is going to continue destroying his business. Now he has no customers, no government support. Good job pal, you def played this game right The stock value itself is like 50% meme anyway. It’s surprising how many people are still falling for this when we saw it happen every day during his first term. Higher than that. They had a 2025 Q1 profit of $409 million. For a company valued at $1 trillion, that is very very low. Like if you or i made only $1 in 3 months. By comparison, Apple is worth $3 trillion and had Q1 profits of $33 billion. Tesla had net profit of only $1.9 billion in q1 of 2024, so it's always been vastly overvalued.

1l3y0zr,2025-06-05,"The iShares Defense Industrials Active ETF (IDEF) is the most diversified defense sector ETF available to date.
One of the themes of 2025 has been Defense ETFs with the geopolitical tensions in the world today which saw the rise of Europe Defense ETFs earlier this year that diversified away from US defense ETFs. With BlackRock/iShares latest offering (IDEF), I document my reasons why I think IDEF should be a *must-have* for investors who want an ***actively managed and diversified investment in the Global defense sector.***

# Context:

* Prior to the launch of IDEF, there were only a several defense ETFs available for US investors which were also aerospace heavy (e.g. Boeing).
* The prominent ETFs which have had good performance are SHLD (Global X Defense Tech ETF) and for non-US investors, there was also DFNS (VanEck Defense UCITS ETF USD A).
* Recently, there have been EU-centric ETFs that came to prominence with the increased EU spending, such as EUAD (Select STOXX Europe Aerospace & Defense ETF), NATO (HANEtf The Global Defence ETF) and several others.

# The cons of the above:

1. Many of these ETFs have large concentration in aerospace companies rather than defense companies (e.g. Boeing),
2. Many of these also bloat with cybersecurity companies rather than defense companies (e.g. Crowdstrike, Palo Alto, Cisco),
3. High concentration and limited holdings. Particularly with the EU defense, you see high concentration in one to three companies (e.g. Rheinmetall, Thales, BAE, etc) which each hold an average of 10-15% weight in the portfolio, while ETFs such as DFNS are concentrated in 20-30 holdings,
4. With the prominence of Palantir, it also holds a high concentration in these ETFs of around 7-10%.

# What makes IDEF better and more well diversified:

1. It has approximately 120+ holdings, higher than any other Defense ETF,
2. The fund is actively managed, unlike majority of others which just track an index of companies thrown together to fit a theme,
3. Portfolio has exposure to South Korea, France, UK, Japan, Germany, Israel, Italy, Sweden, Canada, Australia, Singapore. The highest weight is just under 6% of all holdings (GE AEROSPACE, 5.58% as of 3 June)
4. The portfolio has the usual defense favorites such as Palantir, Thales, Rheinmetall, Rolls-Royce, Airbus and many more,
5. The portfolio also includes gems and companies that serve national defense infrastructure like Singapore Technologies Engineering Ltd (Singapore - 70% YTD), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd (Japan - 48% YTD), DroneShield Ltd (Australia - 117% YTD),
6. The portfolio also includes small exposures to potential high growth companies like Rocket Lab Inc, Archer Aviation, C3.ai, Redwire, Bigbear.ai,
7. Expense ratio is 0.55% which is in-line with other Defense ETFs but considered low when you consider this is actively managed compared to those that passively track an index or basket of companies.

# Downsides to the ETF:

* While this is currently the ETF which is the most diversified and has a large number of holdings, it is still US heavy at 59%.
* Being iShares/BlackRock, feels like there will always be the usual suspects such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin included.
* Current volume is low as the fund was only incepted on 19 May 2025, less than a month ago.

# How to address the downsides:

* To balance out the US heavy concentration, consider supplementing together with an EU defense ETF if you want more exposure to EU and less to US. There is no Asia/Oceanic ETF at the moment.
* To balance out the Boeing/Lockheed holdings, consider supplementing together with SHLD which does not hold these, and is arguably the 2nd best defense ETF available on the market.

Elon bringing Epstein into this is amazing I get that Tesla is a meme stock, but it blows my mind that Elon having an *online* spat with Trump is enough to tank the stock, and not the numerous garbage earnings reports, worldwide drops in sales, or endless recalls due to poorly built cars. So Elon's rage is due to the EV tax credit getting axed in the ""big, beautiful bill.""  

Good to know his rage is merely self-interest.  I was getting worried for a minute a billionaire might be genuine. Elon just tweeted that Trump is in the Epstein Files and that’s why they haven’t been released.

CNBC just reported.

It appears this back-and-forth between the two continues. Ironically they’re each commenting on their own separate social networks. A Trump/Musk feud tanking the entire market makes no f'ing sense Is this petty ass shit on Twitter/Truth really the thing that's making the market do a dive now?

Jesus Christ. Again, a fucking clown market. Watch Trump allow BYD to sell cars in the US now just to be petty. I gotta hand it to Trump, sure his trade wars are disastrous for the economy, but theyre the pump that doesn't stop pumping.

Everytime we get some bad economic data, or a round of negative headlines about the administration, he can talk up the ""great discussions"" and ""advancements towards a deal"" made with any one of dozens of countries and get the market to jump.

1l3rrch,2025-06-05,"Stablecoin issuer Circle prices IPO at $31 per share, above expected range
Circle Internet Group, the issuer of one of the world’s biggest stablecoins, priced its initial public offering at $31 per share late Wednesday. That’s above the expected range of $27 to $28 and gives the company a total market value of $6.8 billion.

New York-based Circle, its founder and some original shareholders will raise $1.05 billion in the offering of 34 million shares. In a measure of enormous demand for the crypto company, Circle increased the number of shares sold in the IPO from 32 million after the market closed Wednesday. Originally, Circle had sought to raise just $624 million by selling 24 million shares in a range of $24 to $26 per share.

Circle granted its underwriters, led by JPMorgan, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, a 30-day option to sell an additional 5.1 million shares. Circle stock will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol “CRCL.”

Circle, led by CEO Jeremy Allaire, is one of the earliest companies in the crypto industry and the issuer of USD Coin, commonly referred to by its ticker, USDC. It’s the second largest stablecoin in the world, comprising 27% of the market, behind Tether’s USDT, which dominates 67% of the stablecoin market.

1l3glu5,2025-06-04,"Investing $5000 as a 17 Year Old
I am a 17 Year Old With $9000 and want to know if this plan is okay. For context, I used to be a server which is how I made my money, but now I do not work and only earn a bit of money though babysitting/selling my old clothes/etc. This money has just been sitting in my checking and savings account for the last 3 years, earning less than a dollar of interest per year ...

I did a lot of research and made a plan for what to do with this money. Keep in mind I am going to college in the fall, but I don't have to do any loans/payment because I got a lot of scholarships and parents got the rest. So I just wanted to ask how my plan is and if anyone has any advice:

Checking account: $750 (I'm pretty frugal/don't spend much money, though I know I will have to spend more in college)

High Yield Savings Account: $3000

Stocks (About $4500) These are the ones I currently have picked out and how much I would put in. Should I get rid of any and just put it all in SPLG or SCHD or is this ok?

SPLG (50%) SCHD (35%) VUG (10%) NVDA (5%)

then i was thinking about putting $500 in a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund. But should I just wait until I get a part time job (probably a few months) to make a Roth IRA? Because you need income to contribute to one right?

To summarize I just want to know if those stocks I picked are good or if I should get rid of some or choose others, and if I should make a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund or wait until I have a job to make a Roth IRA.
You should make a Roth IRA now - no need for a job to make one. (edit: as long as the income is earned - like you mentioned you were a server) 

Put a portion of these funds into it (won't be accessible without a penalty, so make the choice yourself of how much you can lock away). Just buy an etf like you listed here and let it sit.

high yield savings - if it's for refilling your checking account, fine. otherwise get rid of it and add to ETF in a non-retirement account so you can still access if necessary

your etfs are generally good. I would recommend staying away from dividend etfs if you're this young - better to grow capital and then allocate to dividends for income when you're older I hope this comes off gracefully, but I really can’t seem to understand the mentality of young/new investors stock picking NVDA. I get that it’s only 5% of the total money you want to allocate, but take into consideration that NVDA is currently the most valuable publicly traded company sitting at a market cap of $3 Trillion. How much more upside do you think there is? In order for NVDA to double in price up to $280, that’s a $6 Trillion market cap. 

There is a possibility this can happen over the next 5-10 years given that we are in a massive AI boom, but there’s also potential for the bubble to burst. Stock picking is a skill that’s really exclusive to seasoned investors that are able to understand the implications on balance sheets, PE ratios, and macro economics at play that can influence valuation in both good and bad ways. I’m not saying NVDA is a bad stock to pick, but it’s likely not the one that will outperform the overall market over the next 5 years, given its current valuation. I could be wrong about that too because nobody can predict the future, but just think about that.

At 17, I really wouldn’t be investing in anything other than index funds. VOO, SPLG, SCHD, and VUG are all solid. 

In the future when you’re able to grow this money to something you’re proud of, at that point you could consider allocating a modest amount to stock picking once you’ve got the education and experience to spot really good opportunities. Best of luck man! I learned to gamble when I was 17 They literally said the same thing when Nvidis was at 500B market cap. Then it went to a trillion. Then 2, then 3. Now it’s gonna hit 4 with the way it’s going. I would just condense all those index fund into one like splg, voo, or voog and then 5% of NVDA ( not needed but also not bad to have as a single stock ). and make sure the HYSA fund is accessible when you need it in college. otherwise, good stuff for your age Focus on growth while you’re young. Do something like FXAIX over SCHD Put it into car detailing equipment and keep that hustle through college it makes bank No actively managed fund has managed to beat a passive index fund over a 10-year period. And a monkey throwing darts at a board with stock names gets as good a return as most stock pickers. So look for the index fund with the cheapest fee and forget about trying to pick individual stocks at the moment. 

If you want to prepare to move out of index funds and into investing and/or trading later,  get a paper trading account and practice trading without risking your real money. Hook your checking account up to an account at treasurydirect.gov.  Set up weekly purchases of 4-week t-bills, each $2000, every week, as far as you can schedule them.

This place is turning more and more into wsb every day Wait. I just remembered. Wasn't today the ""deadline for deals"" submitted to Trump? The resistance makes a bit more sense. Dumbasses hopped up on hopium that Trump will give himself an out. Yeah, so, like I told someone yesterday; an increase in job openings doesn't mean that people are actually getting jobs. ""Ghost jobs"" have been a thing for years now.  
  
Man, these ADP numbers are fucking pathetic.

This is just the start of the bad data! Y'all strap in. Hope you enjoyed your gains in May. I trust Powell a lot more than the 7 time bankruptee social media poster but the ADP numbers are actually shit. More bad news, so I'm sure markets will be up again today just like everyday.

Surely this party will never end! Don't see the point of buying here unless your long term buying. Why chase what little gain is left in a volatile market when there's still lots of valid uncertainty and shady shit going on Difference between then and now is that there's not trillions in free money being shoved into everyone's pockets.

1l2tkqk,2025-06-04,"Congratulate me like I'm 5!
My profolio gained 33% since March. It was a happy accident. I'm going through a divorce, my ex husband is being petty (I found out about things and I am justified in leaving) 

My biggest contributor's were nvda, Microsoft, and amd and core wave pushed me over 29% ( I was late in buying but I still got a nice profit). I feel pretty good especially since my parents keep on telling me to not trust stocks, that I'll lose everything (I'm almost 40 and they keep on implying that I'm going to start drinking and doing drugs because of my divorce) I wanted to share because my parents would be upset, my ex would be furious (even though he makes 4x as much as me), my kids don't understand, my co workers aren't into it and my friends aren't around for me to tell them in person. Thanks for reading!
Good job kid! Here's a lollipop! Yay! Nice job! 👏

Seriously, that’s impressive. Some people don’t make 30% in three _years_ let alone three months.

Take me for example. I lost 30% in one week. That is not a yay. Yes! I grew up in a culture that basically says divorced women are as valueless as used shoes. very harsh culture and basically a taboo that no one wants to talk about. 

and then found out divorce literrally didn’t do much damage , especially for women who have enough self esteem and good earning capabilities. 

Self earned Money is a woman’s best courage. 

and don’t forget, 54% of total wealth in USA is held by women. 

anyways,

1l2qwch,2025-06-03,"Thinking about picking up some Google, Apple, Broadcom and NVIDIA stock. Thoughts?
I think all of these companies are heavily undervalued and everyone is scared of tariffs. Google at least won’t be entirely impacted by tariffs and they’re the leader in AI right now. Apple is being thrown around with tariffs but they’re extremely profitable. Nvidia is also undervalued because they’re pretty much the only way to train AI which is the next frontier. Broadcom also has insane revenue growth and momentum. What do yall think? 
My thoughts are these companies are too big to significantly outperform. You are better off and safer just buying the sp500. I will get downvoted, but that’s my view. People said that when Apple was at 500B valuation,  then 1T valuation,  then 2T valuation... 

I swear just over a year ago, people were screaming NVDA is SUPER overvalued at 500 (before the recent split), and now they want to buy at 90s. So instead, many investors spent all their money on INTC and AMD, thinking these companies will have larger potential to 3X their investment compare to NVDA.

Big winners will keep winning. The bigger they are, the more momentum they have, and they will not slow down for a long time... GOOGLE has struggled. People love it or hate it now. Ive significantly accumulated. It will perform eventually. I say go for it. Is your investment advice better than your English at least? Bear in mind if they are forced to sell chrome you may see the stock price go down considerably in the short term. On the other hand their AI products seem to not only have caught up but surpassed competition in some areas. Not financial advise. Yes, I’m invested in all the companies you’ve mentioned and have been since 2019-2020. I’ve continued to invest in them at times when the market has tanked to further reduce my average share purchase price. My total return for each stock is positive and for Apple is 100% in the last 5 years and for nVidia is 900% over the past 5 years. The only wrong move you can make is not investing sooner (or buying in when market sentiment is overly bullish). Lol, it's dominating your engineering firm but it's often wrong?


Puts on the bridges you're building.  I own all of these.

I would say you can pick up some Google and Apple now because market sentiment isn't the greatest so you get a discount.

Wait for AVGO and NVDA to drop before going in, they tend to swing like crazy and you can get a better price than now imo. Just wait for a tweet or two. Honestly, I thought the exact same thing since 2021, but looking at their performance I think you can see how long the market can stay irrational for.

I got into TSLA before the market, and it came off smoothly at $351, and by the way, I also liquidated my position in CRWV. although CRWV averaged $100 and sold at $148, making a small profit, I missed out on the back of the market that spiked up to $155.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

1l259sh,2025-06-03,"VOO etf vs ""safe"" + growth big cap stocks?
Hi guys, so I know this question was asked before. But I hope to hear your opinions on this. I know buying VOO etf and contribute every month is the key. However, I can't ignore the fact that there are some relatively safe mega cap companies with growth potential like NVDA, Amazon, Google. etc. As of now, my portfolio includes NVDA, amazon, google, Apple & baba.

I did a quick calculation on compounding interest for VOO. In 5 years, with an average of 9% return (I am being conservative here), a $50k initial investment with no monthly contribution in VOO could be $76,931. So basically around 50% return after 5 years. If I put $1000 monthly contribution, the amount would be $148,747 after 5 years. This is almost triple.

Now mega caps like amazon, google, NVDA, a 50% increase in their market cap in 5 years is possible. But these companies are 2-3 trillions now. They will certain get bigger but 50% bigger is a lot and pretty sure they won't get triple in 5 years. Looking back 5 most recent years, SP500 has been up 94.58% while Amazon lags behind only 68.57%. Google did better at 139.82%. Apple is 153.9%. Microsoft is 152%. NVDA is a different monster at 1455%.

So now I start to regret my buying strategy. I should just buy VOO and make monthly contribution, and only keep smaller positions for these stock picks. Am I missing something here? is VOO's compound interest that powerful? is there any downside for investing in SP500 ?
No, that is what you should do, you're not missing anything. Individual companies carry individual risk and you already get a pretty heavy weighting to a lot of the fast growers in the s&p 500

History is littered of examples of stocks that looked great and then went on to have massive declines. it's very hard to predict these things. You can take smaller bets on individual companies if you like and your performance with them will lead to underperformance or out performance but keep in mind when you buy one of these companies you also need to figure out where you're going to sell it. Buying is only half the trade. With the s&p 500 it's virtually the entire trade because you just keep costs averaging until you need the money or you retire or whatever your goal is. I keep a newspaper in my office from the 1970s, it's the stock section, hundreds of companies, I only recognize the name of a few. I'm talking a handful. This is the nature of things You had a good plan, you ran the numbers, you figured out your risk parameters, it's an easy plan to stick to. It works, what are you actually gaining by just adding more products? 

There are lots of arguments that can be made for different indexes. The s&p 600 for example is trading at this historic low PE relative to the s&p 500. If you look at that over the past couple decades the s&p 600 is an amazing value... But what if it stays an amazing value for the next 5 years?  a lot of people are conditioned to just habitually buy the s&p 500. You have the best companies in it. It's an easy strategy to stick to that you don't really second guess. If you get into trouble or we go through a recession you just start adding more. It's one of the few things that you can just use as a money dump without having to actively manage your risk. I mean if the s&p 500 goes down in flames, the only thing that's going to matter is clean water, guns and a good food source so the loss of capital will be the least of our problems Why makes something simple more complicated? I mean, it certainly can. That'd be the point of owning them The problem is you’re using past to justify future decisions, not genuine good reasoning and analysis. If that was a good strategy why doesn’t everyone just do it? Because it’s not. Most of those companies currently face government antitrust lawsuits and face many risks being broken up or hurt. Nvidia while dominant can lose market share now rather than likely gain significantly more. Amongst other issues. They’re quality good companies but still bear a good amount of risk. Especially if we go into stagflation/an economic downturn, tech tends to be hit HARD. 

“Growth” does not mean a company’s stock grows faster, though yes we have seen that in recent years. In short it’s basically historically their earnings are growing fast, but that doesn’t always translate to stock price growth. Instead try to evaluate a company’s history in various metrics about how they are good about consistently improving; is leadership good, can you properly explain why you think it will grow more than the market already expects, do you truly know what a company does deeply or just at high level, consider the economic conditions we are in/future, etc Take a look at googles performance this year vs VOO.  Thats why you index. Adding individual stocks does not increase expected return What are your thoughts on investing into VTI and VXUS? With the index hype, investors are obviously making a return on individual stocks otherwise nobody would invest in them. A lot of these big tech companies make up most of the indexes. So does it make more since just to go more in on these companies? With the index hype, investors are obviously making a return on individual stocks otherwise nobody would invest in them.

1l1pb6a,2025-06-02,"Alphabet stock could drop up to 25% if judge forces Google to sell Chrome, Barclays says
No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-stock-could-fall-as-much-as-25-in-black-swan-event-if-judge-orders-google-chrome-divestiture-174438942.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-stock-could-fall-as-much-as-25-in-black-swan-event-if-judge-orders-google-chrome-divestiture-174438942.html)

Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) stock could drop between 15% and 25% if US District Judge Amit Mehta orders Google to sell off its Chrome browser, Barclays analysts wrote in a note to investors Monday.

In August 2024, Google lost a landmark antitrust trial against the US Department of Justice. Judge Mehta found the tech giant guilty of monopolizing the search engine market — specifically, the markets for ""general search"" and ""general search text"" ads, which are ones that appear at the top of the search results page, Yahoo Finance’s Alexis Keenan reported.

Last Friday, Google and the Department of Justice wrapped up closing arguments in the remedies phase of the case. The Department of Justice argued that Mehta should force Google to divest its web browser, Chrome, and share its search data with rivals as well as ban its exclusivity agreements that secure Google as the default search engine on mobile devices and browsers, Keenan and Yahoo Finance’s Dan Howley reported.

Barclays analyst Ross Sandler wrote in a Monday note that “the probability of a Chrome divestiture, while low, has increased in our view,” following the closing arguments, adding that “the most likely candidates” to buy Chrome would be “well funded AI companies like OpenAI, Anthropic or perhaps Perplexity.”

Sandler said such an outcome would be “a major blow” to Google, given that Chrome has 4 billion users and represents 35% of Google’s search revenue.

“This would be a major development, a black swan event for GOOGL shares,” he said. “Shares would obviously trade off significantly if this were to play out as no investors we speak to are thinking this remedy plays out.”

Sandler said a Chrome divestiture would not only cause Alphabet stock to tumble as much as 25% but would also result in a potential 30% hit to Alphabet’s earnings per share.

“The reality is we don't know what the court is going to decide on remedies, we listened to the entire day of closing arguments and there were certainly times where we felt a lot worse than we did prior, and other times where we felt better (in terms of GOOGL stock price impact),” Sandler said. He holds an Overweight rating on the stock.

Mehta is expected to decide on a remedy in the case — and the fate of Google’s search empire — in August. Google said Saturday that it will appeal the case.

Separately on Monday, Alphabet said it agreed to spend $500 million to change its compliance structure in order to settle a case with shareholders accusing the company of antitrust violations.

Alphabet stock fell 1.5% on Monday, and shares are down 10.6% year to date.
I will go hard into it if they do and it does. Ill just put 25% of my networth into google if that happens. I thought we're only allowed to post how undervalued GOOGL is? Lmao what is this bs Google is up 10% since November 2021, even after having the largest net profit on Earth.

Google lost in the last 4 years aggregated 35% of their stock price due to the “Google will be split” news posted every month. And now we expect another 25%. Amazing! And it could also go up 25% if they don’t have to sell it Ditto.  

Waymo + Gemini, + more cash than MSFT or AMZN  + lower forward PE than the rest of the SP500

... and my experience, Gemini is simply better than ChatGPT or Grok, at least at math (where I use it).  Better at following instructions and not hallucinating.   And even better at Claude, which other people seem to claim is better at math/coding.  But in my experience Claude is excessively complicated and ChatGPT/Grok make stuff up too aggressively. Exactly, Chrome makes zero sense to sell off from a competition perspective. And if the stock falls, I'm buying. **META FORCES GOOGLE TO SELL CHROME**

is only a 1-character typo lol YouTube, Waymo, Android, Google Deepmind, GCP are each potential $500B+ companies, may be $1T.

So, I would love if they brake up (that won't happen, unfortunately).

And I will keep piling up these at these insane low valuations.

Now that Trump knows about the TACO trade, I think there is a decent chance he will double down on ill-conceived tariffs just to show that he's not a chicken. ""right now"" is the operative part of this sentence. The Supreme Court doesn't always give Trump what he wants, but he always gets the big stuff. I'm not confident they will follow the Constitution.

1l1jiiv,2025-06-02,"Best API for fundamental data
I used to use Financial Modeling Prep (FMP) but cancelled my subscription when they decided to rise the price of the data I was using and made many data points part of a higher cost subscription.

I am looking for a reliable alternative to FMP that has all of the same data as FMP. Ideally I would like to pay no more than $50 a month for the data.

I use the API in Google Sheets so it would need to be something that could integrate with Sheets.

The data I need is normalized fundamental data going back at least 10 years (earnings reports, etc.), historic price and volume data, insider trading data, news mentions, options data would be nice, ideally basic economic data, etc.

Does anyone have any suggestions that you have used and can personally vouch for?
Revelata isn't exactly what you want, but it's close and $25/month. Pulls KPIs and tables from filings and stitches them into time series. No API today, but an Excel Add-In option that can update things when new filings come out. Preview access to a few tickers [here](https://www.revelata.com/free?ticker=NVDA&formType=10-K).   
  
Free trial is full functionality, so maybe worth checking out how easy it is to adjust your workflow if the price is right. You can use Yahoo Gold $39 a month. You can pair it with yahoo query api and you're golden. Up to 40yrs of earnings data. I actually like finchat.io Not gonna happen for less than $50 a month with your requirements I think

Eodhisotricaldata is another but they have issues with poorly thought out responses and non versioned APIs and they aren't as cheap as they used to be https://discountingcashflows.com/subscriptions/

I used the website a lot. You can test the API for free. Search a ticker, go to financials, select dev mode, and see the JSON. Then if you need a bunch of requests you can pay. Another alternative with high fidelity is

**Add** [**DCSC.ai**](http://DCSC.ai) for sector insights: relevance scores, dynamic classification, and transaction analytics.  
Optionally pull in **free economic data** (e.g., FRED, etc.) and **options data** from other sources to supplement.

Together, both platforms should wrap key FMP capabilities into one neat API-driven workflow—well suited for Google Sheets integration. Regarding pricing, it is pretty reasonable. You can contact them and give my reference.

I feel this could be one of those oversold bounce setups. If it breaks above $312 with volume, maybe we see a move toward $330-350. But obviously if $294 fails, this probably heads to the $250s pretty quick.

Anyone else been tracking this or staying away because of the investigation? The technical setup looks decent but the fundamental risks are obviously real.

What's your take? $302 feels like a decent entry but I think its better to wait for $312 with volume to enter.
...or it just goes sideways for the rest of the year. “Brand value”? The value in UHC is its market share and in the data its subsidiary Optum owns and sells. There is no brand. I hope for a retest of $250 so I can load up more shares.
If we go towards $350 now, I'm also okay with that.

Either way, I see it as a win-win for any long-term investor. I think by brand value he meant reputation. People don't seem to realize that UNH had absolutely rock solid bullet proof financial performance for decades, like almost unheard of consistency. UNH is non-discretionary, non-cyclical, tariff-proof, recession-resistant, has immense pricing power, but most importantly...they had not missed a single earnings forecast in 17 years, with consistent YoY growth. This was long considered one of the best and safest value stocks in the SP500. Part of the reason why the market panicked and overreacted when they actually missed an earnings forecast is because... it hasn't happened in literally decades. It bounced from 250 to 320 hard. Then settled around the 290 to 300 range. They wish they had no brand value. They have negative brand value atm Airlines are crap stock. Different from healthcare sector. $250 should be a no brainer.. to enter. long term should regain the highs. BA has consistently fucked up by letting go expert engineers and making broken planes.

**Jobs Report Comes As Fed Faces Pressure on Interest Rates**  
The scheduled Friday release of the May U.S. jobs report will show whether the labor market continues to exhibit strength after employers added more jobs than analysts expected in April, as the unemployment rate remained at 4.2%.

Trump has been applying pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates from their current levels of 4.25% to 4.5%. Fed officials have said that they are in “wait-and-see” mode as the labor market remains strong and inflation comes under pressure from U.S. tariffs.

Earlier in the week, market watchers will get updates on job openings, private-sector payrolls, and weekly jobless claims.

Several Fed officials are scheduled to speak, including Federal Reserve Chair Powell, Dallas Fed President Logan, Chicago Fed President Goolsbee, and Philadelphia Fed President Harker. On Wednesday, the Fed’s Beige Book will provide more details on economic conditions throughout the country.

The Thursday scheduled report on the U.S. trade deficit comes as tariff threats have pushed shippers to increase imports ahead of the expected import taxes.

Investors will also be watching manufacturing and services industry surveys scheduled for release this week, as well as updated data on consumer credit levels, factory orders, and construction spending.

**Tech, Retail Earnings Reports in Focus**  
Chipmaker Broadcom’s scheduled financial report, due Thursday, comes on the heels of industry leader Nvidia’s (NVDA) report last week that showed continued demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products. Broadcom reported a 77% jump in its AI-related revenue in its most recent financial release as company executives forecast continued growth in that sector.

Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike Holdings is expected to release its earnings on Tuesday. The firm said in early May that it planned to cut 5% of its workforce. Guidewire Software, which provides services to insurance providers, is also expected to deliver an update on its AI products Tuesday.

Logistics software provider Descartes Systems Group is expected to release its earnings on Wednesday. Shippers continue to grapple with the impact of Trump's tariffs on the supply chain.

With consumer sentiment surveys showing increasing concerns over economic conditions, investors will be watching reports from retailers for signals on spending. Scheduled reports from Dollar General on Tuesday and Dollar Tree and Five Below on Wednesday will provide a look at consumer traffic at those stores. Campbell’s scheduled report on Monday will shine a light on food spending, while fashion brands Lululemon and Calvin Klein parent PVH also will be reporting.

Other noteworthy reports this week include Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO, a competitor to Tesla in that country, and information technology provider Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

1l0dlct,2025-06-01,"Cracks in the Bond market - Curious to know all your thoughts on the comments by JPM CEO.
[‘It Is Going to Happen’: JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon Warns of Crack in the Bond Market](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/it-is-going-to-happen-jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-warns-of-crack-in-the-bond-market/ar-AA1FQ3u8?cmp_prftch=2&ocid=msedgntp&pc=U531&cvid=ecb321dc797d4275aa055838c1f2c766&ei=12)

What exactly will be the implication if something like this happens? Would that mean money flowing into stocks?
If people might be selling bonds in a “panic” as Dimon says, stocks will be in much worse shape. Ain't no margin calls like those from stemming from the bond market. Stocks pale in comparison. Entire nations can go bankrupt overnight. If US government backed bonds are yielding 6-8%, things are well and truly fucked. It’s a situation where you don’t want him to be right. The stock market would be the least of our worries if the bond market imploded. The Fed will step in and buy up treasuries before there is a collapse.  That's kind of already happening through what is being called stealth QE, but if it gets out of hand inflation will skyrocket - that's a future problem though and preferable to the panic a true treasuries market collapse would bring.  The way Dimon envisions things happening just doesn't fit in today's modern world.

The only real way the bond market collapses is if the Treasury department defaults on bond payments...  In the past that was simply an impossibility, but given how deep Soviet claws have dug into the GOP, and how politically unstable the United States is becoming through the actions of the red party, a default by the Federal Government is now a plausible occurrence.  If a default happens all bets are off.  I'll say this though:  If the Treasury defaults, Dimon is one of the people partly responsible for it happening.  Dimon's political behavior has directly lead to the crisis in America and the insanity that now reigns over the GOP is partly because of Dimon.  Mango, MGT, Bobert, these are all allies of Dimon, he's helped fund them and bring them to power and in non trivial ways.  If Dimon gets pulled out of his house and eaten in an economic apocalypse, then Dimon would simply be laying in the bed he helped make. They won’t sell, they will just stop buying and let the bills they own run through maturity. Most of it isn’t long term debt, so why sell it at a discount.

That reduction in buying has already begun and that’s why the yield is rising. If bond yields skyrocket, why would you want stocks yielding 2.5% when you can buy bonds yielding 6,7,8%?

Secondly, if the bond market implodes, corporations are going to struggle to borrow and their earnings will take a huge hit. Liz Truss barely left 10 Downing St. Bond yields in Japan are 1%. So it's a different kettle of fish 

The high yields are a problem because of the high debt to gdp, in the US were at 5% now, so now that far to go to 6%.",198,0.94,151,0,houcok,stocks,['JPM'],cracks bond market curious know thoughts comments jpm ceo going happen jpmorgan ceo jamie dimon warns crack bond market exactly implication something like happens would mean money flowing stocks people might selling bonds panic dimon says stocks much worse shape aint margin calls like stemming bond market stocks pale comparison entire nations go bankrupt overnight us government backed bonds yielding 68 things well truly fucked situation dont want right stock market would least worries bond market imploded fed step buy treasuries collapse thats kind already happening called stealth qe gets hand inflation skyrocket thats future problem though preferable panic true treasuries market collapse would bring way dimon envisions things happening doesnt fit todays modern world real way bond market collapses treasury department defaults bond payments past simply impossibility given deep soviet claws dug gop politically unstable united states becoming actions red party default federal government plausible occurrence default happens bets ill say though treasury defaults dimon one people partly responsible happening dimons political behavior directly lead crisis america insanity reigns gop partly dimon mango mgt bobert allies dimon hes helped fund bring power non trivial ways dimon gets pulled house eaten economic apocalypse dimon would simply laying bed helped make wont sell stop buying let bills run maturity isnt long term debt sell discount reduction buying already begun thats yield rising bond yields skyrocket would want stocks yielding 25 buy bonds yielding 678 secondly bond market implodes corporations going struggle borrow earnings take huge hit liz truss barely left 10 downing st bond yields japan 1 different kettle fish high yields problem high debt gdp us 5 far go 6

# As Intel exits the trough of the semiconductor cycle, does AMD still have hope? Twice as many assets as AMD is the biggest advantage.

**Undervalued giant vs. overhyped challenger**



In 2024, when INTEL released its third-quarter earnings report, its stock price collapsed. Countless AMD fans cheered, various remarks continued in X SPACE, and mainstream media began to relay such as

>\* INTEL is going to die, stupid guys actually have their own factories and workers.

>\* They should learn from AMD, don't need to have anything, light assets are right. AMD YES!

>\* In the German market, 99% of shipments are AMD and only 1% are INTEL. INTEL is dead.

>\* The coachman and driver in the steam engine era, no company should be eliminated more than INTEL, and INTEL actually has a factory, which is a shame for the United States.

>\* Look at what Apple does, they only do design, wake up, the United States does not need factories.

>\* AMD has been on a roll in recent years. Once seen as the underdog, it is now worth nearly twice as much as Intel—and Intel has twice as many assets, its own fabs, a global supply chain, and arguably the most strategic position in U.S. semiconductor security.

I have asked these people a question more than once: how to understand the semiconductor cycle? Do chip manufacturers really not need the entire industry chain? Taking a step back, INTEL is the real domestic chip security in the United States. And what it gets is always endless ridicule.

But is this shift entirely justified? Or is it a reflection of market sentiment, AI hype, and short-term memory?

I have worked as an IT technical consultant in the manufacturing industry, and I still have a good understanding of production. I know very well that owning a factory will be a heavy burden, which will lead to a longer cycle and profit encroachment, but the advantage is that once you pass the trough, your own production capacity will be a nuclear-powered money printing machine.

And based on China's experience, the security brought by own factories is far greater than outsourcing.

I deeply remember what the former CEO of INTEL said, ""We added AI chips and AI computing to the motherboard, but we don't know what it can do. This is what the application layer does."" INTEL's dilemma is actually the same as Apple's. They are honest people in the industry. They tell the truth, and capital does not need the truth.There are countless AI enthusiasts, non-IT personnel, and AI vested interests. They will infinitely exaggerate AI, even if it is like science fiction. But no one cares, because this is what capital needs.

 **The myth that “bigger is not better”**

Intel is one of the few companies in the world with full-stack semiconductor capabilities—from x86 architecture design to advanced process nodes, packaging, foundry services, and global distribution. Although costly, its fixed assets provide the United States and its allies with protection against geopolitical risks and long-term strategic autonomy.



In contrast, AMD adopts a fabless model—lean, capital-efficient, and agile. But it also means AMD is heavily dependent on TSMC, a potential single point of failure. In times of peace and profitability, this may seem like an advantage. But in times of turmoil, this may not be the case.



While the market currently rewards asset-light models with higher P/E ratios, one can't help but ask: What is the intrinsic value of resilience, control, and national independence in the post-globalization era?



 **Intel's decline is real - but so is its reconstruction**

Let's be honest: Intel has made mistakes. Delays in 10nm, missed opportunities in mobile, and a slow transition to AI have damaged its credibility. Investors have lost patience.



But Intel today is not the Intel of 2018. Under CEO Pat Gelsinger, the company:



Introduced Intel 3G and 18A nodes ahead of schedule



Opened its fabs (Intel foundries) to external customers



Getted strong support through the CHIPS Act



Entered AI accelerator market with Gaudi series chips



Worked on IDM 2.0 strategy to regain manufacturing leadership



These are not promises on paper - they are capital-intensive, multi-year initiatives. If executed well, these initiatives may turn Intel from a ""value trap"" to a ""growth surprise"".



 **AMD: A great company, but is the hype sustainable?**



To be clear, AMD is a phenomenal success story. Lisa Su's leadership is a textbook case. Ryzen and EPYC have disrupted Intel's dominance in the consumer and data center markets. MI300X has now positioned AMD as the second-largest player in AI acceleration - second only to NVIDIA.



However, AMD's stock price currently reflects its perfect execution in the extremely competitive AI market. Investors are betting that AMD will:



Sustain double-digit growth in the post-AI bubble era



Continue to take market share from Intel and NVIDIA



Deal with growing competition from internal accelerators (AWS, Google, Meta)



This won’t be easy.



**AI: A bursting bubble?**



A large part of AMD’s current valuation stems from the AI ​​hype cycle. But problems are emerging:



AI capex at hyperscalers is slowing



Tech giants are developing their own chips, reducing their reliance on AMD/NVIDIA



Many AI startups that received funding in 2021-2023 are now working to monetize their models



If AI enters the “normalization phase,” the outsized expectations associated with AMD may come under pressure. Meanwhile, Intel—whose stock price already reflects pessimism—has less to lose and more to gain.



**Strategic value: Intel is more than a company—it’s infrastructure**



Intel is more than a chipmaker. It’s the backbone of America’s technological sovereignty.



It’s the only US company with cutting-edge node ambitions



It provides CPUs for defense, aviation, infrastructure, and edge computing



Its survival is seen as a national interest



While this doesn’t guarantee profits, it guarantees protection. Intel’s valuation has a floor — and, when the cycle turns, its ceiling could be much higher than its current valuation.



**Valuation Snapshot: 2025 (as of May)**



Metrics: Intel AMD

Market Cap \~$130B \~$260B

Total Assets \~$190B \~$70B

Expected P/E \~33x \~45x

R&D Spending (TTM) \~$17B \~$6B

Revenue (TTM) \~$55B \~$23B



If the semiconductor cycle turns, as it has historically, and Intel’s foundry and AI businesses are able to succeed, this valuation gap may seem absurd in hindsight.



**Bottom line: $18 is too cheap, but $38 isn’t too expensive**

Intel’s 2022-2023 collapse was painful but also cleansing. Now it stands on the brink of a new chapter — AI, independent foundry, and a return to competitive execution.



Meanwhile, AMD, while still great, may have peaked in its narrative power.



So the question remains:



When the cycle turns, will Intel — the undervalued giant — make a strong comeback? And if so, where will AMD go when the music stops?
Suggestion: if using AI to write these, make it summarize it at least? Intel is undervalued for sure, but the opportunity cost of waiting for their recovery or buy out is the reason it’s so low. What's this ""hype"" over AMD you speak of? 

Seems like 90% of the comments I read about AMD are bearish AF This AI generated slop has a ton of errors. The market caps, the revenues, PE, etc for AMD are all incorrect. [deleted] It’s a false statement the companies are only now just starting to develop their own AI chips. All majors companies are on gen2/3 of their chips. The competition from other companies has been going on for 7+ years. > Market Cap ~$130B ~$260B

Uhh, this AI bot is using really old information. 

INTC Market Cap: $85B

AMD Market Cap: $179B

If you're getting these numbers wrong then the rest of your write up is probably also wrong.


Bad bot. AI spam is treason against humanity Well said. And people definitely do not place a high value on security until they lose it. When, not if, China moves on Taiwan, Intel will have a lot of value. Intel can also petition the US government for more exemptions from semiconductor tariffs than other companies. Lastly of course, there are many designers but few foundries, and fabs are the supply bottleneck. Therefore there is a lot to gain as a fab vs a designer now. Supply and Demand laws.

On the AMD front, AMD is well run but short of Nvidia ending up like Intel, I do not see an opening for AMD to get ahead at this point. Nvidia just has so much more money and power now. So alot of people are attracted to AMD because they expect it to beat Nvidia, well news flash, AMD only beat Intel in CPU after decades of Intel's decline. Impressive since they nearly went bankrupt, but Lisa Su is a great ceo. 

In other words, the AMD or Intel thesis already assumes the money has been made with Nvidia, so now you have to weigh the odds: will AMD beat Nvidia or will Intel beat TSMC? AMD needs Nvidia to fail... Intel just needs a Chinese invasion or large tariffs...  and chip tariffs are coming soon... I put better odds on Intel personally.

You saw just recently that US Steel asked Trump to raise the tariff. I think it is realistic then, since TSMC has asked for the chip tariff to not happen and Intel knows the tariff will hurt TSMC, Intel can petition for a high tariff on Taiwan fabs. And Trump will most likely agree. US Steel is arguably as cooked as Intel and yet it happened because at the end of the day, it's all about who owns the factories.

1l01ndh,2025-05-31,"UNH Comeback? Hemsley Returns, Optum Moat Intact  A Value Stock Worth Watching
UNH might look boring in an AI-crazed market, but boring makes money. With Hemsley back at the helm and Optum’s massive scale still unmatched, this is a cash-flow machine trading at just 13x forward earnings. In a world chasing hype, UNH offers real profits and defensive strength

 Healthcare spend keeps climbing UNH is built to ride that wave. Solid pick for long-term holders or value investors looking for quality on a dip




I think UNH is a steal at this price, but the I also think it will trade sideways for a while. How long are you willing to wait for gains?

Healthcare is also reputed to be recession-resistant, and stocks tend to be inflation-resistant, so if you're a bear for the next couple of years it might not be the worst place to stash some wealth.

I have a small position I bought near the bottom that I'm slowly growing as long as the stock stays low enough. Below 350, or 320, IDK - I'll watch and see what it does. I expect it to go to ~400, but not quickly. >CEO gets gunned down like a dog in the street

>Replacement CEO quits after a month

Yeah sounds great i’m in congress was buying it so I bought lmao  Yep - if you’ve got time to wait then buy buy buy. I am. Everyone on here will act like they did with Meta in 2022, but block out the noise. $400b a year in revenue and building up the healthcare side of their business (great year on year growth) massively to take advantage of an aging population is huge. It’s not going to be a 10x gain company, but well worth it at this price Not the replacement CEO. BT was the CEO of United Health, Inc. (UHC) Witte was the CEO of UNH- which includes both Optum and UHC. Helmsley is 72. He is not going to stay for more than 1-2 years.  Also, Optum is essentially a data company, not a HC company. It will never hit $200 Not only that, they are bringing back a buy that previously led the the unit that is in question now for fraud.  I wouldn't be surprised if he introduced the culture of over billing and claim denials to get UNH to where it's today. Also, if the DOJ antitrust investigation gains traction and UNH gets broken up, could unlock exponential value increase with separate stocks for Optum and UHC. Like everything is criminal, even google Agreed. And my take has been to try to swing it for now. I don't expect it to pop to 500 next week. So I'll take a slice here and there as the story develops. I'm not confident enough to carry a full position yet. But it also doesn't trade in line with my major plays currently so it presents a nice target for those swings, imo.

1kzx6ub,2025-05-31,"The case for $AMD.
Three days after Trump warned everyone not to do business with Huawei, China started slow walking rare earth exports.  China has also demanded the US ease the AI chip restrictions on purchases of $AMD and $NVDA chips.

The US must have rare earths from China. It is not optional.  

Potus will be compelled to settle this dispute to restart Chinese rare earth exports, leaving the AI chip restrictions behind mostly, or at least permitting other less powerful chips to be exported to China.

$AMD has a forward PE of 19 for 2026 earnings.  While $NVDA has a scorcher of 31 forward PE for 2026.

The case makes itself.  

FYI:  I am holding a shit ton of $AMD leaps.
When AMD was dropping, everyone on Reddit was buying. Iirc, Reddit was extremely bullish like 2 or 3 quarters ago before their earnings, only for it to extremely tank LOL 

Now that everyone is shitting on AMD, it might be gearing up for the bullrun of the century. Options is how you’ll get burned on AMD. Shares is way to go on this company NVDAs PE of 31 is not a ""scorcher."" its actually relatively fairly valued. AMD is ""cheap"" because their chips cant compete with NVDA The P/E is not the moat, Nvidia’s stack is Team red or team green. 

AMD makes the best CPUs, took the throne from intel and they are not letting up. They are going to be the first mover to the TSMC 1.4nm platform 

They moved away from monolithic and fully embraced the chiplet architecture, which I think is going to pay massive dividends for years to come. A lot of signs say that NVDA is going to move in that direction and they are a bit late to the party. 

AMD is arguably in a better postion for inference with cost per token lower than nvda and with the chiplet methodology,  will be able to quickly reduce costs and thus staying competitive. 

What AMD has historically lacked was software support and full soup to nuts rack solutions.  Which they are solving by their recent acquisitions. Their ROCm software is open source and has a massive team of engineers  working on the stack. 

Nvda did a absolutely amazing job of building CUDA and offering rack solutions for the first wave of AI. They saw the future and absolutely are the leader, no question. The problem is that they are slowly losing the advantage that CUDA gave them because open source virtually always wins. ROCm will, with almost 100% certainty be extremely comparable to CUDA, if not better in the years to come. 

AMD has the talent, leadership, technology, and has embraced open-source platforms. It doesn't have to be the leader, it just has to grab its small share in an extremely high margin, rapidly growing industry to be able to be a good, if not great investment at these levels. They have a good line of sight on 9b of fcf in the near term with great revenue growth projections (again, very good line of sight on this).  At 180b valuation it seems like an absolute steal.  

Everyone comparing this market to apple vs all in phones is so dumb because android has 70%+ global markets share.  There are essentially 2 companies that compete in GPU, and 2 in CPU.  New entery into the market is Extremely difficult and AMD is at the forefront of new silicone tech. I would be surprised if AMD doesn't grow REALITIVELY faster than NVDA for the next few years.

Please do not say TACO in response to this comment.  TACO might send Seal Team Six to make us stop saying TACO.

1kzhaox,2025-05-30,"Trump tells US steelworkers he’s going to double tariffs on foreign steel from 25% to 50%
No paywall: https://apnews.com/article/trump-us-steel-nippon-pennsylvania-7d8a252934abef553ca9ea7e9e8febc2

WEST MIFFLIN, Pa. (AP) — President Donald Trump says he’s going to double the tariff rate on steel to 50%, a dramatic increase that could further push up prices for a metal used to make housing, autos and other goods.

Trump was speaking Friday at U.S. Steel’s Mon Valley Works–Irvin Plant in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, to announce investments by Japan’s Nippon Steel.

The price of steel products has increased roughly 16% since Trump became president, according to the government’s producer price index.
[deleted] Just in time for Taco Tuesday! Taco triggered him to go tariff hard ¡Yo Quiero Taco Trump! [removed] [deleted] That would be hilarious if he did it on Thesday In 2018 Trump placed a massive tariff on steel from the UK. The UK responded by placing a massive tariff on US motorcycles.  Harley Davidson responded by shutting down a plant in the US and moving the work to Thailand.

Did he forget?

1ln3p6n,2025-06-29,"Whats the play with $UNH? Should I hold or sell or buy more ? Tempted to buy $25K worth of shares more on margin…talk me out of it or not

I think you should try to fart as loud as you can but try to avoid shitting your pants I mean if you're just buying shares who cares do whatever True stocks only go up😂 Just shares bro, send it. I'm not sure about using margin, but I think the stock is promising on the upside if the new CEO can execute on returning them to profitability. Lot of uncertainty in the interim though with regulatory scrutiny from DOJ,  questions about margins shrinking due to more people using their health insurance (as opposed to pandemic years), and overall negative press and having their name dragged through the mud - that's never good for any company, and I wouldn't be surprised if more people looked to switch to alternatives. However, that all being said, this company is huge and integral to the US healthcare industry, they also pay a dividend, and they are a cash printing machine with $400b revenue in 2024. 2026 will be big for them, that's the year a turnaround could logically begin to take shape. Don't expect it to shoot over $400 in the short term though. I now have 856 shares. I had 100 called away on Friday which I was planning to sell anyways. July 29 is earnings which the CEO stated would have future guidance. If there is a run up in price pre earnings I may sell another 200 off. Otherwise I am holding them through earnings and praying for good news as it is a fair chunk of my overall portfolio. I think the big risk is the OBBBA passing. There are projected cuts of 93 Billion in Medicaid. That will 100% impact UNH’s top & bottom line That's extremely easy to do unless you actually need to shit, so calls it is! I heard he got lost in Luigi’s Mansion or something like that. 929 Billion in Medicaid cuts: https://bsky.app/profile/jacobbogage.bsky.social/post/3lsotih47ic26 . But much of that doesn't start until 2028.


States either need to pick up to shortfall (new state taxes), 
 the USA gets a new government coalition that undoes the cuts, or lots of poor people loss insurance.


Impact short term is basically zilch though. Long term depends on one's outlook for how USA society will treat its poor when the majority of the cuts hit.

1lmq32d,2025-06-28,"NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE: SMR) Special Situation Analysis
First post on this sub and honestly most of Reddit. I have mainly been lurking for years but through my own individual research and 120+ total hours of daily (7 days a week) intense due diligence and research starting around May 21st, I stumbled into possibly one of the most enticing investment opportunities of the decade. Don't just read to the executive summary and try and poke holes. Read the whole thesis and at the very least, consider the ""investment committee"" rebuttals at the end. If you have done research into this field and have opinions to share or opposing research, please, let this be an open discussion!

Note: references to ""days of blackout"" or other timings are as of the afternoon of June 26, 2025.


Rating: **OVERWEIGHT** | Price Target: $120 (216% upside within 12 months) | Risk: **MEDIUM-HIGH**


**INVESTMENT THESIS SUMMARY**

We identify a high-probability convergence scenario whereby Apple Inc. announces a strategic nuclear partnership with NuScale Power within the next 1-45 days. Our analysis indicates this represents one of the most compelling asymmetric risk/reward opportunities in the current market, driven by simultaneous insider trading blackouts, regulatory catalysts, and Trump administration nuclear policy alignment.

Key Investment Highlights:

	•	Regulatory Moat: NuScale remains the only SMR with full Nuclear Regulatory Commission design certification
	•	Political Tailwinds: Trump’s May 23 executive orders create explicit framework for hyperscaler nuclear partnerships
	•	Corporate Necessity: Apple’s $500B AI infrastructure investment requires reliable baseload power
	•	Timing Convergence: 44-day Apple insider blackout + 27-day NuScale blackout suggests imminent announcement


**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

The convergence of corporate necessity (Apple’s AI energy demands), regulatory positioning (NuScale’s certification advantage), and political framework (Trump’s nuclear renaissance agenda) creates what we believe to be a generational investment opportunity. Our 30-day analysis reveals multiple validation points that have exponentially strengthened since thesis inception.

Base Case Scenario (70% probability): Apple-NuScale partnership announcement drives 200-300% appreciation

Bull Case Scenario (25% probability): Broader nuclear renaissance positioning drives 400-500% appreciation

Bear Case Scenario (5% probability): No partnership with any major player materializes, limited downside given current valuation ($20-$25/share)


**CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS**

Corporate Strategic Alignment
Apple’s AI Infrastructure Imperative: The company’s February $500B investment commitment includes data center expansion across nine states, requiring significant baseload power. Unlike hyperscaler peers (Meta, Microsoft, Google) who have secured nuclear partnerships, Apple represents the largest unpartnered AI infrastructure player.
NuScale’s Competitive Positioning: As the only NRC-certified SMR provider with manufacturing capabilities (12 modules in production via Doosan partnership), NuScale possesses an unassailable regulatory moat that becomes increasingly valuable as hyperscaler nuclear demand accelerates.

Political Economy Framework
Trump’s nuclear executive orders create unprecedented policy support for private-sector nuclear partnerships, particularly those supporting AI infrastructure. The administration’s goal of 400 GW nuclear capacity by 2050 requires massive private investment, making high-profile corporate partnerships politically essential for demonstrating market viability.

Insider Trading Pattern Analysis
The simultaneous 44-day Apple blackout (unprecedented duration) and 27-day NuScale blackout (beginning immediately post-Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval) represents statistically anomalous corporate behavior consistent with major strategic transaction negotiations.


**FINANCIAL MODELING & VALUATION**

Revenue Impact Analysis

	•	Single Apple Partnership: $2-5B annual contract value over 20 years
	•	Market Validation Effect: Additional hyperscaler partnerships following Apple announcement
	•	Manufacturing Scale: Doosan partnership capable of 20+ modules annually (as of deal signing in 2023)

**INVESTMENT COMMITTEE Q&A**

Q: Dependency on corporate execution - what if Apple/NuScale partnership doesn’t materialize?

Response: This concern misunderstands the anthropological drivers at play. Tim Cook’s psychology operates on legacy positioning - he will not allow Apple to fall behind in the infrastructure arms race that defines AI leadership. Hopkins, as a Chamber of Commerce-embedded operator, understands that first-mover partnerships with Apple create market validation that benefits NuScale regardless of subsequent deal flow.
The convergence isn’t dependent on corporate whim - it’s driven by structural necessity. Apple needs nuclear, NuScale has the only certified solution, and Trump’s framework removes regulatory barriers. Even if this specific partnership fails, the thesis benefits from multiple pathways: government acquisition, other hyperscaler partnerships, or broader nuclear adoption all drive similar outcomes.

Q: Political risk - what if Trump’s priorities shift away from nuclear?

Response: Trump’s ego architecture makes nuclear reversal psychologically impossible. He’s publicly committed to “American energy dominance” and 400 GW nuclear capacity - reversing course would contradict his core political identity. More importantly, Hopkins understands the political machine through his Chamber positioning. The nuclear renaissance isn’t just Trump policy - it’s bipartisan infrastructure necessity driven by AI competition with China.
Nuclear power represents Trump’s ability to simultaneously claim “America First” energy independence and technological superiority. These are core psychological drivers that don’t shift with news cycles. The framework is locked in place by Trump’s legacy needs.

Q: Regulatory timing risk - Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval doesn’t guarantee deployment certainty

Response: This assumes static regulatory environment, which misreads the political moment. Trump’s executive orders explicitly direct agencies to expedite nuclear deployment and establish categorical NEPA exclusions. Hopkins’ background suggests he’s positioned for regulatory navigation - not regulatory compliance gambling.
The May 29 Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval timing (immediately before insider blackouts) suggests coordination between regulatory completion and commercial announcement. This isn’t speculative - it’s orchestrated regulatory theater designed to create deployment certainty. The political framework eliminates traditional regulatory uncertainty.

Q: Market efficiency - if this is obvious, why isn’t it already priced in?

Response: Market efficiency assumes perfect information distribution, which fails with multi-dimensional convergence analysis. The pattern requires simultaneously tracking: insider trading behavior, regulatory timelines, political anthropology, and corporate strategic necessities. Most analysts operate in single-factor frameworks.
Additionally, the 30-day research depth required to identify this convergence exceeds typical institutional attention spans. Market makers have micro-timing advantages but lack macro-convergence pattern recognition. The information is public, but the interpretive sophistication required creates genuine asymmetry.
The psychological timing also matters - announcing before July 4 maximizes political impact while minimizing opposition organization time. This level of strategic timing analysis exceeds normal market efficiency assumptions.
This convergence represents genuine analytical edge, not market inefficiency exploitation.


RECOMMENDATION

OVERWEIGHT rating with 3-5% portfolio allocation for aggressive growth mandates. The combination of regulatory positioning, political tailwinds, and corporate necessity creates exceptional asymmetric opportunity with institutional-quality risk management potential.

Price Target: $120 (12-month horizon)

***TECHNICAL ANALYSIS VALIDATION/CONVERGENCE***

Ascending Triangle Formation

The target security exhibits a textbook ascending triangle pattern with compelling technical characteristics that independently validate our fundamental catalyst timeline.

Pattern Structure:

	•	Horizontal resistance: Consistent rejection at $45.31 level over multiple tests since early June
	•	Rising support trendline: Higher lows pattern from $29.45 base indicating systematic accumulation behavior
	•	Volume compression: Decreasing volatility range suggesting institutional positioning ahead of known catalyst
	•	Apex convergence: Pattern completion anticipated within 3-6 trading days

Institutional Significance:

The ascending triangle represents more than technical pattern recognition - it demonstrates institutional anticipation of our identified catalyst events. The rising support trendline indicates smart money accumulation at progressively higher prices, suggesting advance knowledge of pending announcements. Volume analysis reveals institutional-size block trading concentrated at key support levels, consistent with strategic positioning rather than retail speculation.

Catalyst Alignment Validation:

The technical pattern convergence timing provides independent confirmation of our fundamental analysis. The 3-6 day apex timing aligns precisely with:

	•	Trump’s July 4th symbolic opportunity window
	•	Apple’s 44-day insider blackout approaching natural conclusion
	•	Political necessity for immediate manufacturing narrative wins

This convergence represents what technical analysts call “smart money confirmation” - when institutional behavior validates fundamental thesis timing through observable market mechanics.
Breakout Probability Assessment:
Ascending triangles historically resolve upward in 70-80% of cases, with breakout magnitude typically correlating to pattern duration and volume compression intensity. The current formation demonstrates:

	•	4-week consolidation period: Extended enough to absorb selling pressure
	•	Multiple resistance tests: Each rejection followed by higher low formation
	•	Volume contraction: Institutional accumulation without retail distribution

Price Target Methodology:

Technical analysis provides multiple target frameworks:

	•	Initial breakout objective: $60+ (33% above $45.31 resistance, representing gap-fill to prior highs)
	•	Measured move calculation: $75-85 (pattern height of ~$16 projected from breakout point)
	•	Fundamental convergence target: $120 (enterprise value analysis of strategic partnership implications)

The technical setup suggests the initial breakout could reach $60-65 within days of catalyst announcement, with fundamental revaluation driving appreciation toward the $120 enterprise value target over subsequent quarters.

Information Asymmetry Evidence:

Perhaps most significantly, the ascending triangle formation demonstrates market anticipation of our identified catalysts. The pattern suggests institutional players possess advance knowledge of pending announcements, creating the exact information asymmetry that generates exceptional investment returns. The technical behavior validates our insider blackout analysis and political timing thesis through independent market confirmation.
This technical validation transforms our fundamental analysis from theoretical possibility into market-confirmed probability, with institutional positioning behavior providing real-time verification of our catalyst timeline accuracy.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

who tf is ‘we’?.

Not intending to be mean here but you’re basing a lot on this Apple prediction. I hope it happens, and it’ll pump if it does, but Nuscale is already pumped to the tits. Your AI generated ‘thesis’ basically says: if the Apple deal doesn’t happen, some other good thing will probably happen.

Like, what? 

I have a position (shares) similar size to yours but I won’t buy any more over $20 This company hasn’t built a single plant if I’m correct From what I understand their first ""approved"" reactor was just the design back in 2017. It was hyped up a lot as ""the only smr reactor in the USA to reach this level of approval"" but if you dug deeper, they actually weren't allowed to build as-is and needed to rework for further approval to actually build. It was found to have safety issues that were not addressed and when Romania and Idaho contracted to build with them, they found significant resistance, rising costs and they weren't as ready as they hyped up. Both those contracts were cancelled when faced with the reality of where NuScale actually was at. 

This new reactor design seems to have only passed approval...because they made the approval process easier. 

Does anyone know if they actually fixed the issues with their smaller reactor with this design or are they just rinse and repeating the process? Did they find a way to actually make it cheaper or is whomever contracts going to find the same issues with rising costs and undisclosed technical issues to be a barrier for actually building? Why didn't they continue/approve their initial reactor which had a much longer history of R&D behind it? 

IMO; the company has a history of hyping themselves up, running out of money, laying off their entire workforce save for a skeleton crew of execs looking for further funding, securing enough funding for a couple years and hiring people back. I don't think their engineering team is very cohesive ""under the hood"" and I don't think their execs are running a good business. 

It might skyrocket with an actual deal...but their history doesn't paint a very solid picture. The royal we, man... Priced in

If nothing materializes I expect SMR to go down to 25 over the next few months $OKLO

It definitely takes guts to invest in these reactor designers. **HOWEVER**, these are fundamentally different plays:

OKLO: Microreactors targeting DoD/military applications (forward bases, naval propulsion, remote operations). Still pre-NRC application submission, 3-5+ year timeline. Unfortunately, they keep getting their applications flat out rejected. See 7 months ago (Atomic Alchemy-OKLO subsidiary since Feb 2025):

https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML2431/ML24311A058.pdf

NuScale: 77MW SMRs are designed for hyperscaler partnerships and commercial baseload power. Only NRC-certified SMR, modules in production, ready for 2026+ deployment.

My intuition: Retail seems to be chasing (and Wall Street appears to be nudging) OKLO’s “next-gen” narrative while missing NuScale’s immediate commercial opportunity. They have different customer bases entirely - Apple (or other AI hyperscalers) need(s) scalable baseload power for data centers, not microreactors for military bases.
If you believe in July-August hyperscaler catalyst timing, only NuScale can deliver validated power purchase agreements on that scale. OKLO could *potentially* be the better 5-10 year speculative play, but NuScale sits atop the hyperscaler market right now. If it does, I'll buy at 25. Interesting.  Bought some SMR a few weeks ago after I sold it 9 months ago.

1lmal1e,2025-06-28,"OpenAI taps Google Cloud TPUs in bid to diversify AI chip supply

It’s incredible how people don’t see just how set up for AI domination Google is. 

They’re literally the only company that can actually vertically integrate this shit.

Who else has data on 8B people and the literal Tower of Babel when it comes to video content to train their models This is the holy Grail and GOOG is so undervalued. They literally own the infrastructure to run their own models, from the silicon to the datacenters to the data itself; meanwhile competitors have to rent GPUs to run their stuff. Heck they are even heavily invested and leading quantum computers. Another thing worth mentioning is that their TPUs have been getting better and better every generation. It's only a matter of time before GOOG stops using NVIDIA GPUs all together. I was thinking to myself that GOOGL and AMZN and AAPL have had it rough the past month and are next to break ATHs. Maybe this is where it happens, my GOOGL calls went from -10k to +3.4k in a week Side note: google doesn’t use nvida gpu’s for their llm they buy them in bulk for their cloud division so they’ll likely always buy from nvidia but google itself doesn’t need nvidia for these things. I agree and I think it cannot be overstated just how significant it is that OpenAI is even entertaining using something other than NVDA hardware, even more so settling for an older generation of Alphabet’s in house chips. 

This is not priced in yet for either GOOG or NVDA. I’d expect to start seeing some weakness in NVDA if we keep getting more news about new collabs like this. You are correct, GOOG runs their llms in their TPUs. But they still purchase a ton of Nvidia GPUs because some customers actually demand them. My point is that once GOOG TPUs and llms become more efficient, there won't be much of a need for power hungry Nvidia GPUs. Nvidia is sold OUT. They will alwqys be sold out.

This delusion has to stop lmao. Can good get to 200 already For me, this is the biggest risk factor for NVDA.  They don't manufacture anything themselves, and all of their biggest customers are in a race to design their own custom silicon that will then be manufactured by TSM/INTC.  Could be a problem - or maybe NVDA will just stay so far out in the lead the custom silicon designs won't ever take off, or maybe it's even bullish that amzn/goog/meta/msft will hire NVDA to design their own proprietary custom silicon.

This escalated quickly 
This is incorrect. Its because OpenAI is choosing to use google TPUs to lower training costs. Goog has had a plethora of PT hikes over the past few months. OpenAI using their chips and TPUv8 architecture means that the market will now realize they’ve overlooked a legitimate sleeper.

It’s been on a vertical tear since earnings. It’s clearly one of the biggest AI players, but the stock is tired and needs to cool off. RSI peaks have been dropping to lower lows as the stock has made higher highs.  I made a similar callout back in February before Walmarts earnings while the RSI on the indices was doing the same thing.  The whole market is frothy right now, and I think we see a small to moderate correction soon when inflation readings start coming in hotter than expected and stagflation becomes the main topic of discussion.  Finally, Webush, arguably the most regarded analyst group, came out with a $600 target this morning. That’s my cue to buy puts.

1lk8qm3,2025-06-25,"reddit is invading india harder than the redcoats
TL;DR - Reddit switched on machine translation for India on 28 Apr 2025, thereby exposing the world’s second-largest internet market to r/WallStreetBets. The chart above shows how Google is now funneling record numbers of new traffic (and thus new users) to Reddit.

India is a huge country. It doubles U.S. user counts on both YouTube and Facebook. Yet India is less than one-third the size of US users on Reddit. The upside here is thus enormous. If you overlay India’s early search-traffic curve on the launch-to-date growth for France, Spain, Colombia, Mexico, and Brazil, India is clearly sprinting past every precedent.

The model I created on May 13 assumed France-style adoption rates (the yellow projection line). The latest Semrush data shows India blowing through that benchmark (the white dotted projection line).

Add in the bullish Anthropic lawsuit, the now-GA dynamic product ads feature, and Reddit Answers traction, their current \~20% sh\*rt int\*r\*st is starting to feel a tad mis-priced.
Looks a lot more like “India invading Reddit” than “Reddit invading India” Hence any posts that don't take India's side in geopolitical affairs getting downvoted to oblivion in most of the major news subs lol Thats just where all the bots come from. I constantly *mute* these subs and they still pop back up Oh that's why I see so many Indian investing subs now. Another mystery solved When this happened to Quora, the quality of content went down fast. Became very India centric.

1lk6mzw,2025-06-25,"Can Veo 3 have a meaningful impact on googles next earnings?
I can’t scroll Insta without seeing some AI-generated video from Veo 3. If you don’t know, Veo 3 is Google’s AI video generator, and it costs something like €250/month as part of their AI subscription. this thing is everywhere. I’m seeing 3-4 reels a day.

Hedge fund managers stand no chance against us here bc they probably don’t spend 5 hours a day scrolling through AI brainrot.

So I’m sitting here thinking—could this actually juice Google’s earnings? Like, are we talking a meaningful beat because of all the subscription revenue from Veo 3?
No, Veo 3 low quality mode is free, you’re likely seeing the free tier everywhere Earnings? Not unless they're carrying forward expected subs.  They'll trumpet the nearly million new 250$ tier subs though.  that'll cause a pop I think. > ai artist


Lmao Google is one of the best Mag7 plays. 

- Gemini and everything generative is absolutely on point. And Google is an actual business that cares about costs per token so they are spending on this with some thought to ROI. 
- Waymo is a leader
- Cloud
- Gmail/Sheets and all potential AI interactions
- YouTube is silly big

Google is a great opportunity, IMO. Yeah, I'm seeing Veo 3 slop everywhere now and that's just the stuff i figured out was veo 3. There's clips where you can't tell if it's generated or real free Veo3 version doesn't exist. Veo2 is free, but Veo2 sucks. Nearly million? Nearly my ASS there’s zero chance of that. They have a million new Gemini AI Pro subs, not a million AI Pro subs unless you have evidence? 

Calls if so This is what made me do this post. Its crazy how mamy veo3 videos are there on reels and probably tiktok also veo 3 has a free 1 month trial - rinse and repeat new email address every month Google One had 150M paid subscribers in May 2025, up from 100M paid subscribers in Feb 2025. 

It’s not disclosed how many of those subscribers are paying for Gemini. Could be the $1 monthly storage tier. 

But that 50M bump is pretty interesting that it lines up with Gemini.

1lhqpwk,2025-06-22,"$60K on TSLA Puts:  Why TSLA Will Be Down Big Next Few Weeks.
In no particular order:

- Iran news completely overshadows the Robotaxi launch which was likely a sell-the-news event anyways.

- Weekend fake internet money prices point to a selloff in stocks.  TSLA highly correlated to fake internet money.

- TX senate vote and signature of Governor requiring all autonomous vehicles to get to Level autonomy in order to operate starting in September.  This is a huge precedent which now means TSLA robotaxis will take much longer to scale because each State will have its own autonomous driving thresholds and review periods.  Waymo will continue to expand faster than TSLA.

- Attention now shifts to July 22 earnings.  Sales are pretty much down YoY throughout most of the entire world.  Analyst downgrades are coming.  TSLA will likely lower full year guidance.

- I expect a class action lawsuit from disgruntled HW3 owners soon because they are all realizing Elon lied about HW3 getting a free upgrade to HW4 and beyond.  It is clear now that HW3 vehicles wont ever have true FSD and the legal liability will be in the tens of billions of dollars.

- Elon is still popping off about one of Mango’s closest White House aides.  The probability of Elon pissing off Mango again is not insignificant.

- $7,500 EV Tax Credit likely expires at the end of this year.

- Oil spike likely means Fed delays rate cuts further.  High P/E stocks like TSLA generally suffer more in higher rate environments especially if economic growth is also slowing.


The only flaw in your logic is that you're being logical.  I've been burned betting against TSLA when I expected things like a terrible revenue/earnings report to actually be considered a negative.  Everything bad seems to be good. you just listed 8 reasons why tsla stock will magically go up Yup, TSLA defies all logic. I can only assume it is traded in almost every fund held by IRAs, 401ks, etc so it's ""too big to fail"" GL bro. Tesla Puts SHOULD print, hence why they probably won’t. Makes perfect sense. Calls it is. Believe it not, calls just lost 20k more  by 10am. Yea, a driverless tesla could have ploughed into a school but people would still buy because Musk promises to show next month that Grok reached singularity. Yeah, I got burned last quarter when TSLA EPS were like 35% below estimates and then it mooned. TSLA won't be able to cheat death forever, but I'm done betting against it Learned my lesson buying puts on this nonsense stock only for Elon to be the only force to make them print.

Alright regards, I'm back after mentally recovering from paper handing my TSLA puts on possibly the craziest timed DD ever right before Orange tragically dumped Enron (check out my profile if you wanna read through that clusterfuck). With help from my AI therapist, I've recovered and I've moved on to the next play.

Today's topic is CLBR: a right-wing SPAC merger taking GrabAGun public into the ticker PEW (think Star Wars like how those guns go pew pew, pretty dope) so grab a strong drink and sit down cuz we're gonna be comparing it to DJT and how CLBR is likely to mimic that merger but with extra regard strength.

**Status of CLBR merger:**  
CLBR just submitted their 3rd revision of the S-4 (form the SEC requires for mergers). I did a PDF comparison between the 2nd and 3rd revision. They didn't change much, mostly cosmetic stuff as well as some extra outlined risks the SEC probably asked for. The document looks pretty solid. Therefore, I believe it is extremely close to getting approved by the SEC. I estimate it could be as soon as tomorrow. If not tomorrow, definitely next week.

When the S-4 was approved in the DJT merger, DWAC (the sponsor company like how CLBR is the sponsor company for GrabAGun) jumped something like 14%. Not bad.

**What happens after S-4 approval?**  
The shareholders will schedule a date to vote on the merger (spoilers, they will vote yes). When this was announced in the DJT merger, stock fell like 7% ish. Then when the actual merge date was announced, it initially rose then fell something like 14% on the news.

If the same happens with CLBR this will likely be a great entry point for anyone that missed out on S-4 approval. I'm probably going to increase my position if this happens.

**What happens on merge date?**  
We all know what happened to DJT, it made a lot of lucky fucks very wealthy.

***The risk-reward here is just too good to pass up imo.***

**BONUS POINTS**  
That's right regards, I'm not done so grab another drink if you need it.

**Orange Jr.**  
He's directly involved in this merger. We all know how much that family loves to cause a good pump (and eventually dump).

**Financials**  
Unlike Truth Social at the time, GrabAGun is an actual profitable, positive cash flow company. That means that this merger is likely to benefit from both the **meme stock regards (us)** as well as **actual smart investors (not us/other people)**.

In other words, this merger is gonna have both **regard strength** and **fundamental strength**. I wish I could say the same about myself but unfortunately I'm only regard strength.

**Bank Policies**  
Banks are changing their policies with respect to getting involved with companies in the firearms business. And who caused this change? That's right, Mr. Orange Man himself.

Headline: ""Citigroup Reverses Its Firearms Policy Months After Trump Called Out U.S. Banks. Here’s What to Know""

Pretty good timing for a company like GrabAGun, especially considering Orange's son (Orange Jr.) is directly involved. I wonder what else he could say to pump the shit out of this?

**Wartime and Political Uncertainty**  
What do people buy when they think WW3 is about to drop harder than a Drake album? Guns.

**Kelly Reisdorf Added to Board of Directors**  
She's the CEO of USA Shooting, I see future revenue streams opening up with this.

**What my AI Therapist has to say after I told it to do hella research:**  
""VI. Strategic Conclusion for the Sophisticated Investor

The public offerings of DJT, PEW, and NMAX signal the maturation of a distinct and challenging asset class: the politically-branded meme stock. These investment vehicles are defined less by their products or financial statements and more by a powerful narrative that transcends business fundamentals, a reliance on a central political figurehead, and a dedicated base of retail investors who view their participation as an ideological act.

For DJT, the narrative *is* the product; its valuation is a direct reflection of sentiment surrounding Donald Trump, with little to no underlying business to support it. For NMAX, a similar political narrative combined with a low-float IPO structure fueled a brief but spectacular speculative frenzy. The pending PEW merger represents the next evolution of this model. Here, the political narrative serves as a powerful marketing wrapper and valuation accelerant for what appears to be a tangible, profitable underlying business.

The crucial takeaway for the sophisticated investor is the necessity of a dual-track analysis. Traditional fundamental analysis—evaluating revenue, profitability, cash flow, and competitive positioning—remains essential for understanding the long-term viability of the enterprise. However, it is insufficient on its own. It must be paired with an equally rigorous analysis of the political narrative's strength, the loyalty of the retail investor base, and the technical factors, like share float and lock-up periods, that can drive short-term volatility.

The interplay, and often the direct conflict, between these two value drivers—fundamental reality and political narrative—will ultimately determine the stock's trajectory. Investing in these entities is not merely a bet on a company's success; it is a complex and high-risk wager on the direction, intensity, and durability of a political movement.""

**EDIT TO INCLUDE COMMENT:**  
Also worth mentioning: with this being firearms and Orange Jr.-related, there's bound to be some controversy. Especially if this gains traction. More news = more pump, especially if say Fox or NewsMax covers it and the rednecks start buying it up.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER

Dude, not gonna read that. Could've just stopped after CLBR calls. Yes, CLBR / PEW will be the meme of 2025 In as well with July and October calls. These Trump grift SPACs have paid massively the last two times. So I’m not risking missing out on this. Trump jr is involved, that alone means DJT will pull some strings to make it successful. Maybe partnering up with DoorDash, who knows. You don't know what a meme is then. We haven't seen any since DWAC jumped from $10 to $175 in 2 days and this will be the same cult buying it on IPO day.

1lfchc3,2025-06-19,"Coreweave 9-19 $150 csps for 192k premium
Wrote 30 crwv (coreweave) 9/19 $150 csps (cash secured puts) for $62/share premium and 1 crwv 9/19 $150 csp for $64.1/share premium. Max profit $192k, max loss if coreweave goes to 0 is $273k. The $192k premium and $465k “cash” are in money market collecting 4 percent interest, which will yield another $6,700 between now and 9/19.

There are 64 more trading days left between now and expiration, IV is at 107%, 8-9% short position relative to float. Currently nvda holds a 7% stake in coreweave and a strategic partnership, which was partially responsible for the run up. Below is a summary of the partnership from nvda:

“The general availability of NVIDIA GB200 NVL72-based instances on CoreWeave underscores the latest in the companies’ collaboration, focused on delivering the latest accelerated computing solutions to the cloud. With the launch of these instances, enterprises now have access to the scale and performance needed to power the next wave of AI reasoning models and agents.

Customers can start provisioning GB200 NVL72-based instances through CoreWeave Kubernetes Service in the US-WEST-01 region using the gb200-4x instance ID. To get started, contact CoreWeave.”

Coreweave owns data centers in the US and Canada including the fastest super computer in the world that is powered by nvda chips. The strategic partnership (as well as ownership stake) gives coreweave dibs on the latest nvda chips, which gives coreweave a leg up over its competitors. In addition to Nvda, Microsoft is another major client. It is my opinion that we are just at the beginning of an AI arms race, coreweave is in a fantastic position to reap  the benefits from money from both private and public sectors indiscriminately flowing into anything related to AI. 

Biggest concerns include 1) 325% 3 months run making coreweave susceptible to major pull back, and 2) geopolitical tensions and tariff wars may tank the market. 

However, the concerns are short term, and are alleviated by the large premium (my break even is $87.94), the stock would need to drop almost 50% from Wednesday close for me to incur a loss. Worst case scenario, I am forced to buy 3,100 shares at a loss, I will sell covered calls and wheel my way to profitability. 

Best case scenario is that coreweave closes in the $150 range with high IV on 9/19 and I get to run it back again, while collecting more premium and interest.

Scalping usually requires very careful observation of your position and strong contingencies in the case it doesn’t work, like a -10% stop loss on all contracts. I might be a noob, help me understand. Did you buy the contracts today? Why the fuck were they so cheap if the strike price was so close to the day opening?

ATH Soon? While META has done okay this year, I believe it will make new highs soon. ZUCK is pulling all kinds of levers in the money machine (Whatsapp monetization) and the longer a stock trades sideways or down and the more $ it makes, the more undervalued it becomes.

May see a pump from this oakley/meta collab as well. Aiming to sell for a 8-10% gain, 750-770
When you buy at or above fair value for a large, well-established company, you have to wait for gains. Furthermore, “the longer a stock trades sideways or down and the more $ it makes, the more undervalued it becomes”, is completely false. Meta sells tons of ads, like GOOG, which trades at a near-20 P/E. Meta prints fat stacks of cash for sure, but they could continue doing so and be brought down in price to near $500/share or worse if hype for the future of the company dies down. And as the controlling shareholder (voting wise) gets older and the company doesn’t prop up a future heir, then what in the world should investors be excited about? Metaverse? More ads? Please do tell. 20k 🤷🏼‍♂️ i smell a split coming soon GOOG isn't a great comparison, its PE is compressed due to ongoing antitrust litigation. META isn't priced at $700 per share due to hype. TTM PE of \~27 isn't ""HYPE"", its pricing in solid growth in the future. Zuck is 41 and in great health. META will only find more levers to pull to monetize their massive user base, and the stock price likely will go to ATH as the market continues to rally. I agree, Meta is a solid money maker. Was buying during the dip and calls going great.

Aaaaahhhh yes. Gather round children. Let me tell you the tale of a man who entered Zuck at $45 and finally pulled out at $450. 
Do I regret it? No. 
Did I invest that money successfully? Yes. Amazing gains bro well done P/E of 27 definitely is some hype, as you say there is an expectation for solid growth, but not outsized growth. Solid growth in existing products isn’t a way to convince investors that the company is capable of doubling, tripling, quadrupling its profit in the future, which is what will ultimately drive the higher valuations you seek. And I don’t buy that GOOGs P/E is compressed due to antitrust litigation, not completely anyway. Regardless, Meta is also currently involved in antitrust litigation. I’m sure both cases will ultimately be dropped as TikTok gains market share and google search experiences headwinds.

I have no stake in either company, long or short. Pulling levers to monetize an existing user base is a great way to improve margins, but I fear the company that focuses on growth through margin expansion, because it tells me they are entering an era of fear and uncertainty for their core business. While most people I know are half-addicted to instagram, whether that is a business model worthy of a high valuation is not my call to make. My opinion only. I didn’t have cash to invest in 2022, but I would have. For me it would’ve been short term, like me buying oil December 2020.

1ldmxys,2025-06-17,"Sunrun -35%, SolarEdge -30%, First Solar -16% as Senate Bill Cuts Green Incentives, EV Credit Ends Early
No paywall: [https://www.investors.com/news/solar-stocks-dive-senate-bill-cuts-solar-wind-energy-incentives/?src=A00220](https://www.investors.com/news/solar-stocks-dive-senate-bill-cuts-solar-wind-energy-incentives/?src=A00220)

Solar stocks such as Sunrun (RUN), SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) and First Solar (FSLR) plunged overnight after the newly released Senate budget bill would keep a full phase-out of solar and wind energy tax credits by 2028.

The GOP-led Senate Finance Committee late Monday unveiled changes to the Trump budget bill that passed the House, but left the wind-down of solar and wind incentives.

Sunrun stock dived 35.4% early Tuesday, with SolarEdge down 30.3%, Enphase Energy (ENPH) 19.9% and First Solar stock 16.3%. Array Technologies (ARRY) gave up 13.7%, Shoals Technologies (SHLS) 10.1% and Nextracker (NXT) 13.8%. Nextera Energy (NEE) lost 2.8%.

A decline in solar and wind projects could affect demand for battery storage. But Fluence Energy (FLNC) rose 3.%.

Tesla (TSLA) has a notable storage business under Tesla Energy while the Senate bill would end the $7,500 tax credit for EVs 180 days after becoming law. That's vs. the House's end-of-2025 cut-off. Tesla stock dipped 0.6% in premarket action.
Which senators, insiders etc. sold? Yesterday there were a lot of suspiciously large weekly put plays made on FSLR that went 10x this AM


Like someone buying over $2m of 6/20 puts at once


People for sure knew something was coming Someone bought 6k contracts of $40 ENPH weekly puts yesterday (about 10%) OTM and closed today, turned $305k to $3.3 million

1lcrrsr,2025-06-16,"Reddit unveils AI-driven ad tools to help brands tap into user discussions
June 16 (Reuters) - Reddit launched two new AI-powered advertising features on Monday aimed at helping brands drive greater engagement by tapping user conversations on the platform, the company said.

The company said its AI-driven tool, ""Reddit Insights"", would provide real-time insights to marketers for planning campaigns by identifying trends on the platform and testing campaign ideas.

It will also provide a feature called ""Conversation Summary Add-ons"", allowing brands to integrate ""positive"" user comments directly under the ads to show what they think about the ad subject.

Platforms such as Reddit, Snap (SNAP.N), opens new tab and Pinterest (PINS.N), opens new tab are leaning on AI-driven ad targeting tools to attract marketers in a fiercely competitive ad market amid economic uncertainties.
Reddit's announcement comes after WPP Media trimmed its forecast for global ad revenue growth to 6% from its prior target of 7.7% due to uncertainties related to changing U.S. trade policies.

Brands are expected to prioritize flexible ad contracts and accelerate the adoption of AI tools in ad production and user targeting, the media investment arm of ad group WPP (WPP.L), opens new tab said last week.

Last month, Reddit forecast second quarter revenue above Wall Street estimates, but CEO Steve Huffman said the company expected some disruption for traffic from Google search.
Reddit also launched new content moderation and analytics tools in March, aimed at helping people adhere to community rules and better understand content performance.

Check out these awesome, super cool black mirrors on sale at Amazon. com! > It will also provide a feature called ""Conversation Summary Add-ons"", allowing brands to integrate ""positive"" user comments directly under the ads to show what they think about the ad subject.

The only difference is that reddit now want a piece of the pie rather then have some Indian callcenter spam son stories on /Guycry or /Pics for cheap karma.


And whenever I need more karma to comment I buy mine from KarmaAI, the most reasonable prices and actually Indian upvotes /s Would not be shocked to Klarna ads on those posts. I saw that.

1lcinu5,2025-06-16,"$ACDC: Near-term 100 Bagger on Oil
# TLDR: Calls on $ACDC (ProFrac). If Oil goes to $100 a barrel or higher, it will go up over 100%. I'm expecting the Oil Algos to cause a Squeeze.


(Beware this is likely regarded)

**Intro:**

I'm the one who made the discussion post about the **Strait of Hormuz**. Basically, I think the oil market is mis-pricing this **catastrophic event**. I'm sure we've all seen the headlines. JP Morgan's simulations show that oil could reach **$120-$130** a barrel. It may be unlikely, but I think the odds are **non-zero.** While it is illiquid, **Polymarket has it at a 34% chance** at the time of writing. If Israel hits **Kharg Island,** Oil will skyrocket. It's safe to say, you can't find lottery tickets with odds like that.. **If the Strait is closed, or is seriously threatened, this could be a generational play**.

Now, there are dozens of tickers that give exposure to this, but I'm a **GREEDY** fuck. Even if it's a long-shot, I want exposure to the **maximum possible lotto**. Out of all the possible tickers, **$ACDC** is my favorite. It could easily go up **200-300%** from here if Oil makes any sudden large moves..

# $ACDC: Why?

I'll keep it simple, please consult the Google charts:

https://preview.redd.it/ksp6jkzri77f1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=bebb4fc4156a1f6b4596379da269704db973c9ae

https://preview.redd.it/1j9m2idti77f1.png?width=1514&format=png&auto=webp&s=32adad5615f27bb871a1e6687aad8e8c8ebdec37

Basically, **$ACDC** is highly correlated with oil prices. Instead of wasting our time putting it in my own words, here's what **Claude** says about their business model:

https://preview.redd.it/qimrp73wi77f1.png?width=1586&format=png&auto=webp&s=4403470e8248a6a167f6f0f2d1c0d0499fb4b5db

One important thing to note is the business becomes profitable at **$80** a barrel of WTI. This goes up massively at **$90, $100**, etc. That's basically the gist of it. Now for the fun part..

# Why it will Moon More Than Others:

Out of all the oil tickers, this one has the best setup for a big move. Here is the [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ACDC&p=d) Data:

https://preview.redd.it/356qfcfyi77f1.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb497e4ed96f143eb23add87569e52d3d4312f67

* **Insider Ownership of 93.10%**
* **Institutional Ownership of 8.45%**
* **11.06m Shares Float**
* **Short Float Interest of 36.25%**
* **Short Interest of 4.01m Shares \^**

While surveying the dozens of tickers expected to move on oil going up, this one caught my eye. This mechanical setup lends itself to explosive gains. Based on the current option prices, this is a potential **100 bagger**. The price estimations for **$ACDC** at **$120 a barrel** put it over $20 a share.

The kicker is that if Oil makes an explosive move, **Algos will buy up these stocks like crazy**. It won't hold, but I think the Algos could easily send this stock to **over $30 a share**. The buying would be extraordinary. I want to take advantage of this..

**To be clear, Reddit will not move this stock**. This is all based on the price of oil. I just think the mechanical setup provides a nice lottery ticket in case of Oil emergencies. I plan to sit back and let the algos do their thing. I just expect this stock to jump much more than others on **the day of** an oil spike.

# Positions:

**This is a small position! It's just a lottery ticket**. Depending on the situation in the Middle East, I will buy more on expiration. If the stock goes over 20, the 12c will 100x!

10c Jun 20th .21 avg
12c Jun 20th .09 avg

(Note: This is not a reddit squeeze, this just has mechanics for a massive move from Algos. It stood out to me as the best mechanics from any of the oil plays. Also, this is not financial advice and is likely quite stupid.)

(Edit: When I say 100 bagger, I'm talking about the options.. If oil goes to $120 a barrel, these positions will be a 100x)
Why don't you just buy calls on oil I thought this was WSB.. I'm not buying leaps 🎰 I really like how you gave yourself 4.9 days to be right IM ON THE HIIIIGGGHHHHWWAAAAYYYYY TO WENDYS. [deleted] Be ready to take a big haircut on the bid-ask when you are selling these back, trading these low liquidity chains is tricky. Especially short duration options like this. I trade similar options chains on biotech tickers and have learned to buy longer contracts, you will sometimes spend days nickel and diming to get a fill you can accept. You are at the mercy of MM's with these FDs. These options have pretty much no fucking liquidity though

You're two days and 6% off from your buy in on a 35 DTE play. If you've already lost confidence in it, you shouldn't have taken this to begin with.

We're either gonna be green red or flat tomorrow >I'm just scared because of how much $ I put in before close on Friday.

Then you shouldn't have entered this. Some real talk here, don't put yourself in a position where you're emotionally invested in the outcome. You should have a strategy. You should know why you're entering, and what's going to make you exit on both the upside and downside. Neither of those exits should be something you're going to be overly ecstatic or unhappy with.

Even the really good trading strategies tend to have like a 5% edge. That means 45% of all trades will result in a loss. They come out ahead because over the course of many, many trades the odds put them into profit. 

If you're sizing positions to the point that you're scared of losing it, then you aren't playing the odds. You're betting it on black and hoping. If you are sizing properly and are still worried, then you don't have confidence in your strategy, so rethink why you're trading it.

1larewn,2025-06-13,"Road to Recovery - 70.8% DAY
After a few soul-crushing days of putting fries in the bag and dodging grease fires, I took the day off from Wendy’s yesterday. Not for reflection. But, to trade like an unmedicated war analyst with insider vibes and zero credentials.

With $12k left in my account and a gut feeling powered by “caffeine” and global tension, I YOLO’d everything into SPY puts and VIX calls.

Why?

Because I read:
“Israel may strike as early as Sunday.”
Which came right after they said “imminent.”

Nobody announces an “imminent” attack and then politely delays it by several days to give their enemy time to stretch and hydrate.
This wasn’t strategy. This was “let’s confuse everyone and strike earlier.” There was also mixed signals from Israel, the White House.

So I acted.
SPY puts. VIX calls. All in. No stops. No logic. Just raw instinct and trauma.  

This morning?
Group chats were screaming “BUY CALLS. VIX IS DEAD. WE’RE BACK BABY.”
It felt like watching a room full of people high-five each other while the floor collapses beneath them.

So I held.
+70.8% for the day.

In fact, things are looking up.
The dream of opening a hedge fund is alive again.** I’ve already picked the name: “Imminent Alpha.”**
Strategy? Trade only off vibes, miscommunications, and global tension.

Still got a long road back to $353k.
But for now, I’ve got $21k, slightly less shame, and a Costco chicken riding shotgun.

Regards,
Tyler (yes, a regard)

Was down over 60% at one point, but held out and it paid off. About a 50% gain, or $7k for a couple hours. Had to average down to make it work.

1laej6k,2025-06-13,"NuScale (SMR): The nuclear plays that's actually not retarded

Listen up regards, I found something that might actually print harder than your wife’s boyfriend’s portfolio.

AI is literally melting our power grid. Every time you ask ChatGPT for feet pics, data centers burn more electricity than a small city. We’re on track for 80 gigawatts of data center demand by 2030 - that’s like adding 20 million homes to the grid. Microsoft, Google, Amazon. They’re all desperate for reliable power that doesn’t depend on whether the sun is shining or the wind is blowing.

Enter NuScale (SMR). These beautiful bastards are the ONLY company with Nuclear Regulatory Commission-approved small modular reactor designs in America. Not “planning to get approved” or “working on it” - actually approved and ready to build. While other nuclear startups are still playing with PowerPoint presentations, NuScale has real reactors being manufactured by Doosan in South Korea.

Here’s where it gets spicy. CEO John Hopkins isn’t some random suit - this guy is Vice Chair of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and serves on the National Petroleum Council. When you’re advising the Secretary of Energy and rubbing shoulders with every major industrial player in America, deals tend to happen. Hopkins has explicitly stated they have NDAs with 5 “tier-one hyperscalers.” That’s code for the biggest tech companies on Earth.

The stock broke out of a 2-year base and is showing every technical signal imaginable. Golden crosses on multiple timeframes, held $40 support through heavy selling, and here’s the kicker - the options chain was capped at $50 until yesterday (now it's $60). When market makers cap strikes that aggressively on a volatile stock, they’re telegraphing where it’s headed. They don’t want retail getting 10x leverage to $100.

The real tell? Free float is still under 50% after a massive rally. Over half the shares are locked up by insiders and institutions who aren’t selling at these levels. When a stock has rallied 40% and insiders still won’t take profits, they know something we don’t. The float is so tight that when news drops, this thing will gap up violently.

The setup is perfect. The government needs domestic energy production for national security. Big Tech needs baseload power for AI supremacy. The military wants SMRs for bases and forward operations. Every major trend points to nuclear, and SMR is the only approved player at the table. When the first hyperscaler deal announces, we’re looking at an instant revaluation to $60+. When multiple deals hit, $100 isn’t a meme.

Risk is maybe 20% downside if deals take longer than expected. Upside is 2-5x in the next 12 months. In this market, that’s about as asymmetric as it gets.

Not financial advice, I just think atoms are neat and my nuclear engineering degree is from YouTube University.

Positions attached.

They haven't produced anything yet and any attempt to be contracted to actually build has resulted in the client backing out due to rising costs. (Before the project even starts; IE Romania or Idaho) 

And, as the comment linked points out, they still need regulatory approval once they actually get a customer. 

Have you heard anything about actual customers? It looks like Google, Apple, etc. are going elsewhere... I bought it at 17 and sold it at 34, the risk is not profitable now.
When you see 100% in few weeks its better to sell Designs based on older tech are easier to get past regulators. Whether that's good or bad business-wise is a good question, since history is filled with examples where an inferior product brought first to market dominated the later more technically advanced entries. yeah you are right. The DD mentions nothing about customers. Because they really don't have any. My friend works for Nuscale. He's loving this run up on the stock. But this is vibe play. Downside risk is so large since the stock went crazy and they still don't have a customer My only nuclear stock is Cameco CCO from Canada. Sell the uranium.  If you're not bullish on nuclear as a whole, it might seem risky right now. It's a bet I'm willing to make however. Hard to make big money without big risk 🤝🏻 Google - Kairos and Elementl


Amazon - X-Energy, Energy Northwest (a group that'll likely contract it out), Talen Energy and Dominion Power (Partnered with Westinghouse for their reactors) 


Meta - Just buying existing nuclear power from Constellation Energy


Bill Gates - Terrapower


And then there's another company Holtec Internation which has (supposedly solid) plans to deploy two Hyundai sm reactors in Florida. 


There's plenty of competition out there.

1la3w8x,2025-06-13,"PSA: If you have massive put positions or calls on defense stocks, you might want to hedge overnight to lock in gains.
Lots of us have positions that may be massively ITM if the overnight moves hold. If you have futures enabled (RH has it) you can go long spy/ndx futures to hedge against the current move being an overreaction. Be careful if you only have spreads though. But if you have SPY puts that are 1% OTM as of market close, you’re ITM now. I usually try to hedge half my projected gains. For example, if a SPY put position would net you $600 per contract gains at -1.5% spy, you might buy one micro SP500 contract, as a 1% change gives you a $300 gain or loss. If it rebounds to flat, you’ve locked in half your profit. If it falls another 1%, you lose $300 on future but make $600 on SPY puts. 
Not financial advice, obviously you need to be able to do math, have the collateral for futures contracts, etc.

1l9xn6q,2025-06-12,"Apple delays Siri AI upgrade to Spring 2026
Apple Inc. has set an internal release target of spring 2026 for its delayed upgrade of Siri, marking a key step in its artificial intelligence turnaround effort. 

The company’s Siri team is aiming to bring the revamped voice assistant to market as part of an iOS 26.4 software update, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The long-promised changes will allow Siri to tap into consumers’ personal data and on-screen activities in order to better fulfill queries.

Apple’s “.4” updates — known as “E” on the company’s internal software development schedule — are typically released in March. That was the case with iOS 18.4 this year and iOS 17.4 in 2024. But an exact date hasn’t been set internally for the software, beyond a spring time frame, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work is private. 

Apple, in response to a request for comment, said it hasn’t announced exact timing for the new Siri features. It reiterated earlier statements that the upgrades are planned for the “coming year.”

The timeline could still shift depending on whether new snags emerge. If the next several weeks of development work proves promising, the company could consider giving a preview of the features when it launches the next iPhones in the fall, one of the people said, though no final decisions have been made.

The upgrade has been a long time coming. Apple originally introduced the next-generation Siri features at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June of last year. The idea was to modernize the voice assistant — first introduced in 2011 — which hasn’t kept pace with chatbots and other AI tools.

The technology in the works also includes a system called App Intents that allows Siri to more precisely control applications and in-app actions across Apple devices.

If the latest release timing sticks, Apple will have gone nearly two years between announcing the new Siri and delivering it to customers. It’s been an especially high-profile delay because the capabilities were part of the iPhone 16 marketing last year — despite the new Siri not being close to ready. 

Within Apple, the original goal was to have the Siri features ready in the fall of 2024, alongside the new iPhone. The target then shifted to spring 2025. The company had privately expected a rollout as part of iOS 18.4, before moving the target again to May with iOS 18.5. 
AAPL and being behind the ball on AI…name a better love story key context: 

- original marketing announced AI features for Fall 2024

- then iPhone 16 marketing hyped Siri AI for Spring 2025

since missing that, their AI team has seen significant reorganization Several lifetimes in modern software development. Not to mention in AI development which is going even faster.

By the time Siri has abilities on par with today’s best models, nobody will care because it’ll be ancient tech. AWS is at least making bank selling shovels Amazon and being behind on AI I'd rather they get it right and ""magical"". Apple occupies a different space than Google, and fairly or not, are held to a high interface bar. They can't very well just show Google AI Search and call that Apple AI.  

Figure out how to ground invocations of AI with private data securely. Figure out how to respond fast using local and Cloud models. Figure out how to describe an intent that spans across multiple apps, each of which could have MCP Servers they expose or something like that, so you can do magical things by combining apps. Nah, AWS is their true darling product. They're firmly a tech company that also operates in the retail industry Who even uses Siri in the first place? Hey Craig, when will AI be released?

NVDA, I think even with its incredible growth over the past two years, is a $250 stock on sale. They make the best hardware and GPUs for AI infrastructure, so I think they’ll pop over $200 soon.

PYPL, because Elon lost like 25% of his net worth doing political stuff, he will look for other avenues to get quick gains, I think he still owns quite a bit of PayPal, and in addition PayPal just scored a big partnership (I forget who with, I only read the headline and saw green %). PayPal is a super under priced stock from what I understand, it’s always beating expectations and has a solid credit system and good consumer trust. I use it a lot, and I like betting on companies that I use.

SNAP, because I think they have a mystery under the hood that they have not yet revealed. They are still hiring AI/Tech recruiters, which means either they are dumb, or they expect to do a lot of hiring in that space and are willing to compete for the talent. They could be like a Reddit type stock, where the value comes from the user data that can be harvested for AI purposes. Idk I think they’re worth way more than $8 a share, based on their data alone.

They are deep ITM puts!  I did it this way because I wanted to buy the shares, but I also wanted some income on the side to help with expenses and the like.  I have portfolio margin, so instead of buying 300 shares at $205 for $61500,  I sold these to collect the extra premium and put that premium into TBIL.  I fully intend to be assigned to these and buy the shares. Until that time, i'm getting 4.6% per year in dividends on the full $70000,  unless AMZN blows past $240, this beats out just buying the stock in terms of total return and offers some slight downside protection. Am I reading you sold out of the money puts for a year out? Why not calls if you wanted to speculate? That’s my point. You are earning dividends through the Treasuries you own and it has nothing to do with short puts you run.

1l8ti83,2025-06-11,"$TMC: Trumps Executive Order Makes Deep Sea Mining The Next Big Thing With 16 Trillion Dollars Worth Of Untapped Minerals
**TLDR:** Deep Sea Mining is rapidly becoming a major industry, tapping into an estimated $16–20 trillion in untouched minerals. Geopolitical pressures, particularly with China, and the need for critical rare earth minerals have pushed the administration to initiate entry into this sector. **As the industry now is transitioning from exploration to commercialization, investing in this sector in my opinion is equivalent to investing in the Texas Oil Company in 1902 and is a once in a generation 10-50× play or Flop depending on how Things pan out... $TMC Stock Currently has the first mover advantage.**

**Edit TLDR addressing Environmental Concerns in comment section:** These metals are essential—we're going to mine them one way or another. Harvesting them from deep-sea nodules is simply far less destructive than tearing apart forests, polluting rivers, or exploiting child labor on land. **The need is non-negotiable; choosing the cleaner, safer, and more humane/ethical source should be too.** Years of endless environmental red tape and political arguments put American innovation on hold while other countries raced ahead.

# A Market Worth Trillions Waiting to be Capitalized

Deep sea mining is a new industry **unlocking roughly $16–20 trillion worth of metals** that are still sitting untouched on the ocean floor. The first big prize sits in the Pacific: potato sized nodules scattered across the seafloor. Each nodule is packed with four easy‑to‑lift metals—**manganese, nickel, copper, and cobalt**—ingredients for everything from stainless steel and power cables to wind‑turbine parts and the latest battery chemistries. After the nodules, miners can chase crusts on undersea mountains loaded with rare earths and **titanium, sulfide mounds along mid‑ocean ridges rich in zinc and gold,** and thick beds of **phosphate** that are vital for fertilizer. Even a small slice of these deposits could reset global supply chains and tilt the strategic balance.

# Why This Matters Now More Than Ever?

For decades deep‑sea mining stayed stuck. The tools to dig four miles down did not exist, and a global deal called the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) said no one could mine until countries wrote the rules together. **The United States never signed that treaty, so U.S. firms were sidelined. On 24 of April, a new executive order signed by Trump flipped the script: it told American agencies to give out their own seabed permits and get moving.** With China controlling many land‑based metals, Washington now sees the ocean floor as the backup supply. **That switch—from “wait” to “go”—is what makes this moment urgent.**

# The Next Sector To Fly After AI and Quantum?

This sector just jumped from Exploration to initiation of Commercialization. The executive order threw open the doors, and the mining tech that engineers have been refining for a decade is finally cleared for action. **This setup for me feels exactly like the early days of AI or quantum Mania... For me, it's like buying into the Texas Oil boom back in 1902**: the ground floor, before drills hit pay dirt. With the tools tested, the permits coming, and demand for these metals only climbing, deep‑sea mining is starting its own gold‑rush moment...

# $TMC: First Mover Advantage

TMC (The Metals Company) has spent more than a decade quietly gearing up for this moment. Since 2011 the team has mapped the richest nodule fields in the Clarion‑Clipperton Zone, partnered with heavy‑hitters like Allseas to build a full‑scale collector ship, and filed mountains of environmental data. What held them back wasn’t technology—it was red tape. Until now they needed the International Seabed Authority (ISA) to finish its rulebook. On 29 of April, it filed the **first‑ever** U.S. applications for two exploration licences and a commercial recovery permit under the Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act. **NOAA formally logged the filings for a completeness check on May 30** and launched a 60‑day clock to decide whether the applications meet all baseline requirements before a full technical and environmental review begins. At this pace, if everything goes according to plan, TMC could be clearing nodules **flying a U.S. flag even before the ISA finishes arguing over global rules.**

Moreover, China is not as advanced technologically as The Metals Company. ""I would characterize China as being two to four years behind them in terms of their technology,"" said Alex Gilbert of the Payne Institute, Colorado School of Mines.

# Edit: Addressing Environmental Concerns in the comment section

TMC isn’t rushing in blind. Over the last ten years they’ve run 22 research trips, grabbed loads of data, and put most of it online for anyone to check. In a 2022 test, the stirred-up mud hugged the seafloor and settled fast. A peer-reviewed study says metals from these seabed rocks could **cut the carbon footprint by about half compared with digging on land. There’s no blasting, no giant waste pond, and no acid runoff because the rocks come up loose.**

Plus, the nodule plains they’re working on sit **four miles down in what scientists call an “abyssal desert.”** It’s cold, dark, and food-poor, so biomass is tiny—far less life per square meter than on a coral reef or even a coastal seafloor. **That means less habitat disruption per ton of metal compared with ripping up tropical rain forests or river valleys on land.**

**Land mining often tears down forests, drains rivers, and leaves huge tailings piles that can leak for decades.** It also pumps out far more CO₂ because trucks, explosives, and smelters run nonstop. Meanwhile, big land-based **miners—especially nickel and cobalt producers in Indonesia and companies that buy cobalt from small mines in central Africa—have been pressuring their governments and the ISA to slow ocean mining since cheaper seabed metals would slice into their profits. Some of those same land mines have been tied to harsh, unsafe conditions and even child labor. If deep-sea metals can replace minerals dug by kids in dangerous pits, cut carbon by half, avoid wrecking forests, and disturb a sparsely populated deep-sea plain instead of a jungle, that sounds like a clear win to me.**

Endless “green tape,” court fights, and stop-sign politics in the last administration pushed U.S. projects years behind. While Washington argued over climate talking points and the Green-New-Deal crowd blocked permits on land **and** sea, other countries kept drilling, digging, and patenting the gear we now need. **If we keep treating every new resource project like it’s the end of the world, we’ll hand the entire supply chain to China—again.** The new executive order finally cuts through that clutter, but only if we ignore the same old scare tactics and get moving.

What are your thoughts regards? That’s my read and might be totally wrong: deep‑sea mining is about to rewrite the playbook for critical minerals and for me looks like a once in a generation 10-50×‑upside play that could lock in U.S. leadership on critical minerals Or a complete flop and could crash and burn lol.

Just some of the trades I don't get what the percentage listed on the Robinhood **Realized profit/loss** page actually means. Because it's often so off. Like here it says 12% which is obviously wrong as his YTD chart shows over 3k%.

I've seen other posts with crazy 100k-500k gains with something like 0.6% on the realized profit/loss chart, but obviously that's incorrect as the all time chart showed a completely different story.

Someone pls explain. If you read, it says the P&L was for options. The realized P&L is calculated against capital deployed. Since he made all this money with options, while his total account balance is up 3k% based on the $350 he started with, his returns from redeployment of his WINNINGS in New trades, in totality, resulted in a realized profit of ~12% on the capital he deployed. It's not his total profit, it's his profit on options. The percentage does not look at overall account capital in that case, only at Options Deployed Capital (not official terminology just illustrating a point).

If he adds money and then puts it all on stocks and loses 50%, the 12% YTD gain would still be there as it's only looking at the options activity. A green year on WSB?

I wasn’t sure about this, so I only invested a small amount around $1500. Print or lose, well it's printing good so far. Wish I could've invested more. So far, I’ve made around $10K with TSLA calls. 
If it was me I'll take the profit no matter what amount, it's had a crazy run up after dropping 22% but it's Tesla so who knows it can reach 350 Yup it's Tesla, the worse it does, the higher the stock goes (until it crashes, but good luck timing that) I timed the last crash and then didn't even sell my puts Dude same lol, I was so convinced the bad fundamentals and drops in sales would just make it keep going down... my portfolio literally went from -20% or so to a peak of +40% (just for a few minutes when it tanked to 272) and I didn't sell. That's by far my biggest regret in trading so far... but timing the bottom/top is of course very difficult anyway

At least I sold 1 put when it was at 285 or so. What lmao he’s going to get theta fucked on any flat movement hold it. your entry is so low. you got no risk update us please

Ride out or good enough to sell ? 

I really don't understand who's buying Tesla stock right now. Cause there sure ain't anyone out there buying his cars. And now he's pissed off both left and right leaning people. Where's the customer base coming from? I don't get it He cried about pork and then went back for it. Don’t forget to wipe the corners of your mouth Lots of big orgs and funds have tons of money tied up in Tesla stock, but I think it’s speculators who have seen the stock do wild things and just expect it to. That will only stop when the company becomes obviously headed for immediate disaster which, despite how bad things are for Tesla isn’t true yet. They still could be successful with the FSD (not likely) or the corporate batteries (decently likely). It wouldn’t really be worth the price for either of those but the stock divorced reality years ago and only sees it every other weekend to pick the kids up. Elon knows when to get on his knees and start sucking an orange cock finally off his meds and everything is back on schedule! So now Elon is doing his own pump & dumps, just like Trump. Buying cheaper puts 🚀 Highly regarded retail and hedge funds buy 0DE calls which forces the market-makers to buy. BuTT hE WaS THe REaL PreSIDenT🤤

1l7wetd,2025-06-10,"Should you buy the dip? I analyzed all S&P 500 companies to find what happens if we only invest in companies undergoing drawdowns.
To test, I picked all the companies in the S&P 500 list as of 2015. The backtest is simple— If a company drops by 50%, we invest $100 in that company and then hold.

I immediately ran into an issue. Out of the 502 companies on the list, 262 companies experienced a drawdown of more than 50% over the last 10 years. If you end up investing in all of them, your average return will be comparable to the index since you are holding half the index. *(Average return of 114% for the drawdown portfolio vs. 123% for the S&P 500).*

**Where it gets interesting is when we increase the drawdown cutoffs.**

# Drawdown cutoff — 75%

* Number of stocks: 91
* Total amount of investment: $9,500
* Drawdown portfolio final value (June’25): $23,903 **(151% return)**
* Comparable S&P 500 index: $20,467 **(115% return)**
* Alpha — 36%
* Median return: 68.4%

# Best and worst performers

As you would expect, investing in companies that had significant drawdowns would be highly volatile. After all, a stock that went down 90% can again go down another 90%!

Buy and hold seems to be the best strategy, as there would be many multi-baggers..

Its incredible that i am losing for 4 fuckin consecutive months. Uuhhh... So i was not greedy at all when i began this life sucking mistake. I thought ı can make %10 profit a day with trading SPY and high volume stocks especially pennies. First month was OK, But i wasnt aware that the market is always ready and greedy enough to take all of my money. Every frickin day i lost and lost. The last two month is truly horrendous. I am broke but my heart is totally destroyed. Right now i am still have the fuckin HOPE and still BELIEVE i can make money... BUT if you ask DOES IT WORTH ? No... YET i am still alive and breathing. I am GRATEFUL. And Stupid !
I was not greedy, just wanted 10% gains per day… Bro thought he could “make 10% profit a day”

That’s certified grade A retardation.

A 10% return per trading day, compounded, works out to be a 26,910,000,000% annual return.

26.9 billion percent for those who can’t read good.

Give this guy a helmet and make sure he no longer has access to the internet. Think about it this way: if you could consistently pin down 10% gains *per year*, you could be a top-tier fund manager with billions of dollars in assets under management 


At 10% *per day*, your money would double roughly every 7 trading days. In 2 months your 14k would be somewhere in the ballpark of $1m.

Don't trick yourself into thinking this is anything other than a casino and we're all just hoping we can make our big score before our money runs out https://preview.redd.it/ofkmjhxmqy5f1.jpeg?width=1320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c999f8d339e6e1569bd39f74ceb71ac232488b6c damn bro just inverse yourself then you'd win for 4 consecutive months !!! OP wasting his time for 10% per day. OP should be shooting for 10% per hour to make back his losses by end of tomorrow If you returned 10% per day for all 251 trading days in 2025, you would have over 300 trillion dollars from your 14k portfolio which is 3x the world economy.  Perhaps this is a bit too much. It’s beyond “too much”, motherfucker. You would end up with $244k after 30 days That was what stuck out to me. buffett ain't sh@t compare to that

1l736uz,2025-06-09,"Why Sweetgreen Is Undervalued
So here’s my honest take on why I think Sweetgreen is undervalued compared to where it’s heading in the future. For some context, I’ve been slowly accumulating shares since February 21st, 2023, with my first buy being 106 shares at $9.38. I currently hold 3,194.055 shares at an average cost of $23.66—which is about $9.61 higher than where the stock is trading today.

Anyway, here’s what I think is going right for Sweetgreen right now, and what’s not going so great:


What’s Going Well

1. Rewards Program Rolling Out Nicely
They just launched a new rewards program that gives 10 points for every $1 spent—and they’re signing up 20,000 new members a week. This is huge because it’ll let them target offers by customer segment and even individually, which is something that’s worked really well for other fast-casual chains to drive better same-store sales and revenue growth.

2. Infinite Kitchen Expansion = Big Efficiency Gains
They’re on track to open 40 new stores this year, and at least 20 of those will be the new Infinite Kitchen format. Plus, they’ll be opening their first Infinite Kitchen with a drive-thru, which could be a big deal down the road—drive-thrus are super competitive but also super profitable if you do them right.

The Infinite Kitchen is already showing big improvements—like around 700 basis points in margin boost mostly from labor savings, plus a potential 100 basis point COGS improvement. That’s at least 7 percentage points from labor and 1 point from COGS compared to similar stores without the tech.

The first Infinite Kitchen store hit a 26% restaurant-level margin in its first full month—that’s way better than the 20.4% average across the chain at the time. Less staff, more accuracy, faster service. Huge win.

3. Right Target Customer
Millennials and Gen Z are their core customer base—which is perfect because these groups really care about health, sustainability, transparency… everything Sweetgreen leans into. Together they make up like 43% of the U.S. population. Long-term this is the group you want.

4. Revenue Still Growing Despite Everything
Even with all the macro headwinds, fires in California (where a lot of their stores are), reduced marketing, and seasonal menu pullbacks, they’re still growing revenue at over 15% year-over-year. That’s not bad considering everything going on.


Valuation is Dirt Cheap Compared to Peers…

Here’s the kicker no one seems to be talking about—Sweetgreen is dirt cheap compared to the comps.

Right now they trade at a 2.1x EV/FY 2025 revenue multiple. That’s less than half of Chipotle’s valuation, and below Cava and even McDonald’s—who’s also struggling to grow same-store sales right now.

Their guidance says they’ll end FY 2025 with 286 stores (adding 40 this year), which puts their valuation at around $5.5 million EV per store. Chipotle is sitting at $16.2 million EV per store (with over 4,000 stores expected by year-end).

So yeah—Sweetgreen stores are underperforming right now. But the top-line pressure is mostly macro-related (stuff that should pass) and the margin squeeze should ease as they roll out more Infinite Kitchens.

For long-term investors willing to wait this out, this is a super cheap stock on both a revenue and per-store basis.


What’s Not Going So Well

1. Same-Store Sales Took a Hit
Q1 2025 was rough—same-store sales dropped 3.1%, which was the first negative comp since their IPO in 2021. People are spending less on discretionary stuff, and the fast-casual space is super competitive right now.

But I honestly think this is a temporary issue—they’re in a weird transition period with the loyalty program, there were the California wildfires, and they pulled back seasonal menu items. My guess is by the back half of the year, comps will be back on track.

2. Portion Size Complaints = Real Problem
This one is more anecdotal but I’ve spent some time (probably way too much time) digging through social media and reviews—and there’s a common theme: people think portions are small for the price they’re paying. Price per calorie is way worse than competitors and that’s something they really need to fix if they want loyal, repeat customers.

The Infinite Kitchen should help with this since everything is measured perfectly—but honestly I’m surprised these places don’t have like portioning spoons or scales for proteins to make sure staff isn’t shorting people. Seems like such an easy win.

3. Can They Get Loyalty Members to Come Back More Often?
20,000 new signups a week is great—but if those people don’t come back more often, it won’t matter. They need to find a way to get those new members hooked and visiting more frequently. If they do, same-store sales could pop big time.


Why I’m Still Super Bullish

Look, despite all this, I think Sweetgreen has a shot to 10x in the next 5–10 years, which would get them to an $18–20 billion market cap. That’s not crazy when you look at Chipotle sitting at $70B and Cava at $10B.

Plus, they’ve got tons of optionality left—new menu stuff, handheld items, healthy fountain drinks like kombucha (super high margin). This is a company going through a rough patch, but I think they’ll come out the other side way stronger.


Disclosure:
I’m long ~3,100 shares plus October 2024 call options.

Their salads cost more than their shares. Something’s wrong here. Dude is down 30k and is like “trust me bro, this salad company call won’t go tits up” Are you trying to convince yourself? You’re first point in the going well column is their rewards program? PUTS it is Trying to get others to carry his heavy bags. Sweet green sells salads for $20 You sound like you invested for a long term, but company's margins and slow revenue growth does not support the idea of long term investing.

1l6dfob,2025-06-08,"Powell praying AI paying, boomers buying  and you wanna short this
Honestly I still don’t get why people are so aggressively bearish. Like yeah, consumer data looks weak, retail earnings are trash, housing is soft  cool we get it. That’s been true for months  But have you actually looked at what moves the market right now?  


Big tech is absolutely ripping  AI isn’t some future fantasy  it’s real spend, real revenue, real margins. Nvda adds $300B in a week, Msft printing, Goog melting up  even Apple finally waking up. That’s literally half the index. And people think the S&P’s just gonna collapse? Lmao  


Every week I see the same doom porn  credit cracks, recession lurking, “this time it’s different”  and yet price action doesn’t care. You know why? Because when stuff does start breaking, the Fed eases. They don’t want a crash heading into an election year. They’ll pivot the second things get messy  
And the fear over rising delinquencies… yeah no kidding. What did you think would happen after the fastest hiking cycle in 40 years? Obviously credit gets tight. But this isn’t 2008. Unemployment is still under 4%, corporate balance sheets are solid, and the system isn’t imploding Chill  


The market’s not pricing in perfection. It’s pricing in “slightly less bad” and “maybe we get cuts”. Yields are easing, buybacks are rolling, and there’s no alternative that yields 30% YTD like $Qqq. Money has to go somewhere  


Truth is, most of you are still traumatized from 2022. You don’t trust green candles. You assume every rip is a bull trap. But markets don’t crash when everyone’s scared. They crash when everyone’s dancing on tables. Right now? Everyone’s still hiding in T-bills and buying puts  
You really think the S&P dumps while Apple is buying back stock like it’s a religion and boomers are auto-buying every paycheck? Come on  


And don’t even get me started on the Fed Powell’s out here praying the soft landing meme becomes real. They’re not raising again. They’re literally looking for a reason to cut. Give them one more bad payroll print and they’ll have the press release ready  
But sure, let me go sell all my longs and load puts because Starbucks missed same-store sales by 1.2%. Brilliant.  
This market isn’t euphoric  it’s hated. And that’s exactly why it keeps grinding higher  
Still long. Still buying dips. Still not fighting the tape
This is my top signal I don't get it, everything is shit and the market it self is behaving illogically why the bearishness? Look at the comments here. Everyone's still bearish so calls it is. I don’t get why my doctor says I should lay off the greasy foods. Sure I have chest pains, I’m out of breath easily, and my blood pressure is over 200, but have you noticed how tasty all the fried foods are? Why all the negativity on my diet, doc? Sorry, was that calls or puts then? OP should go back and re-read their first sentence, this time reading it slowly and deliberately.

1l628m7,2025-06-08,"why GOOGL (Alphabet) is a great buy right now
With WWDC and the Robotaxi event next week, I'd like to discuss Google and its parent company Alphabet, they have been in trouble for a while now regarding some bullshit anti-trust cases, and I want to tell you why its pure FUD.  Google has really caught up with the rest of the Mag 7 giants in their AI advancements if you haven't noticed.  They have been doing AI machine learning since 2001.  Bard was unimpressive, but that was only little over a year ago.  The speed at which they have been making new advancements is almost hard to track (even across other LLM's).

Have you tried Gemini?  VEO 3 costs 250/m and people are loving it. (the rev. from that will be great as well) and the new AI mode for search seems to finally have been embraced and I think they can actually leverage AI to better serve people the right business ads / referrals.  ***Either way they are monetizing AI***\*...\*

Regarding all the FUD, I dont believe the judge can make them sell chrome, EU case is just stupid, the whole thing is about them having monopoly on search and ads...  well there is Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Perplexity, Meta / Instagram business Ads, etc..  they have no monopoly anymore if there was one...

I dont believe the cases will result in anything materially bad for the stock but nobody can be sure, so that is why I want to dig into the Fundmental and Technical Analysis.

# ----------- Fundamentals -----------

Alphabet is a massive conglomerate with many subsidiaries.  Lets talk about how they are competing and kicking ass in so many different industries.

\-

**AI:**  

*VEO 3, AI Mode, Gemini, DeepMind* \- Competing with GPT pro, Microsoft, etc.  (note VEO 3 is still the only model that does text to video PLUS audio.  I think they leveraged youtube for it.

**Data Centers / Internet Provider:**

When you buy GOOGL you are buying the entirety of Alphabets investments.  And they are so well positioned from a fundamental and financial perspective as seen in this group of charts.  They make double nearly double the revenue of Nvidia...

[Google makes more revenue than the rest of the Mag 7, nearly double Nvidia's earnings!  the only exception of Apple which could be in jeopardy too if they dont continue to innovate.](https://preview.redd.it/i61ok3bywl5f1.png?width=1183&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab383da02f61b9d5fdc7bb71ce2bde6c7d453ac2)

\-

Yet oddly, Google has the lowest P/E (price to earnings) ratio than the rest of the Mag 7!  That seems off if you ask me.  I believe they can take plenty of market share back in the future based on these 2 figures.

# -------- Technical Analysis --------

so now lets look at the Chart!  Because Price Action Speaks more than anything else...

I like to use Multiple Timeframes for analysis so here I have the 4 hour, daily, and weekly charts.

I know there are a lot of lines and colors, dont be scared.  The indicators I use are patterns combined with price action, fib levels, TTM squeeze, RSI and some other factors such as price gaps.

\- With RSI, above/below the 50 line tells you if momentum is bullish or bearish.  All the higher timeframes are above that 50 line indicating a potential bullish reversal.

\- With TTM it makes it easier to visualize these momentum shifts.  Right now my focus is on that Weekly chart on the bottom right - higher time frames are usually more important and it appears to be on the verge of a weekly breakout.  Now with a stock like this it could take months to reach that earnings Gap and make a new all time high.  When or If this happens depends on a lot of factors, but I am only focusing on the chart.

\- The Fibonacci Retracements I mostly use for the 50% line to determine if the price has had a change of trend.  Right now the price is attempting a breakout above this retracement and if it can break over 175 then there is plenty of room up.

\- Ive also illustrated some patterns and concepts on the chart.  Inverted Head and Shoulders, Trendline Break, Higher Highs and Higher Lows, potentially an even larger inverted H&S on the daily chart to the top right.

https://preview.redd.it/d2fprue33m5f1.jpg?width=3676&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77f0a1e390e7b81ec6f893f6f38220ffc3fde21f

Ok so what does this technical analysis mumbo jumbo mean?  Its hard to say because of Trump, Tarrifs, Deals, Interest Rates, Bonds, Geopolitics, the fact that the market has already just about reached all time highs and this is lagging...  it is concerning.  It could also just be setting up for a massive (bearish) head and shoulders as you might notice on the bottom right weekly chart.

But with WWDC, RoboTaxi, and several trump deals supposedly taking place next week, we could be setup for some bullish continuation if these tech events impress.  Either way, Long Term I believe Google / Alphabet stock will get back to 200.

From a technical and fundamental perspective they are in great shape.  I would even bet that if the market pulls back, that institutions may rotate their Mag 7 holdings into the laggards such as this and Amazon.

While they are aggressively competing with so many different companies and industries, their earnings are expected to continue to grow and as you saw earlier, they earn double what Nvidia earns... Pelosi still has calls, and lets face it, you still use some kind of google product in your life whether its youtube, your android based phone, ai / gemini research, waymo, etc...  I believe Google is well positioned to be a winner this year in AI and many of its subsidiary company products.

\--------------

# TLDR:

**Alphabet is a great Bet !**

I currently am selling put credit spreads on GOOGL, and have several 180 calls for 7/18 that I only plan to hold through next week before I re-enter as there is going to be a lot going on next week for the markets.  Their earnings are on 7/22 I believe, so August may be a better strike date.  Shares or LEAPS (calls dated atleast for 2026) are also a good idea IMO, you can sell calls against them to hedge when there are large spikes.

**Anyway, I am highly regarded** ***and this is not financial advice,*** but I am very bullish on Google long term.  Its not an easy one to trade if you like short dated options, you need patience, but the chart, the p/e ratios, the incredible amount of subsidiaries competing with more than other Mag 7 companies makes this thing a highly undervalued growth & value stock.

*Price Target short term - 180*

*Price Target long term - 200+*

1l5ljx1,2025-06-07,"$KSS - 24k USD Call Option YOLO / 10$ strike July 18th
Hello degens, after securing 6k profit from AMC calls and DUOL puts I am now doing a YOLO on $KSS. Pray for me gang because I really want to quit my job 🥀

Position: 650 calls for 10$ strike July 18th.

Some points as to my YOLO:

- Net loss narrowed in latest quarter vs. prior
- Closed fulfillment center + store rationalization cutting operating costs
- ~$1.5B liquidity; manageable debt maturities in next 12-18 months
- Quarterly dividend $0.125/share, yield ~5.7% at current $8.75 price
- Ex-dividend date is June 11; last day to buy and qualify is June 10
- ~54% of float sold negatively; borrow fee doubled to 20% in one week
- Added to NYSE Threshold Securities List June 4 — sustained fails to deliver
- Only missing piece: permanent CEO appointment
- Possible weekly chart breakout if price closes above ~$9.30 with volume

Godspeed! 🤝
i heard someone say they will short squeeze soon, 50% short float You said the forbidden word and got smacked with nuts sir July... 2025?

Six weeks. In summer. Before earnings. Before Back to School.

Love the play, the timing makes me think maybe take the first pop you see green on and roll a little longer.

But good luck friend. Squeeze I have 400 shares of this PoS. 

Lessgoo Wow, I'm surprised you only paid $217 in commission to open the position. Squeeze deez nuts you fuckin nerd.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.* I don't know if you're being ironic, but, those are the fees at IBKR Pro - 0.65$ per contract and then taxes on top, so, actually a bit more than 217$ 😅 Wow. I seriously did not expect that.

Ibkr has a tiered plan, where you should get lower fees at the volume you're playing at, but check their website to see if it makes sense. You can request the change from account settings.

Either way, have a look at the preview button prior to submitting the order. They give you a range for commissions and your margin impact. It definitely made me reconsider trades.

I've looked at the IV for Kohl's and it's crazy, sitting at 66%. Even TQQQ (leverage ETF) sits at 50%.

From serving the tendies to ordering them 😎
Couldn’t do this again if I tried.

Robinhood screwed me yesterday,
Was up $3k but couldn’t exit position because I would have been labeled a day trader. LABEL ME Why is there gain on my loss app? Same thing happens to me all the time, so now I just lower my risk by selling an option to create a spread. Different strike prices don’t count as a day trade.

For example today:

12:03pm
Buy: SPY $599 Put 6/9 x10 @ 2.19 

12:06pm
Sell: SPY $598 Put 6/9 x10 @ 2.22

Initial capital in trade: $2200

Realized profit after spread created: $30

Current capital at risk: $0

Currently up about $400 unrealised You should have sold and took profits, you can always email Robinhood to removed the day trader flag one time. Also switching to a cash account lets you day trade unlimited as long as you’re using settled funds. Haha I paid for Robinhood gold for the 4% interest rate for uninvested cash when… my account was much larger and it actually mattered.

The extra is just margin, however if you’re buying straight options they don’t really give you any margin to work with.

Actual account value \~$8k

Cash  in account at screenshot \~$7k

RH gold margin offered \~$14k

I’m gonna leave this pic here to show the dangers of me trading on margin

I turned a 1m paper account to -5m in an hour because I didn't know how the margin worked. There’s a reason I didn’t post my YTD. It goes up sometimes so it can go down more! I don't get it, can you explain what you're doing here?

1l4dy03,2025-06-05,"$72.7K Profit on TSLA Puts Today Because Elon Can’t Help Himself and TSLA Bulls are in a Cult
Initiated TSLA July 18th 280 Puts on Tuesday because I think the Austin Robotaxi reveal would be a dud.  Waymo is much further along in autonomy.  The Austin Robotaxi reveal is basically a carefully curated theatrical attempt at autonomy.  It’s Level 2 and nowhere close to Level 3 or 4 autonomy.

AMZN also announced today they’re going to use robots to help with packaging/delivering.  There goes the TSLA robotics premium.  

Little did I know Elon would go full tilt today and bite the most consequential Hand that feeds, 🥭.

To all the delusional TSLA Bulls aka CULT FOLLOWERS:  

You deserve every bit of this pain and all that is yet to come.  

Play stupid games.  Win stupid prizes.




It's hilarious that they're actively throwing more money into the well trying to keep the price from plummeting.  More for me! I'm so jealous. I took a 6k profit and left 20k on the table. Paper hands Volume is light after hours.  Doesn't take much to move the price.  Once tomorrow morning kicks in, we'll see where the numbers are and the directionality and see if the put options will continue to print. All i'm seeing are the people that made money on TSLA today , like no one lost on TSLA haha If we bounce tomorrow I’m diving in with some 220 puts expiring in September or October.

I might add more on a bounce. Hope you sold some and took profit.  Looks like a fake war to drop the price of Tesla and fake makeup tomorrow before market open to pump. I lost with puts in advance of the last earnings call. Bailed at an 80% loss and used what was left to buy TSLZ which is still down like 40% from where I bought it.

*35x TSLA Jul18'25 300 Put*

Alright regards, here's why there's still plenty of juice left in this TSLA correction.

1) Robotaxi release is gonna be a total bust/sell-the-news. Nobody trusts FSD, nobody would hop in a Tesla when they could easily get a Waymo that has been tested for multiple years. Press is going to be watching like a hawk for any mishaps/bugs, which there will be. This is definitely not going to be what investors were hoping for.  
  
2) Robotaxi release is high-risk, expect to see investors close positions leading up to the event. Cue in any number of videos showing FSD mowing down pedestrians or showing how bad a camera-only system is. I wouldn't want to risk a large position going into this. This whole robotaxi venture was dead the moment Enron refused to put LiDAR on the cars.  
  
3) There was hype surrounding Enron's departure from the administration. Would've taken a goddamn miracle but honestly if he left the administration quietly, making sure not to burn any bridges, maybe he could save the brand a bit while still getting the benefits of being close to the admin. Except now he's getting in brawls with the administration and trashing their bill. He's burning all the bridges.

4) Declining sales and other stuff that doesn't actually affect the stock price at all.

5) CPI next week, likely to actually start showing the effects of tariffs.

Started my account this year and I'm up about $96k (img attached for proof) so combine that fact with this being a regarded TSLA play, I'm fully ready to lose all this shit.
Jeez... Tesla FSD kills one granny and everyone gets all negative.

Alright losers hear me out.

Your boy hit $PLTR big, and sized up with $NET now.

I work with Cloudflare every day, and IMO Wall Street is sleeping on what this company is about to pull off.

Everyone’s busy throwing money at $NVDA and $PLTR, but $NET is perfectly positioned to be one of the biggest beneficiaries in the AI boom and no one is pricing it in.

Here’s why:

* Cloudflare isn’t just a CDN or DDoS shield — it’s becoming the backbone of the internet
* They’re rolling out serverless compute (Workers), AI inference at the edge, and building a network that can scale globally faster and cheaper than the cloud giants.
* AI workloads need fast, secure, distributed infra — exactly what Cloudflare specializes in.
* Partnerships with OpenAI, Hugging Face, NVIDIA, etc., are flying under the radar.

$NET has been quietly building a moat, and when the market wakes up, it’s going to rip faces off.

**PS: I tried to post this 28 days ago, mods deleted it, their loss, your boy is up bigly**

Positions: $170k+ in $NET, up $70k in the last 4 weeks

1l3g733,2025-06-04,"SPY vs SPX
So I used to trade SPY every day. Nice liquidity, cheap contracts, vibes were good. Until tax season hit me like a margin call and I realized half my gains were going to the government. Cool. Love that.

Then I found SPX. Big brother version. Ten times the size. Zero assignment risk. And Uncle Sam only takes 23 percent thanks to that sweet 6040 rule. If you don’t know what that is, congrats, you’re about to save a fat chunk on taxes.

SPY is an ETF. Every gain is short-term capital gains. SPX is an index. It’s cash-settled. The IRS treats 60 percent of your gains as long-term even if you sell five minutes later. That means if you’re trading SPX and making money, you’re keeping a lot more of it. It adds up fast.

Also, no risk of early assignment. No waking up to some random shares you didn’t ask for. SPX options are European style and cash-settled, which means it just gives you money or takes your money. No shares. No drama.

Now if you trade straddles or spreads like I do, SPX just moves cleaner. SPY gets wrecked on sideways chop. SPX holds value better and doesn’t collapse like a dying meme coin when nothing happens.

Only downside? SPX contracts are pricey. Like 2000 bucks versus 200 for SPY. But the thing is, one SPX contract moves like 10 spy contracts. You don’t need to size up like a degenerate. One good play and it prints, (or takes your soul). 

SPX gang. Less tax. Cleaner trades. Fewer headaches.

So which do you prefer and why? 

If you’re not profitable, please ignore.
I like SPX more because big price number activate monkey brain I only daytrade SPX options. 10 2DTE per trade and I sell before close. 2DTE means theta fucks you a bit less during the day, but a good swing can put you ITM for some big gains. I look for OTM contracts around $10 each, so about 10k per buy. Trailing stop on bid of $1 to limit max loss to around $1200 due to spread. I usually take profit around $2k-$3k.

I've made around 20k in May and didn't trade the last week. 

I love SPX options. I can’t even make money on spy and you expect me to trade spx??!! Hell no i do XSP coz it's just like SPX but 10x cheaper Spx. I can trade pre market and in the last 15 min. No auto close position or bullshit good luck with the wide spread. SPX 🔥 a lot less noise but a hell of a lot bigger gains- I personally keep my SPX strategy very simple I only go for potential big plays- catalyst, big tech earnings, CPI etc, even with those pricey contracts if you have a great set up and even go a bit out the money, this index can swing so much intraday that it’s possible for a 20-50 point movement making your contract a 5-10x play 🔥 but of course with all great gains come great losses, better not dare touch SPX if you don’t study her properly cause that bitch bites and she might poison ya 😉 I prefer trading SPX in  retirement account so I don't have to worry about taxes at all. You can usually get a fill around the midpoint, maybe a few cents toward the ask. Just don’t do market orders. BESSSSSST FREAKING THING ABOUT IT!

1l3akkw,2025-06-04,"UNH easiest play of the year
Before i get into why it is an obvious answer, lets get into why it is not a bad play.

1. As investors deal with the volatility of the changing global trade landscape, they will be looking to reallocate their investments into cashflow positive sectors that are not affected by the trade war. Insurance is a give me. 

2. The Medical insurance market overall is expected to continue growing through the midterm future, my favorite kind of future, with a 6% CAGR. I'm going to be adding a lot of ""up and to the right"" pictures for you regards.

3. As interest rates remain elevated, high growth, high multiple, low ROIC stocks will remain unattractive. This stock and industry has historically been a defensive play due to its inelasticity. 

  
Okay now lets get to the meat and potatoes. First off, I could be somewhat early we have seen the stock trade flat for the last 2 weeks around $302 a share. This is a good sign of resistance towards the bottom after an incredible 50% dip. The question is, how long will this sideways trading continue? So keep that in mind before you decide to follow me on my quest. Remember, in the stock market you can have only one priority. You can either be right, or you can make money. 

  
Im not a master of the crayon drawing but looking at our technicals, the stock is clearly over sold. In the 3 month view, RSI is oversold and MACD just crossed over.  Volume is very low and historically this stock made quick recoveries. Without knowing the underlying name, I would buy the stock.

Just a few quick stand alone financials as well as compared to its competitors. 

Although there have been increased operating costs all 3 statements remain strong. Good operating income on the income statement and 20.1B of free cash flow. Incredible.

Now let's begin our forward looking DD. We will begin by starting to look at the past. See the graph below? This is UNH during Stephen J. Hemsley's first reign as CEO from 2006 to the end of 2017.

He is a great strategic thinker and has already touched on the future focus for UNH [Back As UnitedHealth Group CEO, Hemsley Says Issues Can Be Resolved](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2025/05/13/back-as-unitedhealth-ceo-hemsley-says-issues-within-capacity-to-resolve/)

 Now, the elephant in the room i wont take much steam away from u/chrislink73 in his post [UNH vs DOJ and the factors surrounding the Judge's future decision : r/ValueInvesting](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1kpkwod/unh_vs_doj_and_the_factors_surrounding_the_judges/) This is America. The good old US of A. The probability that this corporation will be found guilty in my opinion is very low, just look at the recent trial for Boeing. What will most likely happen is a partial dismissal and UNH will pay out a few billion dollars which will also play out over several years. No biggie. Certainly no cause for us regards in 2025 as look to print tendies. 

TL/DR:

Good financials, over sold, new CEO in the reigns that will refocus the company, and the judicial system will disappoint the American people once again. 

Positions: 

Just got into it as I finished typing this post.

Bought 4 $350 12/19/25 OTM Call options at $20.65. I plan to sell with a VOL spike right before their late July Earnings release date. By then the stock should have recovered some and i can get out with an acceptable % gain. Targeting 40% gain for my exit, but then again i am greedy and I say that now. Good luck everyone!

But I’m dealing with it 🤑 Yep. Dividend is super safe as well, and growing quick.

They screwed me over when I was insured by them through MegaCorp.  I would never do business with them. 

I suspect that they are Taco approved, and will skate on any consequences. I hold there stock in my HSA account. The insider buying is also from new board members who are required to own X amount of stock per their 10k Their profit margin is 5 percent and boomers are about to get a whole lot sicker.

**INITIAL POSITION:** Bought 200 shares today @ 39.39 (I liked the number). Will buy more incrementally until I've deployed $50k into it and thats my cutoff for this ticker. I don't go super heavy on stuff like this (\*\*\*screenshot added in comments\*\*\*).

Yes I am talking about the thing you have in the junk drawer:

https://preview.redd.it/kdcjtnod8x4f1.jpg?width=1512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81a635c49f4c524daeb979a6c8869f104b262ad9

I am a senior level IC at a FAANG and deal with AI regularly and I only buy stocks in things I deal with and understand.

I looked into this when my wife came home with the wrong type of thumb drive for her stupid Macbook (a Sandisk that requires a USB - thank you Apple for removing those fucking ports on everything). Was curious if this was a company I could short and then learned what they were doing. Now I think this is a sleeper pick that nobody's really paying attention to.

**Product deep dive:**

* NVIDIA certified Sandisk’s Gen5 eSSDs for datacenter use. Certification means they're officially in the vendor chain for AI servers.
* Additionally, they've also built something called High Bandwidth Flash (HBF) which is a new memory architecture built for massive memory capacity and throughput (important for AI). Nobody else is making this and it's developed in-house (one of the main reasons I bought).
* Sandisk is shipping one of the most power-efficient flash technologies available right now, BiCS8.
* Cloud sales—12% of Sandisk’s total output went to AWS/GCP/Azure this quarter, up from 8% a year ago. My employer is one of these and our AI spend is essentially a blank check. It's kind of an arms race right now.
* AI spend isn't going to stop. I work in a part of a FAANG where we're seeing complete transformation plans to overhaul our customer-facing service into an AI-heavy experience. Yes a lot of companies are bleeding money on this but a lot aren't. I see the sales numbers and the internal productivity boost we've gotten is insane.

**Brand shift:**

Yes they do still make consumer stuff. But IGAF about thumb drives sold at Walmart. What they are building gives them a seat at the table for large AI-related deals.

**Earnings TLDR:**

* Revenue: $1.7B
* Adjusted free cash flow: $220M
* Cash on hand: $1.5B
* Forecast: demand strengthening through year-end
* Gross margin took a hit (22.7%), but they’re working on it through pricing and cost controls

This was their first full quarter as a standalone company after separating from Western Digital. Still early.

**Other areas they’re moving into:**

* **EV**: Flash tech being used for autonomous driving, just nominated Ford Supplier of the Year. NOTE: I am not an EV person and haven't really gone down this rabbit hole. I'm just looking into the AI side.
* **Gaming**: Their new SSDs are winning “Best Of” awards
* **Content creation**: Rolled out pro-grade memory cards and high-performance portable SSDs

**Risks:**

* Gross margins were down this quarter—mostly due to pricing pressure and the usual NAND volatility
* Consumer segment is still soft
* Goodwill impairment made GAAP numbers ugly (-$1.8B), though this was non-cash and tied to the separation
* This is absolutely a lotto play.
* Thin options liquidity. I just got shares.

I could be wrong here, but that would also be very on-brand in this subreddit.

1l37l3m,2025-06-04,"1.3m $RDDT Bet - Too Many Ways to Win
[YOLO my retirement](https://preview.redd.it/b79sltwwbx4f1.png?width=2762&format=png&auto=webp&s=2da693c6e85ac91a950290dc6ef77677fb3fb36b)

**TL;DR:** Reddit is massively under monetized compared to peers (ARPU of $3.63 vs Meta's $12+), but sitting on the internet's highest quality dataset for AI training. They're already making $100M+ annually from OpenAI/Google at 90%+ margins, with new revenue streams emerging (hedge fund data via ICE, premium subreddits targeting the creator economy). Management has proven they can monetize without killing the community. Multiple ways to win (ARPU growth, data licensing expansion, creator monetization).

Thesis: Reddit is the last major platform with truly authentic, human driven conten and every dollar they make from data, ads, or subscriptions flows almost entirely to the bottom line. That combination (community moat + 90% margins + under monetized user base) means there are tons of ways for shareholders to win.

**Moat/Why Reddit Matters**

Reddit’s value is in its data. Unlike algorithmic feeds that amplify engagement optimized content, Reddit's community moderated format naturally filters for substantive discussion through upvoting and downvoting mechanisms. This creates a self curating dataset where quality content rises organically. Reddit's niche communities offer domain expertise at scale. Subreddits such as r/AskHistorians or r/PersonalFinance provide high quality, contextual knowledge that is hard to find elsewhere. While other platforms deal with increasing bot activity and AI generated content pollution, Reddit's community moderation creates natural quality controls. Compare this to Meta or Twitter, where content moderation costs eat into margins. Reddit's community does the curation work for free, then Reddit monetizes that curation.

 

That makes Reddit a data goldmine for LLMs.

This creates a flywheel of engagement that’s not only sticky for users but incredibly valuable to AI and advertisers.

* Reddit is already pulling in \~$100M/year from data licensing deals with OpenAI and Google.
* That revenue flows almost entirely to the bottom line, pushing gross margins >90%.
* Unlike ad reliant platforms, this is pure margin, recurring revenue.
* Reddit has content tagged by subreddit leading to specific and niche domain knowledge which is super valuable for AI training. 

**The CEO and Why Management Can Execute** 

Steve Huffman cofounded Reddit in 2005 but left in 2009 to pursue his own startup journey. At Hipmunk, he gained hands on experience with the monetization challenges Reddit would eventually face: negotiating ad partnerships, building affiliate revenue streams, and learning how to balance aggressive growth targets with maintaining user trust skills that weren't part of his original toolkit as a pure product founder.

When Huffman returned as CEO in 2015, Reddit was stagnant, 

traffic growth had slowed, leadership was paralyzed by fear of change, and basic revenue infrastructure was missing. But he now brought a different perspective, having personally wrestled with the complexities of turning user engagement into sustainable revenue.

His turnaround demonstrates he can execute on complex monetization without destroying community value. He overhauled the interface, built mobile functionality, and completely revamped Reddit's ad offerings. More importantly, he implemented content policies and moderator tools that preserved Reddit's authentic culture while making it advertiser friendly.

This experience matters for the opportunities ahead premium subreddits, expanded data licensing, international ARPU growth because they all require the same delicate balance Huffman learned through his entrepreneurial journey: extracting maximum revenue from unique community assets without killing what makes them valuable.

**Growth Catalysts**

**ARPU Tailwinds vs. Facebook/Google/Meta**

Reddit’s ARPU is currently well below its peers and management is actively working on closing the gap.

Current ARPU Gap:

* US ARPU: $6.21 (+31% YoY)
* Intl ARPU: $1.34 (\~5× lower than US)
* Global ARPU: $3.63 (+23% YoY)
* Google Benchmark: Google Services generated $77.3 b in Q1 2025 (including $50.7 b search), with €6.35 p/m in Europe (\~$76 per year).
* Meta Benchmark: Meta’s ARPP was $10.42 per user in Q1 2025 (\~$12.36 TTM).

If Reddit can even approach half of Meta’s or Google’s yield in key markets, ARPU can more than double from here. When Reddit doubles ARPU from $3.63 to \~$7, you're looking at revenue growth with 90%+ gross margins. Even with zero DAU growth, that's \~$3B in annual revenue. Add conservative 20% DAU growth to 130M users, and you're approaching $3.6B in revenue. Right now Reddit’s market cap is 20B with the potential to generate $500M+ in quarterly free cash flow at those levels. And here is how they are going to do it. 

To increase ARPU Reddit is rolling out:

1. New ad formats (video, search, shopping) & better targeting & analytics for advertisers
2. AI powered content recommendations (already +30% in “Good Visits”)
3. Global machine translation (30+ countries)

I’m unsure if Reddit Answers will move the needle but it shows that the team is shipping fast and not afraid to experiment. 

**Emerging Data Monetization Beyond AI Training**

Reddit is now piloting financial data products through ICE, selling real time sentiment analysis and trend identification to hedge funds. This presents another new potential revenue stream. While still early stage, the addressable market for financial sentiment data is enormous. If Reddit can demonstrate alpha generation from their community discussions, institutional demand could create substantial revenue. Reddit's threaded discussions and voting mechanisms create cleaner sentiment signals than traditional social media noise. If Reddit can prove their data moves markets, they're looking at potentially hundreds of millions in annual recurring revenue from the finance vertical alone.

The speculative angle is whether other industries (healthcare sentiment, brand monitoring, political analysis) follow suit once Reddit demonstrates the model works with financial services.

**The Trump Call**

Anger is the most contagious emotion, and Trump makes people furious, which translates directly to engagement and revenue. During Trump's 2017-2021 term, NYT stock tripled (+227%) on the back of outrage fueled subscription growth, proving that political chaos drives monetizable engagement. Reddit thrives in this environment even more than traditional media. The platform's political subreddits already drive massive traffic during controversies r/politics regularly dominates the front page during major news cycles, and angry users spend significantly more time on platform, driving ad revenue and engagement metrics. As Trump continues generating daily headlines and controversies, Reddit becomes the primary destination for realtime discussion and debate. Unlike passive news consumption, Reddit's format encourages users to engage, argue, and scroll for hours through comment threads. This sustained engagement during Trump's presidency should provide a meaningful tailwind for both user growth and time spent on the platform, directly benefiting Reddit's advertising revenue and data value.

**Premium Subreddits**

Right now, NSFW content creators are farming engagement on Reddit for free, then redirecting traffic off platform to make money elsewhere. Reddit sees none of that profit. Reddit has explicitly discussed that they are working on premium subreddits. This keeps users on platform, and skims off that monetization by allowing creators to monetize directly on platform, with Reddit taking a platform fee.

Think OnlyFans creators paying Reddit a cut instead of just leeching traffic. This represents 100% incremental revenue with virtually zero marginal cost to Reddit as they're already hosting the content and communities.

OnlyFans generated $6.6 billion in gross payments volume in 2023, translating to $1.3 billion in revenue at a 20% take rate and $657 million in pretax profit. If Reddit's premium subreddit model can capture even a small fraction of this creator economy by leveraging their existing massive NSFW user base and superior community features it could substantially add to their revenue mix.

**Near Term Catalysts**

Reddit faces several key institutional milestones that could drive significant passive capital inflows. Russell 1000/3000 inclusion is scheduled for June 27, 2025, after market close, which should trigger automatic buying from index tracking funds starting that Friday. More significantly, if Reddit maintains its current profitability trajectory and scale, S&P 500 eligibility could arrive by mid 2026. The company's Annual Investor Day on June 9, 2025. I’m unsure if anything will serve as a catalyst for anything I’ve mentioned here but I’m excited to hear what their team is working on. 

**The Google Risk and Why It Doesn’t Matter**

Reddit’s top line still depends heavily on Google’s search algorithm, so whenever Google tweaks its ranking, Reddit’s traffic and revenue can swing. After Reddit reported Q4 2024 results in late February, the stock sold off sharply when search rankings dipped. The same thing happened in May, despite a strong Q1 2025 beat (year over year revenue up 47%). On the Q1 call, Steve Huffman cautioned that “growth will be bumpy,” noting that April daily active user growth slowed to 17%. Then the stock gave up its gains.

In reality, those monthly fluctuations don’t change the bigger picture: Reddit is still adding users and monetizing them at a fast clip. Short term search volatility simply means revenue and growth will be bumpy, but the overall trend remains squarely upward. The market is overplaying Reddit’s “Google dependency”. Even with occasional dips, Reddit’s growth trajectory is intact. Ignore the volatility and focus on the overall trajectory.

1l36a78,2025-06-04,"Any near-term weakness in the S&P 500 will provide a “buy-low” opportunity
JP Morgan analysts said in a report on Wednesday, although the recent stock market rally has weakened, but any short-term pullback in large-cap stocks should be regarded as a “buy low” opportunity.

JP Morgan wrote: “Since mid-May, the stock market rally has either decelerated or stalled. Relevant signals increase the likelihood of a near-term price pullback.”

However, analysts at the bank still maintain a bullish stance on large-cap stocks, pointing to a strong medium-term trend.

JPMorgan says: “As long as the S&P 500 stays above the key 5600 level, the medium-term bullish outlook will continue.”

The bank added that large-cap leadership remains intact, “and we suspect that any short-term weakness in large-cap stocks will provide a ‘buy-low’ opportunity before testing cycle highs sometime this summer.”

JPMorgan also pointed to signs of weakness in cyclical sectors of the market, noting that the Russell 2000, materials and energy sectors have stalled near key resistance levels.

The firm added, “Commodity price action has reinforced signals in these two sectors.” And it singled out DuPont (NYSE: DD) and EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG) as examples of weaker allocations in both groups.

Conversely, JPMorgan noted that the healthcare sector would be a potential bright spot if the broader market weakens. “We also see the battered healthcare sector as an interesting long opportunity,” the analysts wrote, noting recent buy signals as well as near support levels. Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) is rated as an “attractive structure and chart pattern” stock.

1l35hg0,2025-06-04,"$APLD: This ain’t a stock. It’s a launchpad. Public Pureplay on the AI Bottleneck.
I’m long APLD.

Applied Digital is a developer of next-generation infrastructure for AI. They have two segments: (i) custom-built, high-performance data centers; and (ii) GPUs as a service. Applied is currently focused on a large 400MW data center project in Ellendale, ND, and is marketing a 1.4GW pipeline of additional capacity. Please see the company’s latest investor presentation on their website for more details. 

There is a frenzy for compute power by both hyperscalers and Fortune 500 companies, covered extensively everywhere you look. Power and datacenter capacity is the new bottleneck. Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen, has and continues to discuss the need to modernize a trillion dollars worth of data centers to tap into AI’s potential. APLD is a first mover aiming to capture this opportunity.

APLD’s history in developing power hungry crypto hosting sites in low-cost power locations was the perfect preparation for today’s AI opportunity. APLD’s foray into North Dakota for cheap electricity to fund crypto mining left the company with relationships and access to massive low cost power, low cost land with space for expansion, room for additional wind/solar farms to be integrated, state tax incentives, and cooler temperatures which are beneficial for the TCO of high density AI data centers. A healthy dose of luck contributed to locking up this opportunity, industry participants have told me you cannot underscore just how valuable this power and first mover advantage is for prospective customers. If GPUs are the pickaxes behind the AI revolution, power guys are swinging the axes.

**Unit Economics and Valuation**

**HPC Data Centers**
The rule of thumb for data centers is it costs $8-12 million per MW to build and each MW can generate ~$1mm of NOI. Applied Digital’s Ellendale campus has signed 250 MW of 15-year leases with CoreWeave, expected to generate $7 billion of total revenue over those 15 years (≈$466.7 million per year). That works out to ≈$1.867 million of revenue per MW per year. Assuming a typical HPC/data center EBITDA margin of 50–60 %, each MW will likely produce $0.9–$1.2 million of NOI per year. Therefore, the 250 MW currently under contract should yield $233–$280 million of NOI annually. At a 5–6 % cap rate, that implies an enterprise value (TEV) in the $3.9–$5.6 billion range for the signed 250 MW. If the full 400 MW build is leased at similar economics, total NOI would be $360–$480 million per year, implying TEV of $6–$9.6 billion. The remaining 150 MW of backlog could contribute up to $150 million of additional annual NOI—i.e., another $2.5–$3 billion of TEV—if signed at comparable rates. 

Locking in the 250 MW CoreWeave lease translates into roughly $3.3–$5.17b of equity, or about $15–$23 per share. Each additional 100 MW of backlog, using $0.9–$1.2 m of NOI per MW and a 5–6 % cap rate, would be worth approximately $5/share using the same math. If Applied is able to lock in 1.4GW of projects, that’s an additional $70/share of value that could be created. Haircut all of this however you prefer. The numbers can get wild.

**Applied Digital Cloud**
This segment has not been a focus for the company or the investment community recently, but is an underappreciated lotto ticket. Think of it as an early-stage CoreWeave. The business model is simple: they purchase GPUs from NVDA, install them in data centers, and lease them to customers for a fixed contract term that is typically 2-3 years. The GPUs typically pay for themselves during the initial lease term, leaving Applied Digital Cloud owning them free and clear at the end of the lease term for several more years of use. Applied takes very little risk here because at the time they purchase the GPUs there is already a contract in place for a full pay back of the equipment.

The NVDA investment is especially important for this segment because this is where NVDA can drive Applied’s future success. The hyperscalers are working on their own chips and are frienemies, so it is in NVDA’s long-term interest to ensure that there is a healthy ecosystem to support the consumption of their GPUs. They want companies like Applied and CoreWeave to prosper. NVDA can assure Applied’s success in a variety of ways by providing: (i) early allocations of the latest products; (ii) the best customer prospects who want to consume NVDA’s products as a service; and (iii) capital.

Consider what NVDA’s support did for CoreWeave. NVDA invested $100MM in CoreWeave in 2023 at a $2BN valuation. As of September 2024 CoreWeave was raising money at a $23BN valuation…. And look at where they are now. 

Valuing this segment is tricky because it is just getting started. If we assume it’s worth just 10% of CoreWeave, that’s $7BN. And it goes up from there. In the fullness of time, if Applied Digital Cloud prospers, then the company will spin this out as a separate company.   

**The High Level Setup**
Based on the recently announced data center lease with CoreWeave, it is clear that APLD is the real deal and has a chance to be a leader in the next gen data center buildout. BUT despite the recent surge in stock price, it has yet to go from zero to hero with the stock price still being vastly under valued.
 
Applied Digital will be the only pure play next-gen data center player in the public markets. There is no short thesis when NVDA and Related are anchor investors and a hyperscaler is a long-term partner and customer. APLD will fundamentally be worth a lot more than current prices, the stock should disconnect from any fundamental grounding as a result of being a public pureplay on the next AI bottleneck. The right tail asymmetry of this investment is under appreciated.  

**TLDR:** Company that used to mine magic internet money accidentally built a gold mine for AI. Now NVDA’s homies are renting it out, and the GPU gods might bless them with infinite tendies. Bags secured, brain not required

never thought I’d be making this post. But here we are.

After riding one of the longest bull streaks in recent history, I did what any overconfident degenerate would do—I let logic in the room. Rookie mistake. Within two weeks, I went from $300,000 to PDT-violated, margin-called, and spiritually humbled.

I’ve been buying $10,000 same-day expiry SPY puts since mid-April. Not a typo. Every. Damn. Day.

I’m not gonna lie—I was considering launching a hedge fund. Called my dad. Called my rich uncle. They were shocked, surprisingly supportive (while I was winning, and started to discuss hedge fund possibilities!

Turns out I wasn’t a quant. I just hit black five times in a row and thought I was Rain Man. Since then? Red. Every. Spin.

I’m a changed man. But also a scared one. Every time I think about buying a call, the market feels it and tanks out of spite. I swear Jerome Powell has my phone tapped.

But it’s okay.

I started my true bull journey yesterday. Vibes are up. Regret is high. Confidence is fake. But I’m here.

The $353K+ loss? That was originally $15K of my own money. So technically… I just gave back the market’s money, right?

Give me a month or two—once I clear this PDT scarlet letter—and I’ll be back. Or not. I don’t trust myself. And you shouldn’t either.

Let’s go, bulls. But stay paranoid.

God bless leverage.

I started a small position in Coreweave back in April of 50 shares. I then decided to buy my first call options as I liked the upside potential without owning the shares. Thought it would go well with 475 share position in NVDA. Do you think it goes higher from here? Should I let it ride or take some off the table?

Still holding onto shares but scared to do options. Might do a covered call Sell soon Derisk, sell your short-dated calls and buy shares if you're still bullish on CRWV. You've already captured most of the upside with 6 and 10 baggers. Any more is just pure greed. If you think you can be greedier, think about how you can 10x your 30k payout.

Used to swing trade, then completely liquidated (10 years ago) to from my home town across the country, get married, HYSA a couple $100K, get a finance person to hide some $ from me, buy a house, etc.

Decided to throw a meaningless chunk back in this year on a few high-conviction plays to remind my smooth brain of how to use buttons in Robinhood.

This AVGO call was one of them (bought in March for $4.45, sold today for $28.10). The other was NVDA, which I *should’ve* sold mid-May… still holding and hoping for a last 48hr pop, but not counting on it (that strategy is three $150's and one $160 exp 6/20).

Didn’t quite offset a down payment like I wanted, but I’m back in the green overall no matter how the NVDA's do and honestly just glad to be re-engaging with some parts of the market and have something to obsess over at 3AM instead of TikTok.

Thinking of either re-learning swing trading with the lift, or going deeper on options. Think the latter. Once I'm back in the red on my P&L, I'll really feel like myself again.

1l2iyt5,2025-06-03,"Trump to sign a directive today formally raising steel and aluminum tariffs to 50% from 25%
President Donald Trump will sign a directive on Tuesday formally raising steel and aluminum tariffs to 50% from 25%, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced. 

Trump said last Friday the higher charge will take effect on June 4, but Leavitt did not elaborate on the timing. The move raises trade tensions at a time when the US is locked in negotiations with numerous trading partners over his so-called “reciprocal” duties before a July 9 deadline. 

The president’s ability to unilaterally impose tariffs stands on shakier legal ground, after a federal court knocked down duties he announced under an emergency law. His levies on metals were not subject to that ruling. 

Trump announced the decision during a speech at a United States Steel Corp. plant in Pennsylvania on Friday, where he endorsed the sale of the company to Japan’s Nippon Steel Corp. while pledging that it would remain under some form of American control. 

“That means that nobody’s going to be able to steal your industry,” he told steelworkers Friday, in announcing the higher tariff. “It’s at 25%, they can sort of get over that fence; at 50% they can no longer get over the fence.”

He later announced in a social media post that the aluminum tariff would also rise to the same level.
Phew! Good thing milk and eggs don’t have steel in them. He just seems hell bent on raising the price of a new car Ok TACO, we believe you. Until you chicken out in about 48 hours. Today, I sign a directive to make Wendy’s Chicken Nuggets free. Children will be fine having two cars — perhaps three or five — instead of 30. TACO TUESDAY!!! Oh, shit! the economy is gonna BOOM! Why didn't we think of this sooner? Simply raise taxes on US companies by a fuck ton, and in turn, the consumer. Genius! Well it has iron molecules, not a lot but a few. 72 hours.

I deserved this — 
 
I went way too hard, way too fast on BA. As you’ll notice, my first and largest purchase of BA (402 shares @ $248.35) was on Friday, Jan 5, 2024 a little before close. What was significant about this day? This is the day the god damned door blew off the Alaska Air flight. Literally couldn’t have timed it worse. BA opened at $211.xx the following Monday and I’m instantly down 15%.
 
Since then I more than doubled my position and bought all the way down. I had way more in BA than I wanted and this position accounted for about 1/3 of my portfolio. Good thing I didn’t have that extra $180k to buy more NVDA shares when it was like $60. Fuck me. 
 
Anyway, today I am finally unstuck. I survived Liberation Day and all the other bullshit and endless bad press. Not going to be a pig… having BA drop to $200 or less would hurt WAY more than BA running to $240 would feel good. So ready to unload these bags and today I did. 
  
TL;DR — aped into BA early last year. Got slaughtered. Aped in even more. Finally got unstuck and made a whopping $250 for my troubles.

1l1p836,2025-06-02,"BYD - the next Evergrande?
For those that are unfamiliar with the story - Evergrande, once touted as too big to fail, [was the most valuable publically traded real estate developer in the world just 7 years ago](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-09/05/c_137446988.htm) with a market cap over 45 billion USD. Today, it is bankrupt.

While financial media will place the blame for Evergrande's fall on overleveraged lending, defualting mortgages, and collapsing housing prices; [Evergrande also frequently cut corners and ignored safety standards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKbLB_T-IjY&ab_channel=ADVChina) by using low-quality, or sub-standard building materials. [These are referred to in China as ""tofu dregs"" or ""tofu buildings.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tofu-dreg_project#:~:text=%22Tofu%2Ddreg%20project%22%20)

And today BYD is mired in a similar controversy surrounding it's EV sales practices in China - a story which could mimic the fall of Evergrande.

Although lany on WSB and in mainstream financial media like to proclaim BYD's dominance, often citing EV sales surpassing Tesla's - few are aware BYD's dirty secret.

BYD's vehicle sales have grown extraordinarily over the last decade from [430,000 in 2014](https://www.goodcarbadcar.net/byd-china-sales-figures/) to [4.3 million in 2024](https://tridenstechnology.com/byd-sales-statistics/). This has positioned [BYD as the #3 largest global automotive](https://roadgenius.com/cars/statistics/sales-by-manufacturer/) brand behind Toyota and VW in 2024, setting the stage for them to become #2 in 2025.

But recent criticism about BYD's sales practices from competitors brings into question the legitimacy of BYD's phenomenal growth.

Wei Jianjun, Chariman of China's Great Wall Motor, and other industry leaders are speaking out against a sales tactic employed by BYD referred to as [“zero-kilometre used cars.”](https://carnewschina.com/2025/06/01/exposing-chinas-zero-kilometre-used-cars-registered-but-never-driven/)

That strategy is simple but takes on a different name in the West where it is generally referred to as [""channel stuffing.""](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/channelstuffing.asp)

In practice, BYD and other EV manufacturers in China have been building an oversupply of vehicles and selling them to dealerships. This allows manufacturers to claim government subsidies for manufacturing EVs and meet short term sales targets.

Then the dealers offload the inventory on the market as a used vehicle (with 0 miles driven), at significantly reduced prices.

But this practice creates problems for the consumer. In China the warranty process typically begins at the vehicle registration date which starts when the car is sold to the dealership.

[And these vehicles will often sit on dealer lots or ""EV graveyards"" for months before they're sold,](https://mobilityportal.eu/ev-graveyards-europe-is-implementing-solutions/) leaving customer with reduced warranty coverage or worse.

In some cases, manufacturers have been taking advantage by cost cutting in important areas like paint and safety.The result is low quality cars are being deceptively sold ""as new."" 

This has lead to numerous issues with corrosion in BYD vehicles. [One social media user posted the undercarriage of his four year old BYD completely destroyed by rust](https://x.com/CharlesWBoy/status/1923343976980971751), swearing he will never buy another BYD again. 

[Similar stories surrounding a popular export model in Australia have been popping up.](https://autoexpert.com.au/posts/the-truth-about-the-byd-atto-3-ev-rust-problem) The main culprit appears to be a lack of adequate galvanization and/or dissimilar metal corrosion between some bolts and the subframe.

Some consumers are feeling scammed. BYD's warranty states ""Do not park the vehicle in dark and humid environment for long time; otherwise, **partial rusting and corrosion** of the chassis may occur."" And many of these cars are doing just that, as mentioned above, sitting in[ EV graveyards](https://mobilityportal.eu/ev-graveyards-europe-is-implementing-solutions/) before they're offloaded to the secondary market or exported.

In China, consumer protection laws are even worse and there is almost no legal recourse for such issues like the lemon laws consumers enjoy in the US. In China[, it's not uncommon for companies to sue consumers for defamation for speaking out against such practices.](https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/opinion/2024/05/06/faults-in-chinese-french-cars-show-urgent-need-for-lemon-laws)

[And BYD has done exactly that, suing a car blogger for $700,000 who posted videos criticizing BYD's car failures and fires.](https://cnevpost.com/2023/07/24/byd-sues-car-blogger-over-defamation/)

On May 27, 2025, everything came to a head. [China’s commerce ministry convened a meeting ](https://cnevpost.com/2025/05/27/chinese-regulator-gathers-automakers-zero-mileage-used-car-sales/)with major players, including BYD, Dongfeng Motor, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM), and the China Automobile Dealers Association (CADA). The subject was to discuss used car sales and the ""zero kilometer used car"" sale practice.

The China commerce ministry's intervention heralds stricter oversight and tighter regulations to come, which could prove problematic for major players like BYD.

But BYD may have other problems.

[EV makers in China are taking longer to settle payments with suppliers due to slowing sales and price wars, potentially signaling liquidity issues.](https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3263341/chinese-ev-makers-delay-payments-vendors-they-feel-heat-slowing-sales-price-cuts)

BYD took 275 days to pay supply-chain vendors in 2023, compared with 219 days in 2022, and 198 days in 2021, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.

NIO, a rival EV manufacturer, needed 295 days to pay suppliers, increasing from 247 days in 2022, and 197 days in 2021.

[Nigel Stevenson, an analayst at GMT Research (basically a Hong-Kong based Hindenburg Research), claims that BYD's net debt has surpassed 200% of its equity.](https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/here-s-why-china-s-ev-makers-have-a-good-reason-to-delay-paying-bills-125012200325_1.html) That number is dramatically different than what is reported on BYD's financial statements which indicate it holds more cash on it's balance sheet than debt.

This could explain why BYD's supplier payment period has been increasing for years. This effectively results in BYD receiving cash for a finished car before paying for the materials to build the same car - amounting to an interest-free loan from suppliers.

And this has been squeezing some suppliers out of business. In a social media post on Weibo, one journalist reported the story of a supplier who was forced to take out high-interest loans to cover debts because BYD had delayed paying them beyond 275 days. [According to national industry and commerce data, BYD is reportedly behind on 237.5 billion yuan in payments to suppliers—delays that have pushed 73 small and medium-sized suppliers into bankruptcy.](https://x.com/ray4tesla/status/1910581529123971408)

[By comparison, Tesla has recently shortened their supplier payment period from 100 days to 90 days in Shanghai](https://cnevpost.com/2024/11/28/tesla-china-payment-cycle-to-suppliers-90-days/). This has positioned Tesla as one of the friendliest automakers in China for suppliers to work with.

To add insult to injury, at the start of the year BYD asked suppliers to further cut prices by 10% in 2025 leading to backlash on social media and dissent from suppliers. [BYD's suppliers have put out statements condemning BYD's actions for violating business ethics](https://technode.com/2024/11/29/byd-suppliers-reportedly-dissent-over-latest-price-cut-request/) as well as endangering consumers because the only way to meet their demands is to reduce the quality of their products or using other ""unconventional measures"".

[Elsewhere in the world BYD has recently been scrutinized for its relationship to Jinjiang Group.](https://globalvoices.org/2025/03/10/after-complaints-of-mistreatment-of-chinese-workers-in-brazil-byd-watched-employees-closer/) Jinjiang Group is one of three companies BYD partnered with to outsource the construction of a factory in Brazil. In December 2024 a government task force rescued 163 Chinese workers from slavery-like conditions. Employees were made to work without protective equipment, 12 hour daily shifts, and threatened with physical violence. Some workers had their passports confiscated and part of their salaries confiscated. 

Could this be an example of the other ""unconventional measures"" alluded to by suppliers above? It almost certainly seems that way.

So what does all of this mean for BYD? Is BYD destined to be the next Evergrande? Is BYD too big to fail?

In the short-to-medium-term BYD probably wont go bankrupt. In the to long-term i think there's increased risk. The thing about the EV market in China is it's extremely competitive. [In 2023 there was 100 different EV manufacturers in China, down from 500 in 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle_industry_in_China) (many of these scams). In the future, probably a dozen or less will remain. And what BYD is doing is accelerating the timeline.

The advantage that BYD has is that it's not just a carmaker, but also one of the biggest national manufacturers of batteries.[ But the battery supply market in China has also been increasingly under pressure in recent years with prices plunging by more than 50% since 2023.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-09/china-s-batteries-are-now-cheap-enough-to-power-huge-shifts)

Yet despite the intense competition in the battery and automotive markets, BYD has repeatedly managed to post record high [gross margins above 20%.](https://cnevpost.com/2025/04/25/byd-earnings-q1-2025/) Margins which are probably only sustainable due to BYD's unethical, sometimes illegal, business practices. But these kinds of underhanded tactics can't last forever and it's possible something could trigger an Evergrande-like event. A record high debt:equity ratio, defaults on its loans, tighter regulations, and an increasingly heated price war all pose a risk. Perhaps that's why Berkshire and Buffett have been quietly cutting their former 10% stake in BYD down to less than 5% last year (under the reporting threshold).

But with a market cap over $150 billion USD, nearly 4 times the peak of Evergrande, it's probably unlikely BYD goes bankrupt. Besides, BYD is too important to China as a national behemoth in the new energy economy. Still it seems unlikely that BYD can continue to grow at the same pace, or maintain it's record high gross margins, if either of those depend on its continued use of unethical business practices outlined above.

And then there's the threat of autonomous driving which could totally revolutionize transport. By all accounts i've seen, Tesla's FSD is the best performing software available in China. IF Tesla's FSD proves to be as good as some expect, the deployment of hundreds of thousands to millions of autonomous taxis could be an extinction level event the entire industry.

Anyway, not financial advice, and i have no idea what will happen to BYD. Personally i wouldn't take a position in BYD in either direction. It's such a massive player in batteries and EVs in China that it may very well be ""too big to fail,"" but that doesn't mean it can't be damaged. More broadly i think both industries will continue to see intense competition in the future and many smaller players will be forced into bankruptcy, mergers, or acquired.

Godspeed, regards.
[deleted] Your post is so long, no one read it. So what you are saying is in the near term BYD will be the most valuable car company in the world? BYD produces real products that people want and they aren’t made of cardboard… they are nothing alike and this write up was dumb BYD has 20B USD in Cash.
Its liquid as fuck. Evergrande isnt/wasnt.

**Jobs Report Comes As Fed Faces Pressure on Interest Rates**  
The scheduled Friday release of the May U.S. jobs report will show whether the labor market continues to exhibit strength after employers added more jobs than analysts expected in April, as the unemployment rate remained at 4.2%.

Trump has been applying pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates from their current levels of 4.25% to 4.5%. Fed officials have said that they are in “wait-and-see” mode as the labor market remains strong and inflation comes under pressure from U.S. tariffs.

Earlier in the week, market watchers will get updates on job openings, private-sector payrolls, and weekly jobless claims.

Several Fed officials are scheduled to speak, including Federal Reserve Chair Powell, Dallas Fed President Logan, Chicago Fed President Goolsbee, and Philadelphia Fed President Harker. On Wednesday, the Fed’s Beige Book will provide more details on economic conditions throughout the country.

The Thursday scheduled report on the U.S. trade deficit comes as tariff threats have pushed shippers to increase imports ahead of the expected import taxes.

Investors will also be watching manufacturing and services industry surveys scheduled for release this week, as well as updated data on consumer credit levels, factory orders, and construction spending.

**Tech, Retail Earnings Reports in Focus**  
Chipmaker Broadcom’s scheduled financial report, due Thursday, comes on the heels of industry leader Nvidia’s (NVDA) report last week that showed continued demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products. Broadcom reported a 77% jump in its AI-related revenue in its most recent financial release as company executives forecast continued growth in that sector.

Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike Holdings is expected to release its earnings on Tuesday. The firm said in early May that it planned to cut 5% of its workforce. Guidewire Software, which provides services to insurance providers, is also expected to deliver an update on its AI products Tuesday.

Logistics software provider Descartes Systems Group is expected to release its earnings on Wednesday. Shippers continue to grapple with the impact of Trump's tariffs on the supply chain.

With consumer sentiment surveys showing increasing concerns over economic conditions, investors will be watching reports from retailers for signals on spending. Scheduled reports from Dollar General on Tuesday and Dollar Tree and Five Below on Wednesday will provide a look at consumer traffic at those stores. Campbell’s scheduled report on Monday will shine a light on food spending, while fashion brands Lululemon and Calvin Klein parent PVH also will be reporting.

Other noteworthy reports this week include Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO, a competitor to Tesla in that country, and information technology provider Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

1kznxun,2025-05-31,"UNH YOLO & Thesis
I'm betting over half my port on UNH. All shares because I still have a few brain cells left.

  
**Here is my theory as to why it will go up in the short term:**

UNH Dividend Raise: 

2022 Annual shareholder meeting: **06/06** 

2022 Dividend raised from $1.45 to $1.65: **06/08** 

2023 Annual shareholder meeting: **06/05** 

2023 Dividend raised from $1.65 to $1.88: **06/07** 

2024 Annual shareholder meeting: **06/03** 

2024 Dividend raised from $1.88 to $2.10: **06/05** 

The 2025 annual shareholder meeting: scheduled for **06/02** Which means, the dividend level will be announced on Wednesday **06/04**. This will send the stock soaring or crashing. Let’s be real though, the insiders wouldn’t have spent millions of their own money on shares at $288, if they knew they were slashing the dividend level. 06/04. They would have waited until after that announcement to buy. This is common sense, there is no other reason in the world that the insiders would have bought with their own money, besides they think the stock is going up, and at the time they bought, they know where the dividend level is headed on Wednesday. 

For reference, here is a listing of the recent insider purchases (yes this is from ChatGPT. Cry.)

* **Stephen Hemsley (CEO)**
   * Shares Purchased: 86,700
   * Average Price: $288.57
   * Total Purchase: \~$25 million
   * Date: May 2025
* **John Rex (President & CFO)**
   * Total Purchase: \~$5 million
   * Date: May 2025
* **Board Directors (3 directors)**
   * Purchases: N/A details
   * Date: May 2025

  
**Here is my theory as to why it will go up in the long term:**   
Blue chip stock. Will appeal/settle with the DOJ. Will provide guidance when its clear if pharma tariffs are sticking. It's too big to fail (like Enron/Lehman Brothers),

**TLDR;** The Dividend level will be raised this Wednesday, which will encourage faith in the company, and start the recovery of the share price.

Feel free to thank me on Thursday!

Also remember this is a defense stock, it’s very unaffected by tariffs or political issues.

1lnf37q,2025-06-29,"Changes to my port - builds welcome
Current port: 41% spyl, 17% nvda, 7% other us stocks. 35% cash. Majority of cash is usd, smaller part eur. I have got my income in eur. The usd cash comes from reducing my exposure to nvda.

The spring dip found me cashless so now i like the idea of holding some cash for opportunistic dip buys - and god knows whats in store for us re tariffs, wars etc.
I'd also like to diversify towards rest of the world but with usd having lost of its value i wonder if its a good idea now (however usd further weakening is now more probable than it becoming stronger)
My risk tolerance is quite good, my timeframe is long.

Plan: add 5% tencent, 5% byd, 10% exus etf. The former 2 i find undervalued and expect them to do better than the emerging markets in general. Exus for developed world and peace of mind.
Keep 15% cash.
To do the above i need to convert some usd to eur which im not sure is wise now, i could use my new incomes to build up exus over time.
I am also eyeing dell but maybe i have enough exposure there with nvda.

Thats where i am right now...any views?
You are basically long USD with your cash position. I would not feel good with that.

I would definitely feel better by investing it right away or converting it to eur, even when its at a loss.

1lnbqyv,2025-06-29,"Target Date Fund or current line up?

I have a 401K with Empower through my employer. These are my current investments: 

- Vanguard Institutional 500 Index Trust (56%)
- Vanguard Institutional Extended Market Index Trust (20%)
- Vanguard Institutional Total International Stock Market Index Trust (19%)
- Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Trust (5%)

Would it be beneficial to just do a JPMCB Target Date Fund 2060 or keep what I have? 
No need for a target date fund. They are often more expensive when it comes to expemse ratios. Go with index funds and just buy some bond funds in your 50s. Target date funds are often too conservative imo buying too much bonds/fixed income. It’s impossible to tell the future but almost certainly a 100% stock mix is going to beat out a mix of stock and bonds over the long run. 

Another thing to pay attention to in 401ks is expense ratios as sometimes the limited options in the plan can have really high expenses, not always apparent either. 

I have 1% of my income going to 401k (not eligible for match yet and rather put into IRA with full freedom into where I invest) and that’s coming out to like $27 every 2 months. The expense ratio is pretty low but noticed a fee of $21 went out. Not investing much at all here but found out once a quarter most of a contribution is wiped out by a fee haha. Plus they underperform by quite a margin, from what I saw last time I looked into it averaging 4% over the long haul 😬


Edit; I don't remember where I saw that but apparently the median return is 6.6% not terrible actually now I see why people use them. If you don't want to keep your eye on the market and pick individual stocks I would recommend just doing an s&p 500 etf like voo or spy Yeah I'm in a target 2045 and it already wants 20% bonds. I remember reading somewhere that it tends to under perform too which is why I picked my current line up after doing some research. I guess the Target Fund is just more convenient but not worth sticking with if it’s going to under perform. Also, do you think rebalancing every year is necessary? Underperform compared to what? 

Most of what folks point to is looking at the globally diversified portfolio versus only US. US has done really well the last 15 years, but looking at longer timescales we see it doesn't retain that advantage. The risk profiles of a single country versus all countries are not the same as well. 

The other thing is bonds, but a TDF won't enter appreciable numbers of those until close to retirement. 

4% APY is way lower than TDFs will have performed unless you're looking at the average well through retirement. At that point much of it is going to be mostly bonds, and so the risk profile is drastically different than someone who is 100% SPY. Most people would not advocate for that sort of portfolio in retirement though.

https://www.callan.com/target-date-index/ may be interesting data for you. Across all TDFs, for instance, the 2050 funds averaged 14.80% APY over the last five years for the best 10% of funds, and the lowest 10th percentile was at 12.59% for the same period. It’s contradictory to me. The people most likely to be in them also least likely to be constantly checking and panic sell so they don’t really need bonds.

1lmux19,2025-06-28,"Simple easy TQQQ strategy using the 200 SMA from QQQ with a few modifications
In my testing TQQQ is an absolute monster of an ETF that performs extremely well even from a buy and hold standpoint over long periods of time, its largest drawback is the massive drawdown exposure that it faces which can be easily sidestepped with this strategy.

This strategy is meant to basically abuse TQQQ's insane outperformance while augmenting the typical 200SMA strategy in a way that uses all of its strengths while avoiding getting whipsawed in sideways markets.

**The strategy BUYS when price crosses 5% over the 200SMA and then SELLS when price drops 3% below the 200SMA. Between trades I'll be parking my entire account in SGOV.**

So maximizing profit while minimizing risk.

You use the strategy based off of QQQ and then make the trades on TQQQ when it tells you to BUY/SELL.

Here are some reasons why I will be using this strategy:

* Simple emotionless BUY and SELL signals where I don't care who the president is, what is happening in the world, who is bombing who, who the leadership team is, no attachment to individual companies and diversified across the NASDAQ.
* \~85% win percentage and when it does lose the loses are nothing compared to the wins and after a loss you're basically set up for a massive win in the next trade.
* Max drawdown of around 40% when using TQQQ
* You benefit massively when the market is doing well and when there is a recession you basically sit in SGOV for a year and then are set up for a monster recovery with a clear easy BUY signal. So as long as you're patient you win regardless of what happens.
* The trades are often very long term resulting in you taking advantage of Long Term Capital Gains tax advantage which could mean saving up to 15-20% in taxes.
* With only a few trades you can spend time doing other stuff and don't have to track or pay attention to anything that is happening.
* Simple, easy, and massively profitable.

Below are some stats from the strategy running from 2001 with a script you can copy and paste into TradingView to make the same chart I'll be using.

r/LETFs spilling over to r/investing 🤣

My exact strategy but I implement GLD, BTC, and CTA even in the full leverage portfolio.

For some reason people here aren’t very fond of leverage nor LETFs even though LETFs are much safer than margin. Pretty sweet, thanks! I can’t tell if you’re factoring in volatility decay here but if not you need to. A triple leveraged fund should return triple the return daily but over the course of say a month 10% won’t turn into 30% because of volatility. retail investors arnt fond of it, most institutional investors of course use leverage.

  
the issue is that leverage daily resetting etfs are the most expensive and worst way to implement leverage.  you should use futures (here NQ stock index futures) This strategy seems solid for capturing downtrend recovery. What’s your typical holding period? This is similar to what I do. >For some reason people here aren’t very fond of leverage nor LETFs even though LETFs are much safer than margin.

The debate in this sub on use of leverage tends to be about leverage efficiency. I think that many people in this sub that use leverage tend to prefer to use futures instead of letfs or margin.

I can see an argument for using letfs though. There are a few strategies that can be easier to implement with letfs than with futures.

Although - if someone didn't want to use futures - I think you can accomplish more efficient leverage borrowing via a box to leverage instead of using letfs.

As for margin - I don't think many leveraged investors would ever advocate using margin loans. 😁 Due to volatility decay as well as lending costs of TQQQ you would look to see a 2.4-2.8x return compared to QQQ over longer periods but this varies a lot due to a variety of factors

1lmezya,2025-06-28,"Would you buy NVDA AMD AMZN NFLX now?
These stocks are at ATH or at least up there somewhere.  Would you get in now or wait to buy the dip? And if you’re already holding, should you sell and wait for the dip and get back in?  I know you’re not supposed to time the market but there’s a good chance that they’ll dip lower than current prices at some point, what are your thoughts?
No, its the weekend markets are closed I don't sell anymore. I sold 30 of my 36 Nvidia shares pre the 1 to 10 and 1 to 4 split. Never again. I’ve been buying NVDA since 2019, most of the dates I have purchased have been when it was at ATH. Some of those purchases were at 400% ago… I brought AMD around $10 and sold around $13 to ""lock-in my profits""  And if I’d bought Amazon I would be in Venice with Jeff right now. All of which is a good argument for ETFs of course. I was buying NFLX at 12-15-18-22-30.  

Rode it to 100 where it sat for over a year.   

Then, all the other streaming services were coming. 
So, I sold it . I figured it had maxed out and the other streaming services were going to take their part of the pie.  Plus, I didn't want NFLX to end up like Redbox. 

I made a lot of money, but it's still the Biggest stock mistake of my life . AMD is not ATH. Winning stock keeps to be at ATH. Question: can they deliver more growth? If you bought cisco at their ath 25 years ago you would be down ~1% not adjusting for inflation… Don’t know if this helps or not but I have young kids (<2).

Narrative stocks aren't worth it bro in what universe can we justify Tesla's P/E? Full EV dominance? They're not even close. It's great for speculative stocks in bull markets but next bear market Tesla is probably going to be $100. I mean you’re wrong on so many levels… I work in the autonomous space and Waymo isn’t even in the same league as far as quality goes - it’s far superior. The jury is very much still out on whether Tesla can pull off FSD with only cameras. So far, it’s not looking great…their pilot was clearly rushed with only 5-10 cars on the road, an employee in the car, and a number of problematic moves in the first day. Their cars also cannot operate in poor weather - best of luck to them on making cameras work when there’s literally things blocking them. 

My hunch is that LiDAR will continue to drop in price (down 90% since 2915) and Tesla will be forced to adopt it to meet regulatory standards, who knows how long elons hubris will prevent them from accepting that, though

I think the reality is that, if you own FSD (as I do) or have taken a robotaxi, you know that stuff isn’t good enough to be completely unsupervised. Even cruise, for all their efforts, only took 1 shady accident to sink the entire company and relying on only cameras makes that a not if but when They’re far behind Waymo on robotaxi… robotic? 😂 Doesn’t matter how the stock is performing. It only matters how the company is doing, and things haven’t gone too good lately. Tesla is however a meme stock, but $500 is a tall order even for Tesla. 

Ask yourself, if you liquidated your position today, would you still buy Tesla tomorrow? If not, sell it all! Oh now it makes more sense. If I had made a few million off of tesla I’d be in here spouting delusional takes as well. The question seems be be based on sunk cost. That makes any answer bunk. You don't base any forward buy/sell on sunk cost. Hahaha hey everyone check out this guy that thinks PE matters. The whole world hates Elon Musk.  You should sell and keep what you have left and make more informed stock purchases in the future.  Best of luck.

1lm22an,2025-06-27,"I need some advice on fixed-income ETFs
So SPY has been really great and has made me some good money. I am always looking for ways to diversify my portfolio and bring in passive income. Can someone explain how fixed-income ETFs work vs other types of ETFs? Like is this a set it and forget it type of situation like SPY is or do they have a shelf life like CD's and Treasury Notes where I will need to remember to sell it? ( I look at my account almost daily so I'm not actually forgetting about it. More needing to know if this is more of a short-term investing rather than long term) 
Most (not all) will keep somewhat a constant duration so they are basically set and forget

Meaning if you buy some intermediate term bond ETF it will have some constant duration of something like 5-7 years and stay that way

You can hold it for 20 years as internally it will sell bonds as they drop off and buy bonds to give some average duration of 5-7 years

However there are some newer ishares ETFs called iBonds (not to be confused with the inflation linked treasury bonds ) that will have some maturity date.

Meaning these will have lower duration the longer you hold them sort of like holding an actual bond Closer to set and forget, but you have to watch to look for any that shift to a sell rating. I use [morningstar.com](http://morningstar.com) ratings for every purchase decision, funds, stocks and ETFs. The ones I added to our portfolio after retirement were all well rated. Morningstar Premium is available at your library or for a few hundred a year subscription. 

I own these short term bond funds (I don't own any other bonds): SKOR, PULS, FLRN

And these derivative income funds: CCI, AMT, STAG, AMZY

You may also consider some dividend choices: VIG,  VYM, VYMI, MLPX Thanks for that explanation. That makes a lot of sense and clears up my confusion as to how they work. Seems like I may want to stay away from the iBonds as this is for my IRA accounts. I was looking at some Eaton Vance ones and am not sure which ones are actually good. Do you have any recommendations on specific fixed-income ETFs? Fixed-Income ETFs are good but DO require cyclical management....they are not set and forget; they are also not Value-Based products, meaning the Value is not in the strike but the Distributions.  Almost all the good ones are 1x Leveraged...the great ones are 2-3x but annual distributions (so Day-trader products).

\----

If you want comfort without management, look into Preferred Stocks (no DRIP)....make sure you buy in less than its Face Value (FV).  

For instance, 

>$STRK is currently at a $5-6 Premium ($105.68/sh), it has a $100 FV; however, it pays $8/yr (8% \* FV) with a quarter distribution of $2; Technically you would have recovered the Premium after the 3rd quarter and it is Perpetual with no real Call Data, it has a Earliest Call Date.  


>$SOJD is currently at a $5+/- Discount ($19.93/sh), it has a $25 FV, pays out 1.2375 (4.95% \* FV) each year with distributions quarterly (0.309375/qtr); It has a Call Date of 1/30/2080, yes 2-0-8-0

You need to assess your own risk and ability to manage, that will identify which instruments you choose.

LETFs can exceed 70% ROI in a single year; MSTY is on track to be 130-160% Yield.....Their caveat is NAV erosion if mismanaged or their strategy is too weak for the holdings IV. most brokerages will let you set up automatic buying on CD's, I've never played around to much with them but I know you can set it up that way.  

Bond funds and fixed income etfs generally hold an inverse relationship to interest rates, rates go up, bond fund values go down.  

Personally I like PFF which isn't really a bond fund but acts like one.  It's a preferred bank stock ETF and pays a better dividend rate than a lot of funds.  I find the preferred stock they hold to be better quality than whats held in a lot of other preferred stock etfs.  

If you want to mix it up and get dividend income, dividend etfs, CD's, bonds, REITS.  There are dual mandate ETFs which have a portion for growth with the bulk going to income producing, growth/income etfs. SPY’s been solid, but adding fixed-income ETFs can feel like stepping into a whole different game. Unlike CDs or Treasuries that mature, fixed-income ETFs don’t “expire”they just keep rolling over the bonds inside, so you’re not lockd into a timeline, but you’re also not guaranteed to get your full principal back like with a bond held to maturity. And yeah, they can be more stable than stocks, but they’re still senstve to interest rate swings, so it’s not exactly a “set it and forget it” deal either.

What’s your main goal with adding themmore steady income, or just trying to smooth out the ride when stocks get jumpy? Thanks for this explanation. It's definitely helpful and points me in a direction for research. Thanks! I had no idea you could set up the automatic buying for CD's. I haven't personally ever invested in them but have been curious. I have O in my account (REIT). I think most of my stocks pay dividends. I'm gonna look into PFF and some dual mandate ETFs. I think I am creating balanced retirement accounts but I still want to find the best ways to create passive income/growth. Not fixed income in the traditional, strictest sense. But dividends have been better income for most of the last 30 years, it's just the last 5 or so when interest rates got higher again.

The holdings in these have a combination of growth and income possibilities.

1llww1a,2025-06-27,"Help! Friend was promised a 1900% or MORE ROI
Hi all! ok as the title says. my friend was promised: invest $5k USD and get a return of $100k + in 24 months OR he could step out of the investment early if he wants his $5k back and still make triple what he put down in only 12 months - 24 months

EDIT: just to add to this, the guy who owns this business also contacts my friend regularly and sets up video conferences with those who invested to update them on their investment growth  so hes doing the most to make it seem legit

CONTEXT:

Long story short, my friend along with a bunch of other regular people (not rich, not business owners, just individuals who want to invest a small amount of money) got invited to this opportunity to invest in this company called ""triple bet"" you can google it and find the site

My friend received a pitch, the entire investment plan/blueprint, WHY to invest and how much growth is anticipated.

The ""owner"" of this company claimed that this is a legit, protected investment and even had them sign ""legal documents"" to protect themselves in this investment.

The owner invited this group to his house (some huge mansion in Drake'es area) then explained that this gambling software its in its early stages and already has other investors putting millions of dollars into it. He needed a few people to pitch in $5k USD each and in return they get a share of this company and will earn a huge return of money when this blows up.

My friend is now relying on this investment and truly believes he'll turn $5k int over $100k or even more. He thinks its going to blow up and be huge cause gambling is a billion dollar industry.

I really am skeptical and i dont at all think its legit or realistic to get such a huge return.

I told my friend not to put all his eggs in one basket and just wait for one investment to blow up cause it may not even be legit.

Has anyone ever invested in a gambling product like this that yielded such a large return? Im truly not the most financially literate but this just doesnt seem legit to me and im worried he put his $5k into a scam

AND if this is a scam - how could this guy arrange for people to just come into his mansion like that and show his cars and idk how he couldve thought this out so far without being afraid of getting the cops called to his house or something once people realize its a scam
Don't put the link in your post. No need to give the scammers any more clicks. Absolutely a scam All I see are 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩 If the guy selling your friend on the offer really believed this, he'd mortgage his house or get a personal loan to finance it himself.  This is beyond a bad idea This is a thinly veiled advertisement for the scam [removed] Scam. They already have millions of dollars from other investors, but just need a few more people putting in $5k? Doesn't make sense at all. Rented Mansion.

1llw3x5,2025-06-27,"Are there any advantages across different brokerages?
Hi all,

Right now I’ve got my Roth IRA through JPM Chase and I’ve got a HYSA and Individual Brokerage through E*Trade. 

Are there any fundamental differences between these accounts and a Roth/Brokerage through, say, Fidelity, Robinhood, Schwab, etc?

Thanks in advance!



Investment platforms like Schwab/Fidelity have more robust tools available to view your investments and do research.

In my experience, the bank platforms (Chase/Citibank,etc) tend to be more bare bones.

If you are just a buy and hold type of investor probably doesn't matter what platform you use. yes, platforms can be more restrictive in allowing options trading. They can offer or not offer products like 529, HSA, Coverdells.  They can have better tools for day trading like desktop trading.  They can offer futures trading.  

They can also reward you for bigger relationships, generally this is the banks that do it.  BofA gives you higher credit card rewards for larger relationship, MS and Schwab do as well. Yes - there can be big differences between brokers. But a lot of the differences depend heavily on the types of services that you need and desire.

The pros/cons can vary heavily depending on an investor's style.

For the majority of investors who only buy and hold funds - it usually comes down to things like customer service and potentially aggregate incentives.

See the subreddit wiki for some factors that can impact how to select a broker here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/index/gettingstarted/#wiki\_how\_do\_i\_choose\_a\_broker\_to\_invest.3F](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/index/gettingstarted/#wiki_how_do_i_choose_a_broker_to_invest.3F) Differences can include: 

* fees (account maintenance, trading, margin, etc) 
* types of accounts available
* selection of mutual funds offered without fees
* customer service
* locality of offices
* tools, mobile accounts, APIs, etc
* bonuses for having lots of money with them (credit card cashback, mortgage loan rate reduction, etc) 

These matter more or less to different people. You can also move accounts across brokerages fairly easily, so if you don't have a reason to move now don't worry about locking yourself in. Check out the fidelity core position model.  You earn hysa interest on ALL your cash.  Every day.  No need for a separate acct or emergency money.  It’s all there, earning and liquid all the time. > Are there any advantages across different brokerages?

* Costs. And this is not just the brokerage fees (if any), some brokerage houses will execute your trades more efficiently and at better prices than others.
* Customer service: today I had a couple of silly questions, so I called (on the phone, yeah, like in 1983) Fidelity and I spoke with someone who was very knowledgeable and addressed any and all my questions. Bonus, they spoke English. It was the first time in over 10 years.
* Physical presence might be important to some. I once had an issue and it was easy to go to a Fidelity branch and have the rep take care of things right there and then.

I have had my Fidelity account open for a very long time (LOL, I am old). IMO Fidely and Charles Schwab are the best.

I also have a Robinhood for shits and giggles, but nothing seruous going on there, I just don't trust it with serious money.

But I have a small position in $HOOD, just because it's not for me, doesn't mean that it's not a good play. 100%. For bonus. Not sure why you are downvoted. Fidelity with zero expense index funds options is objectively best. Vanguard's terrible interface is clearly the last choice I'd go with. All 3 are still better than other choices out there like etrade. Lol! I have used them all, passed my NASD exam in 1981, worked for a company that was a trustee of pension and profit sharing funds, IRA accounts, HR10, 401k, etc., trained CFP’s, Attorneys, and CPA’s on tax research content and software, I am a co-trustee of a trust, manage portfolios, so I don’t worry about down votes on social media, about who likes Vanguard, Schwab, or Fidelity.

1llvdi5,2025-06-27,"14M Portfolio - Need Financial Planner Advice
So, here is what I’m looking for…

I have 20M, 14M of that is currently invested in the stock market, bonds and PE funds. My financial planners (I have 2 firms, a big name one and a local outfit), have both done OK. I don’t think either has beat the S&P over the last few years, but due to high concentration of a few companies really running it up, that somewhat makes sense for a diversified portfolio.

What is annoying me about the plans is how safe they are. I understand. I only need to make five or 6% a year but at the same time I would like to be able to capture some big upsides on stock like NVDA, PLTR, CRCL… etc. 

Basically I want some of this money to be a little more risky and in the hands of someone looking for big opportunities.

What kind of financial planner I need for that? I’d like to take a few million and give it to them. Almost feels more like a hedge fund or something. 

I’m just not sure where to start the search.
You inherited 20m and you're worried about outperforming the S&P? That feels counterproductive Simply tell them you want to set aside x amount of money let’s say 1M for high risk and high reward. They love the idea of preserving wealth but also can do risky stuff if you tell them. 

Financial planners are not to beat SP but preserve wealth. You don’t want to lose 40% when the market down turns and cannot recover. 

Or cash out a 1M and put it into a brokerage and go gambling your self. Underperforming can be a good thing. Not point in taking on market risk if you're already a made man. This is why hedge funds (supposedly) exist: to hedge against the market. If you can make a safe 5-6% forever on $20M ($1M a year income), why risk weathering a 40-50% market drop. imagine having 20M yet not understanding where to even begin you're paying tens of thousand to some firms so that they underperform S&P for you.  
Are you hiring? I can underperform very well! Has to be inherited I thought you meant 14/m portfolio advice A financial planner, in good faith, shouldn’t be trading to necessarily beat a benchmark like the S&P500. Very few managers out there can do that consistently. CFPs are usually focused on getting you to a target/goal and advising on that. At 20M/14M invested, it’s about what you are looking for - from your post it sounds like you want 5-6% growth (is that pre or post tax/inflation) with exposure to certain companies.
  
I’d ask your CFPs if they can put together a sample portfolio of ETFs that will have low expense ratio and sit at the S&P500 level (mix in some mid to small cap ETFs and maybe something VXUS) then sprinkle in some of those individual stocks you might like. Any CFP should be able to advise on what to expect including drawdowns and expectations on growth.  
  
Additionally, if you want to test your CFPs ability I’d request a sharpe ratio and information ratio. You can compare that to different benchmarks to see if the risk you are taking on is worth the return you are getting. “Is my return worth the risk” should be the focus of conversation 99% of the time anyways. 6% can be achieved by S&P500 over the long run. 1% can be achieved in many different ways but they all add in risk, the idea is to achieve that 1% with the smallest risk as possible (usually done by looking for uncorrelated positions).  

Goodluck.

1ll67k7,2025-06-26,"Rate my diversification strategy where
I went on a huge stock buying spree this week in my PA. I picked a top name from nearly each sector. Curious what everyone’s thoughts are on the names I picked and the strategy at large. 
*AMD and NVDA are my most heavily weighted positions. I’m mostly equal weight in everything else.*

Here’s the breakdown of the port by sector:

1. IT: APP, NVDA, AMD (I owned PLTR earlier this year and sold for roughly 100+% profit - no current position)

2. Energy: EPD, GEV

3. Consumer Discretionary: BKNG, DIS

4. Comm services: GOOGL

5. Healthcare: LLY

6. Financials: BRK.B

7. Industrials: CAT

8. Consumer staples: WM

9. Materials: MP

10. Utilities: AEP
the nice thing about actually working on the buy side is my trusty blp terminal, using monthly data from 1960 to now, the rolling 1y correlation between gold and core cpi floats  between +15% and -15% its shockingly static, the largest positive correlation (indicating a hedge, cpi up, gold up) is about 40% for a month in 1970, and 2 months in 1978.  it never got above 20% after that.

  
what you're mistaking for data, is something ""you just know to be true"" because everyone says gold is a hedge for inflation.  it's not.  what that statement is, is marketing, designed to sell gold to old people.  its been happening since the 70s, its sad because theres no value in holding physical gold. If you’re diversifying then the portfolio is not short term is that correct? 

The premise is counterintuitive if you plan on selling any of these alone. The sectors that have one position… as soon as you sell one you’re less diversified across the portfolio. 

Why not own an ETF of each sector? 

None of this is meant to be snide. Just trying to understand and learn myself 😎 I don’t really count that as “diversified” since you’re still purely exposed to equities and nothing else. When equities go down, they all go down with the exception of maybe healthcare and utilities. You can check rolling beta correlations on testfol.io.

There’s equities, bonds, crypto, real estate, managed futures, and gold. True diversification is where the asset classes are noncorrelated with each other. I would also not count investing in International stocks as enough diversification either despite many people saying to do so since they’re also just equities and follow closely with US stocks.

My tip is pick your top equities, then diversify into other assets. What if I told you there are countries outside the United States? Take the red pill Neo, and you will realize the reality - where countries you only see in explosion pictures in US news actually have economies too.

  
In all seriousness, you aren't diversified at all because you:

1. Hand picked winners based on performance instead of buying the whole economy. Line goes up forever is true only until it isn't. whatever you think is the next Google won't be as decades pass

2. have no international exposure

3. have no bonds or fixed income assets

4. aren't in precious metals to hedge inflation / market downturns

5. have not given your age / time horizon / contribution rate

  
When I see posts like these I get a little afraid inside for the average retail trader. These are risk assets. You have a lot of research to do. What are your goals? Long term growth? Fast money? What's your risk tolerance? What did you do besides look at a S&P map and throw darts? I would suggest DCAing into an index fund or even money market (hell its like 4% right now) and get some core holdings with growth before trying to play roulette Sorry for being snarky and I'm glad you have ""many different"" portfolios. But what did you expect just naming off some randomly weighted S&P duplicate? We don't have a crystal ball. We could dive 20% tomorrow for the next 4 years who tf knows lol. Just pointing out that you should be thinking about broad based diversification and capital preservation instead of chasing giants at all time heights Kinda. A mini all sectors ETF I suppose. Not sure about auto buys, but you can definitely have your bank account that’s connected to your brokerage make scheduled deposits and put in limit orders. Pepsi has some strange ceo dynamics from what I remember recently. Can’t argue those names are giants in the industry. The ones where I calculate the beta to cpi. I use fidelity mostly. Any money in my SPAXX account (which is where your money goes when deposited into fidelity) automatically buys whatever I want pretty much. I set the amount and how often. Every Monday it buys my strategy, I just make sure I have the funds in SPAXX to cover it. so im a little bored on a quiet friday, going back to the 1990, on weeks where the spx is down at least 1.5%, the correlation to gold's returns is 4%. I also did the correlation to the next week's golds returns (so if spx <= -1.5%, the following week how does gold do) and that r\^2 goes up slightly to 9%.  so it doesnt even offer equity drawdown protection, or lookahead protection

what gold is, is very uncorrelated to equities, its essentially a random variable.  so if you take a portfolio of equities with a 16vol (stdev of returns) and add in an uncorrelated asset like gold, you will reduce your portfolio volatility, which by definition increases your risk adjusted returns.

most retail investors dont really care, because they're in the absolute return game, but in the institutional finance world, how much return you get per unit of risk is very important to allocators, so higher risk adjusted returns (even if they're lower absolute returns) is almost always a preferred portfolio.",0,0.5,20,0,JackWagon1990,investing,"['NVDA', 'GOOGL']",rate diversification strategy went huge stock buying spree week pa picked top name nearly sector curious everyones thoughts names picked strategy large amd nvda heavily weighted positions im mostly equal weight everything else heres breakdown port sector 1 app nvda amd owned pltr earlier year sold roughly 100 profit current position 2 energy epd gev 3 consumer discretionary bkng dis 4 comm services googl 5 healthcare lly 6 financials brkb 7 industrials cat 8 consumer staples wm 9 materials mp 10 utilities aep nice thing actually working buy side trusty blp terminal using monthly data 1960 rolling 1y correlation gold core cpi floats 15 15 shockingly static largest positive correlation indicating hedge cpi gold 40 month 1970 2 months 1978 never got 20 youre mistaking data something know true everyone says gold hedge inflation statement marketing designed sell gold old people happening since 70s sad theres value holding physical gold youre diversifying portfolio short term correct premise counterintuitive plan selling alone sectors one position soon sell one youre less diversified across portfolio etf sector none meant snide trying understand learn dont really count diversified since youre still purely exposed equities nothing else equities go go exception maybe healthcare utilities check rolling beta correlations testfolio theres equities bonds crypto real estate managed futures gold true diversification asset classes noncorrelated would also count investing international stocks enough diversification either despite many people saying since theyre also equities follow closely us stocks tip pick top equities diversify assets told countries outside united states take red pill neo realize reality countries see explosion pictures us news actually economies seriousness arent diversified 1 hand picked winners based performance instead buying whole economy line goes forever true isnt whatever think next google wont decades pass 2 international exposure 3 bonds fixed income assets 4 arent precious metals hedge inflation market downturns 5 given age time horizon contribution rate see posts like get little afraid inside average retail trader risk assets lot research goals long term growth fast money whats risk tolerance besides look sp map throw darts would suggest dcaing index fund even money market hell like 4 right get core holdings growth trying play roulette sorry snarky im glad many different portfolios expect naming randomly weighted sp duplicate dont crystal ball could dive 20 tomorrow next 4 years tf knows lol pointing thinking broad based diversification capital preservation instead chasing giants time heights kinda mini sectors etf suppose sure auto buys definitely bank account thats connected brokerage make scheduled deposits put limit orders pepsi strange ceo dynamics remember recently cant argue names giants industry ones calculate beta cpi use fidelity mostly money spaxx account money goes deposited fidelity automatically buys whatever want pretty much set amount often every monday buys strategy make sure funds spaxx cover im little bored quiet friday going back 1990 weeks spx least 15 correlation golds returns 4 also correlation next weeks golds returns spx 15 following week gold r2 goes slightly 9 doesnt even offer equity drawdown protection lookahead protection gold uncorrelated equities essentially random variable take portfolio equities 16vol stdev returns add uncorrelated asset like gold reduce portfolio volatility definition increases risk adjusted returns retail investors dont really care theyre absolute return game institutional finance world much return get per unit risk important allocators higher risk adjusted returns even theyre lower absolute returns almost always preferred portfolio
1lkix5h,2025-06-25,"Is palladium the most asymmetric bet in commodities right now
Hi! Palladium has quietly crashed over 70% from its all-time highs in 2021, and no one seems to care. But:  
  
\- Supply is tight (Russia + South Africa = 75% of global production)  
\- Demand rebounding (auto production recovering, hybrids need palladium)  
\- No easy substitute (platinum still not a full replacement)  
  
Feels like a classic oversold, forgotten metal with asymmetric upside. I'm tracking PALL ETF for long-term exposure. Curious if anyone else is positioning here?

P.S. I've prepared a log chart of palladium relative to the US dollar, I cannot attach it here, but the long-term setup looks very interesting!
I'm not a car expert but I don't think electric cars have catalytic converters Check Goehring & Rosenswatz research. They're making a good argument for why platinum and palladium could be a good opportunity (you already mentioned hybrids).

**Edit:** Here’s a little summary of their argument on palladium (from their Q1 commentary 2025):

* Supply is collapsing: South African mines are unprofitable, recycling has dropped sharply, and a major Canadian palladium mine may close.
* Deficits persist: The market has run a multi-year supply shortfall, totaling over 1.5 million ounces.
* Demand remains strong: Hybrids and stricter emissions rules are increasing palladium loadings per vehicle.
* Investor interest returning: ETF outflows have reversed, and miners are extremely undervalued. I thought platinum was a 1:1 substitute in most industrial uses, such that whichever one is cheaper at the time is the one that is used. Counter-point: If it becomes detrimental to use, people won't use it. Meaning: If the problems in Russia and Africa are so harsh that it drives the price through the roof, people will come up with workarounds, alternate technologies, innovation will spawn alternate paths, and out of economic necessity, palladium will be left behind.  
  
It's a possibility one must consider. There's a reason we don't use whale oil to light our houses at night anymore Tony Stark was able to build this in a cave, with a box of scraps!!! If a hybrid needs palladium, wouldnt an electric? I'm not Tony Stark! Maybe 5 years ago but not anymore. That's a fair point but I'm not a specialist in palladium uses so I have no idea whether that's possible or not. 

Also some times finding the alternate technologies, if they exist and using them in scale is trickier than we might think they are. You can't just flip a switch and use a new / alternate technology. 

Which means that if there's a deficit in palladium, and the price goes up, it won't go down straight away because someone decided to use an alternate technology. Other the supply will have to increase or we'll have to wait and deal with higher prices until we can switch to alternate / new technologies at scale. Which also costs companies money, so most companies will probably stay with what they know and works. 

Unless of course there's a technology where they can switch with no upfront cost... Yes, I agree that for a short term you might be able to make some gains, but you would always be watching it like a hawk and trying to see if the eventual downturn is coming in or not.

1lk8iro,2025-06-25,"Best Large Cap Core ETF with tech bias?
It looks like a SPYG wins over SPY and even QQQ on a risk-adjusted basis (including drawdowns).

Looking to allocate about 20% to de-risk my concentrated single-stock portfolio with an index.

My bias is simply U.S. tech with a bias to AI/infra, but don't mind some sector diversification.

Anyone else use something else?
Tech bias followed by de-risk lolol. 

Just buy QQQM on a weekly basis. Set to auto. Don’t look at charts. Sell when you have something urgent to pay for. Best of luck. SP500 is already incredibly tech heavy, so still SPLG or VOO. If I were to buy a growth fund I like SCHG over those two. It’s also been around a long time, done at least as well as SPYG if not a little better, has the same low expense ratio as SPYG, a couple dozen more holdings, and has a cheaper share price with more assets under management which although likely minuscule in difference, may have a smaller spread and more liquidity. QQQM appears just to be a retail version of QQQ.

Similar to how VOO is a retail version of SPY.

SPYG beats QQQ on a Sharpe ratio basis. You can checkout iShares “quality screen” or even “green” indices as I noticed NVIDIA, Microsoft, etc.. get top billing for 0.15% ER give or take. Also their IOO Global 100 ETF has a bit more big actual tech, though also some value and/obviously international (likely “value” as well) for a 0.20% ER. 

Any large U.S. growth index will have lots of tech, but those % will vary with how well the stocks are doing in the underlying index; namely S&P 500 growth, Russell 1000 growth, subsets of those  .. even a proprietary index usually based on the previous indices and then “screens” like an increasing sales factor getting into “smart beta” products.

Also what is “tech”?  Does US AMZN, China’s BABA, and/or Latin America’s (but also registered in Delaware) MELI tech qualify as they are using analytics on their customer base and probably more automation? If you are buying QQQ buy QQQM. Same fund that’s just cheaper. FELC for sure Trying to de-risk while still staying exposed to the stuff you actually believe in is like walking a tightrpe blindfolded. SPYG’s been solid, yeah, but if your single-stock holdings are already tech-heavy, doubling down might just be hiding concntration risk under a fancier wrapper. A fund like SCHG or DGRO might give you a similar growth tilt without as much correlation if tech takes a breather.

Are you looking for something you can forget about for a few years, or are you planing to actively monitor and shift depending on how your solo tech plays move? Why would'nt you buy SPYG then? Lower fees, mostly same tech exposure, lower drawdown, and higher Sharpe. If you are already all tech.... then consider SPMO.  It will usually has a majority tech, but currently is a bit under 50%.

1lk54co,2025-06-25,"How to find peace with my investment?
I've always been frustrated with active investing. I've beaten myself up for not making best decisions and it got me very depressed and irritated even though I am kinda profitable. I feel like I have never done enough research about the companies. I am constantly anxious about my portfolio. Which stocks should I hold? How should I manage the position? Therefore, I tried to study on various technical analysis trading strategies and try a lot of algo trading strategies so that I can have a fully mechanic system to make decision. Then I found that it is very difficult to beat s&p 500. Even if I can do it I think it's not worth the effort because the excess return is not that much and I can not guarantee that the system will consistently outperform the market so it's still walking on thin ice and still kind of discrteional because I need to make decisions on adjusting the strategy.

So two year ago I decided that I should just buy and hold the stock market index and get rid of all the stress. But I was not satisfied with 8\~10% return and thought that I could leverage my exposure and made use of this opportunity after a bear market in 2022. It worked great until this april. I grew my account from 80k to 800k in two years (included my salary income). My basic strategy is to hold 3\~4x leverage broad market future and will add more if there is a bit of correction (like 2023/12 and 2024/8). I planned to stop at 2M net worth so with 4x leverage it's another (2M/800k-1)/4\*100%=37.5% and I'll be set. This april I blew up my account because I added on the way down and ended up overleveraged and got margin called. I went from 800k to less than 50k and realized that it's not really a sustainable strategy. Well, deep down I knew it's not sustainable but I wanted to make use of this post-2022 bull market cycle to the fullest because I hate investing so much that I want to make money faster and then sit with 5\~8% return for the rest of my life.

After this incident, I return to steady investment and am considering go back to active investing and trading. Currently I just hold SPY, QQQ, and NVDA. But I find that I beat myself up for taking profits too early or not buying more or not buying any other rallying stock like AVGO, AMD, and a ton of others. I get really mad to the point it affects every aspect of my life. Sometimes I think to myself is it really worth it if investing makes me financially successful but ruin my overall life. I am looking for any suggestion. Much appreciated.

PS. I want to clarify that I am not sharing my story to just rant about my tramatized experience but to explain my thought process and show that I've tried many approaches in investing and that I've always tried very very hard to outperform the market. So I think I need more advice on mindset and psychology rather than ""find a strategy"" or ""just buy and hold spy"" kind of stuff. I am still open to this advice but I need more psychological aspect of it.
This is purely a psychology challenge. And it's really just about your own trading/investing risk appetite.

One question you have to ask yourself - if you really want to develop your trading strategies - do you actually spend the time and effort to understand your risk profile. And do you really have the requisite skill and experience to use leverage.

Losing money while trading and investing is normal. And for traders that trade on leverage - the risk of being margin called can happen.

If you plan to go back to using leverage - have you examined why your risk management failed in April? And do you have a plan to address it?

For example - like many active traders who had heavy short volatility exposure in April, I took some large losses. But I understand very well why it happened. So that doesn't deter me from continuing with active trading.

The thing you also have to understand is that there is no such thing as one type of trading strategy - you have to adjust the strategies based on the current market and macro environments.

Also - if your personality is such where you tend to make speculative investing decisions or trade based on ""feelings"" - you may want to be think about whether you are actually just gambling. You sound like you have a gambling problem that's expressing itself through investing.  You know how to invest but love the thrill.  

One thing that can help is to set aside 2-10% of your portfolio as a gambling portfolio.  This should be a seperate account, preferably with a seperate broker.   So you put say $100k in.  $95k goes to the regular boring portfolio.  $5k goes to the gambling portfolio.  With the $5k do what's fun, get the thrill and the excitement.  With the $95k do what's boring and sensible.  The boring and sensible can be with a robo advisor as your investment options are limited.  

Would something like that work for you? Therapy Noone wants to get rich slowly- Warren Buffet Man, in this point if you are actively investing you are doing it fro the rush, if you don't like it and only wish for peace the worst thing to do is to go back. If you can afford not to risk to much don't risk, better to have peace of mind these days. As you have discovered, leverage is great, …. until it isn't.

Take your losses.   Pay attention to what you have learned.

You may be lucky and outguess the market and make great stock picks, and have great timing getting into and out of the market.    The more likely path is what you have experienced.

At some point hopefully you will realize that just because you were ""not satisfied with 8-10% returns"" does not matter.    

Unless I think I am smarter than the rest of the world or know something that the rest of the world does not know or realize, I just buy the whole market via broad based ETFs like VTI/SCHB/ITOT and VXUS/IXUS.

At some point you may find the wisdom and maturity to ""accept what the market gives"".

Spend some effort on determining your optimal asset allocation and the rules for rebalancing.   Then follow them.

Do not change course in the heat of the moment,   Stay the course with the plan you put together during a period of calm reflection, Insane volatility there, cut the leverage may be a good place to start....

1ljrhwt,2025-06-25,"Leveraging my Roth IRA through Lifecycle Investing | Q2 2025
**Today, June 24th 2025**

Welcome to the beginning of my controversial investing journey where I use lifecycle investing to incorporate leverage in my Roth IRA. Currently, I am 27 years old, with $15,000 in my Roth IRA. I’ve bought one LEAP on VTI at a 150 strike when VTI traded at 300 which is essentially 2x exposure at half the cost of the underlying. Yes I understand that the timing of this is less than ideal. I’m currently hedging against the market in my trading account but for the purposes of lifecycle investing, timing doesn’t matter. It’s more so about your time in the market. When it comes to this, I want as little of my opinion as possible. I hesitated to do this for a long time because I know that once I start, I can never stop. The worse case scenario would be starting now and going back to the traditional buy and hold strategy after I lose all my money from a market crash. 

Please see below for the current information regarding the trade. Which I will be updating every quarter (every 3 months).

**What Is Lifecycle Investing?**

Lifecycle investing, by Ayres and Nalebuff, argues that young investors underinvest in stocks because their total lifetime wealth (including future earnings) is much larger than their current savings. Since most young investors have little capital available for investment, but decades of future earnings, they should take on more equity risk early on through either leverage or loans. As you get older and approach your retirement age or if you get closer to your retirement goal, you should gradually reduce risk.

How to do this:

* First estimate total lifetime wealth and calculate your Samuelson Share.
* Use leverage through either margin, leveraged ETFs, or deep-in-the-money LEAPs
* Reduce leverage over time, shifting to an unleveraged equity portfolio then add bonds/real-estate and cash as retirement nears.



**My Roth IRA and Leverage Implementation**

With only $15,000 in my Roth IRA, I can’t afford to buy a SPY LEAP that expires in > 2 years at the 300 strike price. So instead, I’ve bought one LEAP call option on VTI at a strike price of 150. VTI was trading at 300 at the time of purchase. Unfortunately VTI doesn’t offer options that expire >2 years from now but 570 is somewhat close. Just for clarification buying a LEAP at 50% of the underlying cost roughly 50% of the ETF’s trading price, mirroring 2x leverage. Ideally, when I accumulate enough money I actually want to move to micro E-mini futures then E-minis as from an cost standpoint, they actually cost the least as outlined in the book. Also you get the additional benefit of them not expiring (at least in the same way options do). 

**Plan**

* Quarterly Recalculation:

   * Update my present value of future income and recalculate the Samuelson Share.
   * Compare actual equity exposure to the target and roll or adjust LEAP positions to maintain roughly 2x leverage early in my 20s.

1. De-leverage Schedule:

   * Ages 27–30: Maintain 2x leverage.
   * Ages 30–40: Gradually reduce leverage to 1.5x as investments increase.
   * Ages 40-50: Transition to a 1x (unleveraged) total equity allocation.
   * Ages 50–59.5: Begin incorporating bonds/real-estate and cash, shifting toward capital preservation as retirement approaches.



**Risk Management and Contingencies**

* Time decay: I’ll monitor the LEAP’s theta and, if roll-over costs or time decay become excessive, consider swapping into fresh LEAPs or reducing leverage.
* Market extremes: If the cyclically adjusted P/E (CAPE) ratio spikes above historical thresholds, I may temporarily deleverage to 1x-1.5x rather than fully exit equities. Note I am still considering this since the CAPE ratio has technically been above historical thresholds for a long time. I might just reduce to 1.5x leverage max but my age and progress towards my retirement goal will take precedence. 
* Rebalancing frequency: I plan to rebalance quarterly if my leverage deviates by more than 0.5x from its initial goal.



**Summary**

I’m leveraging my Roth IRA with deep in the money VTI LEAPs to emulate a 2x equity exposure, in line with lifecycle investing principles for a 27 year old. Annual recalculations of total lifetime wealth and the Samuelson Share will guide my leverage adjustments. Over the next decade, I’ll taper leverage and ultimately introduce bonds as retirement nears. Theoretically speaking, over at least 30 years I should see higher expected returns relative to buying and holding SPY while systematically reducing my risk during the years close to retirement by shifting it onto my younger years.
[deleted] You know you’ll get flamed for this but I think it’s cool. 

There was once a horror story about a guy doing this but just using margin and he started right before the GFC. 

It’s a many page thread as he slowly loses it all. Often used as a warning to not do this but iirc he went at it again and made a shit ton of money. I’m not familiar with this method but on margin it’s not nearly as risky as some people make it out to be. 

On just margin you only gotta beat out like 4% returns, not so hard over the long term. 

If you maxed to 2x you’d need a 50% drop to get called. Extremely unlikely to happen from a random point in time but possible. 

Leveraging to 1.5x you would  need a historic drop to get called. Why not choose VGT? VTI LEAPS at ATH LMAO. What is the spread like on those? That shit has zero volume. You should stick with QQQ/SPY for options. Unsurprising though considering this post is more GPT garbage. Oh yea, I'm expecting max flame. I'm okay with it though. I want to share the information regardless of it being the reason for me being poor or rich. I don't see a lot of post about people doing it so I want to contribute information (bad or good) VGT is even more expensive than SPY. I was looking into SPYG but it's not as diversified and the options don't go out that far. Additionally bid-ask is really bad. VTI was bad too, but I actually got mid price believe it or not. Yea doing it on margin outright was actually outlined to be the most expensive option (if we're disregarding getting a credit card loan). The next less expensive but reasonable option is LEAPs then the last is futures. Futures grants access to SPAN margin which is treated differently. Also different brokers might give you different margin amounts so it's good to look into which one is feasible. This is all being said with the assumption that you can even buy futures in your broker's IRA. The option stuff is a bit much for me and makes it over complicated at my level. If I could simply use margin in IRA account at like 4% I’d easily go 1.5x. Just would need to beat that 4% and to get called stocks would need to drop 67%.

Cost basis was $108 for NVDA. Of course NVDA has a monopoly for AI hardware, but there's not enough headroom (a 50% price increase would be a $5.4T market cap).

RDDT's narrative is simple - they offer a unique dataset in a sea lacking in human creativity and insight.

HOOD - partly a momentum play, but they have captured a large portion of the retail investor base (especially mid to upper middle class), which is becoming an increasingly dominant force in the markets.

Anyone else selling NVDA for something else?
Insanely dumb, good luck man 👍 so RDDT goes up like 50% in a month and NOW you think its a good time to buy?

But good luck! Lol have fun losing 2x in 5 years isn't an amazing return. you're barely beating SPy after dividends

1ljn59y,2025-06-24,"Theory Question: Strike Price for Maximum Profit on OTM Options
Suppose on Day 0 shares are selling for $100. As a genie, I know that shares will sell for $150 on Day 10.

On Day 0, what is the **strike price** on 10 day DTE options that would **maximize my profit**?

Imagine options with the liquidity of $SPY, and so there is some fair market price.

Is this a question with a single answer, or does it depend on the volatility of the equity and DTE of the option?

Chat GPT thinks you want a strike as close to the final price without going over. That seems too simplistic! Is that true?
ChatGPT isn't correct. Assuming that volatility doesn't change at expiration, normally you would want to be closer atm or even itm if the goal is to hold the contract until day 10. 

And to maximize profit - usually you wouldn't just use a long call position. Usually a synthetic long future would increase profit more than just a long call. ChatGPT is wrong. Your profit would go to zero as the strike approaches the future price.  

You want a strike roughly halfway to the future price. But the exact max depends on IV and other parameters. There is probably a closed-form solution under black scholes but I don't know it. If you’re going to sell right at expiry, we would discount any time premium and only go with intrinsic value.

Your highest profit strike when buying 10DTE calls is above the current price and below the future price. It’s the strike that allows you to pay the minimum amount of extrinsic value (time premium) while giving you significant intrinsic value at expiry.

For very low IV, it’s going to be closer to the $150 strike since the farther OTM calls are going to be DIRT CHEAP, and you’ll be able to load up a ton of calls for a small price.

For high IV, it will be closer to the $100 strike since all the options will be rather expensive and you’ll just want to get intrinsic value.

At $150 strike and $150 market price, your calls are worth $0 so that’s why you don’t want to buy the $150 strike if you want to hold to expiry. The profitable scenario here is when you sell BEFORE expiry when IV skyrockets from the stock movement. >Chat GPT thinks you want a strike as close to the final price without going over. That seems too simplistic! Is that true?

How did you ask chat GPT as this is too simplistic.

Because in theory you could do more then one trade , again in theory disregarding margin you could sell deep ITM puts with some strike price of 150

Then use your cash plus the premium you get for the puts to buy calls  you probably can get more leverage using futures if this is SPX but I really don't understand futures To take it even further you could get more by selling a call at the expiration strike, at which point your p&l is identical to a short put so it seems like writing a put at expiration strike is the real answer. That is a question that is impossible to answer, since *""today's""* price of the option chain depends on a lot of factors, including, but not limited to, volatility and interest rates.

Having said that, if you want to really maximize your profits, you should not look into options that expire in 10 days, but instead look at **liquid** LEAPS, which are priced *relatively* low price, in 10 days **IF** your underlying security is really up 10%, those **liquid** LEAPS might be 2x or 3x or 4x or more.

There are services (paid services) that will let you screen options with different scenarios and also do backward what-if scenarios.

1ljmqk9,2025-06-24,"Summer correction incoming?
Was reading an article today titled “Stock Market Crash:expect another 20% plunge this summer”, can’t post the link but you can google it 

Curious if anyone else is planning on moving to cash in case this happens?  I didnt touch my portfolio during the most recent correction, which is very heavy in VOO and QQQ, and am right back where I started pre liberation day. It’s in my retirement 401k account with another 15 years to go, so I’m not terribly concerned with near term fluctuations, but it would be great to take advantage of another dip to buy more (if I had a sizable cash position). 

Can we keep pushing ATHs, or will there be a sizable correction again?
Thoughts?
Yeah, there's gonna me a summer crash, fall crash, halloween crash, christmas crash, and new year crash. Clouds around here look kinda suspicious so there's probably a crash tomorrow too. man people have been calling for crashes every other minute. I’d take any ‘prediction’ like that with a grain of sand, not even salt! > Summer correction incoming?

Don’t know, don’t care 

> Was reading an article today titled “Stock Market Crash:expect another 20% plunge this summer”

They make those articles like every 6 hours

> Curious if anyone else is planning on moving to cash in case this happens?

No, never. Timing the market is a losing strategy. Only poors move money based on headlines. DCA and hold. I don’t try to time the market because I won’t need the money in my portfolio for at least 20 years.

If it “plunges” 20%, that’ll be fantastic because I’ll get a better deal on the stocks I buy with my automated purchases. Very difficult to predict a correction, let alone one of 20%. Even permabears like Jeremy Grantham and Michael Burry have gone quiet after years of predicting corrections.

\>>It’s in my retirement 401k account with another 15 years to go..

Leave your money invested then. Even if there is a correction, the market will recover and in 15 years time you won't notice. Unless you know something that wall street doesn't, you're much more likely to lose out than gain. > It’s in my retirement 401k account with another 15 years to go, so I’m not terribly concerned with near term fluctuations, but it would be great to take advantage of another dip to buy more

If there's a crash you'll buy it by virtue of the contribution from every paycheck.

That's all ya gotta do here. Most people are likely to fail trying to time the market like this. People have been consistently posting about an upcoming crash as long as I’ve been following this sub (years) and they’re almost never right. Nothing is coming I keep waiting To be blunt, you'd just as likely fuck it up and be uninvested with that $500k when the market jumps 10%.

Yahoo finance will show you which hedge funds hold the stock, under “holders” one you search the ticker. Depends on what the stocks are Depends… Age? Goals? Risk tolerance?

It'll probably be something similar to https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vffvx#portfolio-composition (With different weights). 

If you don't wanna think about things, this is perfectly fine. The allocation will change every year to be less in stocks and more in bonds.

You can change to your equivalent of VOO if you want 100% US stocks, but again, the target date funds are pretty close to a 'perfect' investment for retirement. Thanks. Will check it out. These are the fee.

* Coffee is becoming a commodity, discounts chains are selling coffee at cheap prices and more and more Chinese consumers have coffee machines at home.
* Intense competition from Luckin Coffee on the lower segment of the market.
* Intense competition from premium next-gen coffee chains like SAANCI. Their stores are totally packed in China, while Starbucks is more than half empty.

In my opinion, Starbucks is just moving way too slow to reacted to consumer preferences, local owners can move much faster strategically.

Starbucks is still a high value stock if it can solve its China problems and turn around its business outside of China!

  

you can call it a bullish sign but its not.  Starbucks same store sales are falling since 2022 and the story they sold investors is that the growth in China was gonna offset it.  They got run out of the Chinese market.

Don’t forget teenagers. These days a huge portion of Starbucks’ revenue comes from teenagers and young adults drinking 1,000-calorie cold brew frappuccinos. 

Every new Starbucks location I’ve seen in the last few years was built right next to a high school. On purpose. If you have been to China, especially places in major urban centers, you'll find that the coffee/drink market is ultra-saturated and making money for anyone in that industry is really, really hard.

There are prices that run the full gamut, but there is incredible pressure downwards. There is also ludicrous levels of incredibly novel drinks that I couldn't even imagine 5 years ago that chains like Starbucks can't compete with because the whims of the market shift so fast.

Coffee/Tea/Boba is feels like such an old concept in China. You have all sorts of soy, tofu, fruit, cheese, starches, beans, rice, types of sugar, fermented, etc drinks that never seem to end in the variety, color, price that the market prefers over the old standby items in the rest of the world. Everyone thought china was their saving grace but turns out the chinese market prefers chinese brands. >Don’t forget teenagers. These days a huge portion of Starbucks’ revenue comes from teenagers and young adults drinking 1,000-calorie cold brew frappuccinos.

As a father of a 14 year old, I can confirm the strange devotion my daughter and her friends have to Starbucks. Wow that’s some next level copium. So true, sometimes I just long for a simple boba tea or salty milk cap tea, and it's soo hard to find. Teenagers want sweet dessert type drinks and energy drinks, and all of the new coffee shops are eating Starbucks lunch currently. 7 brew expanded to my area and that’s now the go to teen place, it’s always 2 lanes deep with traffic.

1ljdwok,2025-06-24,"Advice for avoiding a wash sale. Defining ""substantially identical""
I have underwater positions in SOXL I want to sell off and declare the losses against my gains on my taxes.

I've also bought positions in AVGO (Broadcom), NVDA (Nvidia), FNGB (ETF of MegaCap tech companies including Nvidia) and TECL (ETF of MidCap-MegaCap tech companies including Nvidia, Broadcom and other semiconductor companies) within the last 31 days

Will any of those stocks/ETFs be considered ""substantially identical"" to SOXL and void my ability to declare my SOXL losses on my taxes?
No, you'll be fine.

IRS doesn't even consider SPY and VOO substantially identical, never mind a 3x semi ETF vs individual companies or the ETFs you mentioned. Soxl doesn't hold more than like 5-6% of any one stock so you should be fine  Correct.  I doubt anything else exists that would be considered substantially identical to SOXL. To be fair this isn't clearly answered by the IRS. I believe all we know for sure is we've never seen an audit in which this was an issue. I would hope , if the IRS does start to rule  holding etfs that follow the same index as ""Substantially identical"" they would clarify before just dinging people on audits, considering for the past 20 years they have not enforced this on funds that follow the same index.

Maybe that is too much to hope for.

My thought they won't consider them wash sales, because what if two indexes are ALMOST the same. Take the Dow Jones large cap index vs CRSPR large cap vs S&P500

3 different indexes that are going to be ""Almost"" identical , it would be too complex to write a coherent set of rules what clarifies what it means Just so everything is clear, VOO and SPY have \_never\_ been viewed by the IRS as a wash sale, despite literally millions of such transactions. you could buy the underlying ETF to SOXL and it would be substantially different I'd imagine since SOXL uses options and leverage.

So theoretically, I can safely sell off my positions in SOXL now and avoid a wash sale as long as I don't re-buy SOXL specifically in the next 31 days. Thanks for the feedback.

1ljcsj0,2025-06-24,"GOOGL - the perfect GARP play through 2030?
GOOGL is entering bearish territory in the short-term.

Long-term, it remains an attractive GARP stock (17 P/E, 50% EPS growth, 56% gross margin).

Yes, ChatGPT is a competitor to Google Search, but not an existential threat (at least this decade). The market has overreacted to the LLM threat, and hence why it has been trading sideways.

Google's AI team is top-notch - their research laid the foundations for ChatGPT. They are likely able to monetize not only their LLM (Gemini), but also their AI prowess elsewhere.

Remember, Google also owns a wealth of data and the infrastructure (Cloud, TPUs).

GOOGL is the rare megacap tech with margin of safety, optionality, and runway.

Anyone disagree?
I think it’s a strong buy based on the overreaction to LLM alone. 

ChatGPT usage has certainly picked up, but Google has continued to report quarterly growth in overall search volume & ad revenues. Even when/if search volume does decrease a decade from now. Their cloud business, YouTube, Chrome & Waymo would all be worthwhile standalone businesses to invest in. It makes perfect sense on paper but you’ve failed to consider that the market is irrational and hates real companies run by competent people at the moment. If it were a giant scam instead of one of the best companies on Earth it would do much better in this market. YouTube?
Android?
Cloud-based apps?
Waymo?
Voice?
Lens?
Gemini?

Theres are many reasons Google has remained relevant beyond Gmail, Maps, and ads. I hate how accurate this reads Of course not, but that’s the point of this post. Search WILL NOT go to zero. 

The entrant of new viable competitors has been conflated to “Search is dead”.


There’s a whole lot of numbers between the $273B Google reported in Ad revenue only, and $0

Fun fact: even if Google lost all of its search ad revenue. It would still have a lower P/E ratio than Tesla. Biggest problem with google is people not realizing how much they've done since those things. Enough of the post spamming lmao, it's goofy. 

If you believe in the company, buy shares and wait. Simple as that. Google is trading sideways because a decision needs to be made by the Judge in August on how they must restructure their business to comply with violating anti trust laws. One of the extreme rulings would be forced to sell chrome but until it's clear how the final ruling is people are probably not willing to risk it yet.    Long term all else nothing major they will likely continue to be a solid company for another 5-10 years. But never know in tech Yea, but the difference is that when shit starts to go south, google can repurchase its own stock with the money is basically prints, and scam companies go to zero.

1ljahm2,2025-06-24,"SKYE stock - high volatility but vetted by JPM as insane upside
Yesterday I invested in SKYE Bioscience - it's at 3$ right now and top analysts like JPM, Scotia Bank etc think its price target is in the range of 14-21$... literally a 5-7x return. It's spiking like crazy (high volatility, you've been warned) but I think it's got the potential to absolutely soar and return crazy profits.

Thoughts anyone? I got in yesterday at around 2.90$

1) are they doing anything interesting to set themselves apart from competitors? They're working on making a fat loss (weight gain prevention?) drug better. Weight loss and weight gain prevention drugs are hot right now. So seems like a green flag.


2) are they partnered with any big players? Yes, the company they're helping optimize the fat drug with.


3) do they have any contracts coming down the pipe that will bring them money soon? Not really. They're paying out money. Their partner is probably paying them though.


They have various phase 1 and phase 2 drug trials. Those are a dime a dozen, and often take years ro do, get approval, have setbacks, etc.


This company looks like they're another bioscience going throigh the valley of death and hasn't come out the other side yet. Buying them now would get you in early, but it's a bit of a gamble.

1litczu,2025-06-23,"For those who actually invest in physical precious metals…
For people who actually stack physical gold or silver what’s the plan there?
Like are you actually thinking you’ll break off a piece to pay for groceries or something? Not being snarky, just trying to get why you’d hold the metal itself instead of just something that follows the price.
I'm not personally stacking gold at home, but the rationale behind holding physical gold is that it serves as a form of insurance -- you have direct custody of your wealth, independent of third parties. Historically, gold and silver have been used as money for thousands of years, so the theory is that in the event of a severe financial or monetary system collapse, they can help preserve purchasing power.

I don't necessarily subscribe to the extreme ""post-apocalyptic barter economy"" scenario. A more reasonable view is that if fiat currencies were to fail, gold and silver would likely retain their value (judging by thousand years of history). When a new monetary system eventually stabilizes, you'd be able to exchange your gold and silver for whatever the prevailing currency is at that time, effectively preserving your wealth through the transition. It's cool For real. I feel like in a real apocalypse situation, ammunition could become a currency. Independent of whether it makes sense to keep physical gold…

…consider that historically, in times of government or societal collapse, it is *unusual* for there to be widespread violence and anarchy.

Russia in the 90s is probably a better scenario to envision than Somalia. 

Ammunition is not unreasonable if you want to hedge for this scenario. But don’t get caught up in the erroneous assumption that in the case of loss of effective government, the end result will be the purge. 

It’s usually just a boring economic depression.  🤝 In a real apocalyptic scenario anything in the base of Maslow's hierarchy of needs would become a currency (food, water, shelter, clothing, etc) I consider it part of my emergency savings.  I have 6 months of living expenses in cash and about 3 months in gold/silver. I would only sell it as a last resort.  I don't expect it to fund my retirement or grow at the rate of the stock market, but I do hope it will hold its value.

As to why physical, basically just to manage counterparty risk. I love gold. It’s a small part of my net worth (1-2%) and mostly in Swiss francs because if it’s good enough for James Bond it’s good enough for me.  If you have all those things and no bullets, and I have one bullet, then suddenly I have all those things.

1lio5ia,2025-06-23,"What tickers should I add or remove for future growth.
Recently began my investment portfolio in place of my savings account starting at 28yo. Ill be investing 1k monthly.   What tickers should I add or subtract. What percentage would you recommend I split my portfolio. 

My goal is growth and dividends drip reinvestment.

Current
SPY- 8.4%
JEPI- 16.6%
VOO- 25%
SCHD- 25%
VIG- 25%
[deleted] I'd drop JEPI, SCHD, and VIG. Especially if this is a taxable account, but in general really.

VOO and SPY are the same thing, just pick one or the other. 

If you want to be all-in on the US, you could just be all VOO. Don't set fire to your money for no reason.  Get rid of JEPI. Qqqm if you want the Nasdaq 100 exposure. But voo is fine too. You could do worse that your picks, but you can simplify.   
  
Pick a single US equity fund like VOO/VTI, a single international fund like VXUS, and a single bond fund like BND. Swap VTI/VXUS with VT for an all-in one world equity ETF. If you get to higher income swap some BND for munis like MUB to decrease taxation.

Pick the percentages and hold. I do 45% US, 35% international, 20% bonds.  That's it!

Remember, dividends aren't free money, they're just forced capital gains. Don't chase them unless you have preferential tax treatment (eg. you live in Canada, Canadian-source dividends have preferential treatment for low income brackets). This normally isn't the case in the US. Remove JEPI, SCHD, and VIG. SPY and VOO are the same thing. Keep VOO. Add a small cap and an international and you’ll have a fairly diversified portfolio without the performance and tax drag. [removed] Yeah the income funds are better if you come into a ton of money and want to collect dividends as extra income or if you’re retired and want to live off of dividends. But you have a lot of time for investing in more growth. Personally I am tech heavy with FTEC, SMH, and IGV. All his opinions about different funds or whatever 


At your age it doesn't matter. You might have more if you pick one or above the other. But in 30 years or 20 years you're going to have so much money coming from that. It doesn't matter 

If money is your thing then consider other streams of income besides stock market.  And by the way, everyone giving an opinion about what to get is never going to reap or be responsible for the loss of any advice you take. 

If you're that interested to ask people on Reddit, you should be interested enough to be reading a book. Since I am not omniscient I just buy the whole market via VTI and VXUS.

Seriously,  active stock picking mutual funds, with lots of full time researchers, end up on average doing worse than the overall market.

Put some time into figuring out your desired asset allocation —- how much cash (aka emergency fund) and other fixed income vs how much in equities.     

Then the next most profitable investment of your time is trying to improve your ""human capital"" —- your career skills and qualifications.

1lif06l,2025-06-23,"What ETF is both uncorrelated/SPY and Profitable?
I am for a portfolio that is 50% SPY and 5 ETF's of 10% each that are uncorrelated to SPY but also have a chance to profit well.

GOLD has been uncorrelated with SPY and profitable recently.

CTA / commodity futures seem like an option.  

BND / TLT and the like are too darn unprofitable, and to the extent they rely on the credibility of the US government, that does not sweeten the deal these days.

REITs?  the broad general funds seems highly correlated, and the specific ones require superior information and sophistication that most of us ain't got.

 What else?  

Thanks!



   
> TLT and the like are too darn unprofitable, and to the extent they rely on the credibility of the US government, that does not sweeten the deal these days

I think that's a silly take, tbh.

But in any event, this is a good reference for asset class correlations:

https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/asset-class-correlations >GOLD has been uncorrelated with SPY and profitable recently.

Gold/SPY correl just reached it highest in 20ys at the end of march, to 30% (its since fallen back off to about 12%). but its been positively correlated with spy since covid.  you couldn't be more wrong.

  
(1Y rolling correl) > ETF Replay says that TLT is down 3.8% over the past 12 months and down 11.5% in the past 36 months

Of course; interest rates went up. 

I'd suggest reading up on bonds and the inverse relationship between yield and price, as well as interest rate sensitivity. It's important to note that since SPY is usually headed upward, the less correlated an asset is with it, the less profitable that asset will be. 

So usually you're looking for things that are simply less-than-1 correlation, not zero and not negative. And then incorporating them together to create a portfolio with higher risk-adjusted returns. You need to do all of your evaluations on _the portfolio_, not on individual assets. (I like to use https://www.lazyportfolioetf.com/portfolio-backtest-and-simulation/ to do this because it has a lot of historical data available for free.)

When diversifying past US large cap, I would look at: 

* US mid and small caps
* developed economy stocks
* emerging economy stocks
* US bonds (government, corporate, muni) 
* ex-US bonds (hedged and unhedged)
* real estate 
* commodities
* cryptocurrency

The boglehead community is all about diversification, and so you will find easy examples of widely diversified portfolios there (https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio, https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Lazy_portfolios). VXUS is another good option.

I’m personally about 55% VTI/ 12%VXUS/ 33% physical rental real estate. > silly to say TLT is unprofitable, or silly to fear the US government these days?

Both. 

Bond yields are around the highest they've been in decades, TLT is available at a great price, and the world still has faith in US treasuries as the lowest-risk fixed-income investment. But I am missing something then.  ETF Replay says that TLT is down 3.8% over the past 12 months and down 11.5% in the past 36 months.  How is that profitable? Domestically, read where the utility sector is the least correlated with the broad stock market, though they’ll take a hit in a serious recession.  So XLU, FUTY, IDU, etc.. think they are all fairly similar. 

The developed international markets (VEA, IDEV, IEFA) might have started  to become uncorrelated with the U.S. market, as they were from 1950 - ‘00s.   

Emerging markets are a bit new and China has its own schedule so far, so could separate it (FXX, MCHI).  The rest of the emerging market may depend on India’s growth, so separate it out a bit further (EMXC but Vanguard is coming out with their own version).

The Swiss franc is also in play, but Switzerland is becoming more integrated with the EU/NATO due to decades of neighborly economics (not wanting to be too expensive vs the €) .. and now increased geopolitical instability, respectively. I would do

1lhul3c,2025-06-22,"Advice about ethical investing?

So, for context, I’m from Spain and almost 30. I started investing around two years ago, when I didn’t really know how it worked. My biggest investment was my current house, which I bought for around 200,000€, and I’ve also put some money into the stock market sporadically (around 3,000€ total), investing in the classics like Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Coca-Cola, by buying individual stocks through Revolut, not funds or ETFs. 

I never invested in Tesla, Netflix, and some other companies because they go against my values (Elon Musk, subscription services, gas or arms companies, etc.). But over time, I’ve realized that many of the companies I have invested in don’t align with my morals either, especially after some of them publicly supported Trump (Meta, Amazon, etc.) or Israel (Carrefour, McDonald’s, and many more).

Now I’m dealing with an internal conflict. I want to make money, but not by supporting unethical companies. I’ve noticed that a lot of funds and ETFs also include these companies in different proportions, and the ones that don’t often don’t perform well. So it’s hard to find ways to invest that feel both profitable and principled.

I guess my questions are: how do you align your values with your investments? Do you think there’s a middle ground, and if so, how do you find it? Do you have any recommendations for specific companies, funds, or ETFs that are both ethical and profitable? Or would it make more sense to put the money into a high-yield savings account, crypto, gold, or something else?

All feedback is welcome.

>ethical investing

>crypto

Lol. It's literally a zero-sum system similar to a ponzi or pyramid scheme. The underlying asset is just spreadsheet cells that do not produce anything and cannot be used for anything aside from speculation.

You'd honestly be more ethical investing in tesla. Crypto pros are literally just a bunch of little elons, but without any electric cars, which are still an ethically defensive investment.

Personally I just buy broad market ETFs and I focus my financial ethics on my own personal consumption. It’s a market of money, not morals. Nobody gets a medal for ethical investing, they only get money for smart investing. I am progressive politically and I will buy any stock regardless of ethics, I’m just trying to maximize my own gains so I have a chance of retiring someday. I wouldn’t fault anyone for doing otherwise, but we are not even a drop in the bucket here and you’re doing a LOT more damage to yourself than any of these companies by considering ethics in your investment strategy. I think you’d be hard pressed to find a single publicly traded company that you found ethical if you really did your research on them. Just give your money and possessions away.  You need to live like a monk if you want to sleep easy.  If you do anything else you are a horrible hypocrite who will rely on ignorance, stupidity and virtue signalling  offers.  If you want to overoome your ethical barriers, try working for your money. ""What's the harm? We all sell out a little every day.

Might as well be on the winning team..."" Either you don't align, or you take less profit. Any corporation that is successful will have some reason for someone to complain about it. I don't think there's some third position solution where you keep your morals and also get the most profitable results. There's a few ETFs if you search with fun labels like being environmentally friendly, maybe that works for you, you'll have to search for one that matches your criteria.   
  
If you put your money on a HYSA ultimately that is backed by government bonds that help finance the defense budget and such. If you buy crypto some environmentalist will come out of the woodworks to explain how using electricity makes you a bad person. If you buy gold, someone will talk about working conditions in mines, its bloody history, etc. Don't worry about investing ethically.  You're actually hurting the cause as well as yourself by doing so.

Consider a similar scenario.  In South America, almost everyone cheats on their taxes.  Something like 90% of the taxes are uncollected in some places.  Some people will argue that you should pay your taxes if you believe that everyone should pay their taxes.  They will argue that you're a hypocrite if you do not.

No, this is terrible reasoning.  If you pay your taxes and everyone does not, this will do nothing to change the current environment of cheating.  In fact, you'll probably make the cheating worse.  Since you're paying your taxes, the government will have even less incentive to fix the cheating that's going on.

The better solution is to cheat on your taxes just like everyone else.  But with any money you make, you need to donate to politicians who will pass harsher laws against tax cheaters.  This is the way to effect change.

Going back to your original question, the best solution is for you to invest in companies that will make the most money.  Then use the proceeds towards whatever cause you believe in.  So if you believe in the compassionate treatment of animals, make money off your investment in Tyson Chicken.  Then donate your profits to a Congressman who's trying to pass a law to better the treatment of chickens.  This is the best way.

If you don't invest in that unethical but profitable company, you'll be like the person who ends up paying taxes while everyone else doesn't.  You're only perpetuate the cheating of taxes or the mistreatment of animals.

Even if you hate Elon's company, invest in his company if it's the best investment.  (Buying a Tesla is different.  Then, you'd actually be helping him.)  Then donate the money to a fund that will try to get him deported.  😉 >how do you align your values with your investments? 

i don't. i don't know why you would try. the rich are going to get richer, might as well try and pick up some of the crumbs they leave behind. 

you not investing in them changes nothing. i get your sentiment and your intentions but you're only hurting yourself. ""How do you align your values with your investments?""

You don't. If ""ethical investing"" made money it would just be called ""investing."" Now go buy Palantir and Tesla stock. Ethics and trading are mutually inclusive. Impossible to know everything any company does and dig deep enough and likely to find something unethical. Perhaps invest in broader market index based ETFs this way you never know what is or isn’t ethical yet build wealth that later in life can be lived ethically.

1lh2vdf,2025-06-21,"Yelp Might be Undervalued by 15% - 20%
Yelp has been a public company for over a decade now. It makes most of its money from advertising and while it hasn't flourished like Google or Meta, neither has it totally faded. I spent some time digging through the numbers and running  a traditional DCF and here are my thoughts. 

* Yelp generated $1.4 billion in revenues in 2024 but growth has slowed down significantly - to single digits 
* Its operating margins are improving - from 5% in 2022 to over 10% in 2025. In my model, I assume margins continue to rise and eventually settle around 18%. That’s still modest compared to Google (\~32%) and Meta (\~41%).
* Revenue is driven by two key metrics: Ad Clicks and CPCs (cost per click)
* Ad Clicks increased in 2024, but CPCs remained flat. I found that a bit odd, especially since the number of businesses advertising on Yelp has slightly declined. My theory: Yelp is doing some search arbitrage - buying cheap clicks on platforms such as Google/Meta, then reselling that traffic through its own higher-priced sponsored listings. 
* Lastly, Yelp is a controversial company - [South Park once dedicated an entire episode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%27re_Not_Yelping) to mocking it and there's even a Kickstarter-funded documentary called - [Billion Dollar Bully ](https://tubitv.com/movies/520879/billion-dollar-bully) \- that questions its business practices.  Online forums are littered with accusations of pushy sales tactics and pay-to-play schemes. Yelp denies these allegations, and to be fair, has never been reprimanded by the courts. They operate in a tricky area of maintaining a ""fair"" review system, so this kinda backlash isn't totally unexpected. 

Based on my analysis, I think Yelp is worth about $38/share  - with upside scenarios pushing it past $40. It's currently trading at $34/share. 

Would love to hear what ya'll think. Yelp in not a buzzy stock anymore but there might be some hidden value here. 
Do you or anyone you know still use yelp? Fuck yelp, they bully small businesses. Fuck Yelp.

Hopefully Google bankrupts them. occasionally an old lady calls because of our good reviews on yelp.

Back in the day; they started selling rankings and put up ads for my competition RIGHT UNDER MY LISTING.

So fuck them. There is something like 7 billion phone service subscriptions

I'm pretty sure yelp has been dead for years, and I don't see it making a relevant comeback Yelp is cancer. I knew someone who was hired full time to write fake reviews on Yelp. If we are following lynchian principles I haven’t really used yelp in years, nor anyone I know, nor my partner who owns a small business. 

They tried their shady tactics on him as well (basically you pay and the negative reviews get dropped to the bottom…at least that’s what was heavily implied). 

And it is clear every time you open the app you see the same few restaurants promoted to the top that you are just seeing the pay for play businesses. 

Maybe google is just as shady but at least they are more convenient. 

Their business model was predicated on extorting small businesses for good reviews, but that only works when they have dominant market power. Why use them

1lgyxtm,2025-06-21,"Investment Advice for Retirement Accounts
I’m 31M with a 403b through work. They contribute 10% I contribute 5% for a 15% total and I currently have contributions going 100% in FXAIX and it has performed great so far. I also max out my Roth and current allocations are: 50% VTI, 30%QQQM, 10% FEPI, 10% TSLA. Wondering if I should get more aggressive with what I buy in my Roth (like buy more individual stocks) since I already have a solid set up in my 403b (that also overlaps) or if I should just stick the course.
I’d stick with what you’re doing. Also, god damn 10% from your employer, Jesus. Keep that job for sure. Mirror them.  Time is your friend.  Volatility is not.

Slow and steady wins the race.  Don't get FOMO.  If you feel the need to invest in ""hot stocks"" set a couple of grand aside in a brokerage and have at it their.  This way, you scratch that it but still keep building for the future.  I'd even pull the TSLA out of my Roth.  Index funds only. > 10% TSLA.

That's pretty aggressive. Hopefully your cost basis is very low. How long ago did you buy?

> Wondering if I should get more aggressive

Depends on your expertise, analysis of present conditions and the future, and - of course - your tolerance for risk.

> since I already have a solid set up in my 403b (that also overlaps) or if I should just stick the course.

You have to evaluate your holding as a whole, regardless of where they are. That's the starting point. Read the book The Income Factory.  The author uses dividned income to overlaying expenses.  At the author list 68 funds and several example portfolios.  There is also armchair income on you tube.  He list the 38 funds he uses and does detailed review of some of the funds.   Dividends can help retirment funds grow and can be used in any account. Totally get why you’re second-guessing thingswhen your Roth is overlapping with your 403b, it’s easy to feel like you’re just doubling down without really diversifying. And yeah, the temptation to go more aggrssive in the Roth is real, especially since it’s tax-free growth, but chasing individual stocks can backfire fast if you’re not super dialed in. Plus, with TSLA already in the mix, you’ve already got a bit of concntrated risk baked in. What’s been bugging you morefeeling like you’re playing it too safe and missing upside, or worrying that one wrong stock pick could throw off your whole plan? Agreed, got TSLA in 2020 so cost basis is ~$80 but might be time to move on from them I would hold on to TSLA. Definitely missing more upside.

1lfs08m,2025-06-20,"Splitting investments between VOO and SPY
I understand that these are backed by the same assets, have high volume, and market makers will make sure the value stays very close to what it should be.

I also understand that SPY has a bit larger expense ratio but as the percentage of net worth the difference is tiny.  For a $1 mission account that comes to $945 for SPY and $300 for VOO.

My thinking is that the risk that there is some type of fraud is very very close to zero but not zero.

Tell me why it wouldn't make sense to protect myself from that very unlikely scenario if the cost of doing so is so little?

On a $1 million account with half in SPY and half in VOO, the difference in cost vs all being in VOO is a little over $300 on a $1 million account.  I would pay that for a little piece of mind.  (Also, people buy SPY so clearly the cost is not a big factor to many.)

Anyway, I am not trying to convince anyone that I am right.  I presented my thinking so that it can be critiqued.


Lmao, these are funds in the billions.

$1mm is not going to make much difference one way or another. 

Not to mention the companies that are behind the two funds are nowhere near madoff level of fraud.

It really doesn’t make a difference. >My thinking is that the risk that there is some type of fraud is very very close to zero but not zero.

Because that doesn't matter.  If a company does something that would require them shutting down the holdings would just be moved to another brokerage and you still own the same number of shares.  It will just take time for it all to move.  

Most people that buy SPY are doing options so the extra volume is better for them. Yeah, the chance of SSGA *and* Vanguard going bankrupt and committing fraud is also ""very very close to zero but not zero"", so you shouldn't even invest in either one! > Tell me why it wouldn't make sense to protect myself from that very unlikely scenario if the cost of doing so is so little?

Probably best to not start yourself down a rabbit hole of imagined scenarios. What will be next? Because SPY and VOO are ETFs that trade like stocks.

When you’re evaluating stocks, the market cap is important.

And correction, SPY is in billions but VOO is in trillions. I don't know a way that that could ever happen. The risk of getting into an accident *is* high enough that you should wear your seat belt. That's the point, you're taking the reverse of my point. What you posted is *so* unlikely that while it is a ""non zero"" chance, it is not even worth considering. That's why I told you to don't invest in either, because that scenario also has  ""non zero"" chance of happening. There is also risk of a tracking error or other technical error from what I understand. 100% chance your gains are smaller this way. Tiny fraction of a percent chance something goes wrong with one of these funds in a way that actually effects you. If SPY or VOO collapsed from fraud it would take the other down with it. These ETFs are too big to fail, both of them. Spy alone has a market cap of 600 billion, and that is without taking into account the option chains and other derivatives.

1lf7lcl,2025-06-19,"Acquired a UTMA account yesterday at 38 years old- and ~1300% gains
I received a letter from E*trade this week about a brokerage account in mine and my dad’s name and after some research I discovered it was an old UTMA. It took a 5 min phone call for them to transfer the account into my taxable brokerage. 24 shares of Microsoft purchased at $34 now worth $11.5k.

A couple questions:

Will I owe capital gains taxes this year for receiving the account, even if I don’t withdraw?

Should I just leave it in MSFT and let it ride? I don’t follow MSFT and most of my other investing is in ETFs. 

There’s also a couple thousand in cash which I might move into the emergency fund that I’ve been aggressively building or hold for my backdoor Roth conversion in 2026 (both accounts with Fidelity). 
1. No you won’t owe capital gains until you sell the position it’s a normal brokerage account that triggers taxes upon sale.

2. This is up to your goals, and time horizon. Im a CFP as a general rule of thumb I don’t like one position to be more than 10% of invested assets.

3. I think this is a great use of the cash if you are actively building your EF. This is a common misconception.  While it's *legally required* to transfer ownership, the custodian must still initiate the process.  But they are not literally forced to do so.  And if they don't, the account is typically frozen to new contributions and it just sits there.

There are stories of people having real challenges acquiring ownership of a UTMA due to estrangement from (or death of) the custodian.  Looks like OP's firm made the process easy, but that's not always the case. I was initially frustrated that I wasn't given this account years ago, but those shares have grown significantly in the 20+ years they've been sitting there, so in the long run it was for the best. 18 year old me would have cashed out and used what little was in there at the time it to pay for books or something for college. \*flashback to the time I sold some gifted AAPL in 2010 - and crying into my coffee\* At least now I have this nice bump to add to my overall portfolio. It's not much, but every bit helps!

  
Edit: spelling Weird usually those are required to be transferred to your name at 21. So 17 years went by without that happening? Wild You don't owe capital gains taxes until you sell. Probably sell the MSFT as you harvest tax losses in other positions. Thank you for your reply! I have some taxable events this year for other reasons and wanted to ensure I wasn’t adding to that. 

Keeping the MSFT would be <5% of my total portfolio so I guess I’ll keep it there and start following Microsoft. I don’t own many individual stocks outside of NVDA, Google, and a few others, and even they are only a small percentage of total. It was a UTMA there would be no basis change for the death of the custodian. You do owe taxes on the dividends received (technically you should have been paying those the whole time but the income is less than 100 dollars a year so probably not a big deal) > Will I owe capital gains taxes this year for receiving the account,

Gains happen when you start with cash, and sell back to cash.  You haven't sold.  No gains.

>  even if I don’t withdraw?

1lex62f,2025-06-19,"Buying Apple on It’s Decline Versus Minimal NVDA buys
I regularly DCA by virtue of not having thousands to invest at a time (shocker), and have keep buying Apple on its way down. I also have NVDA which I’ve barely bought since its come up so much. Currently around -9% on Apple and in the +20’s% on NVDA. 

Is anyone else doing the same or similar? I’m still not yet 30 fwiw so my timeframes are pretty long. 
This is a pretty limited view, but when I owned Apple people just LOVED to beat on it. It was so massive and profitable and yet the smallest flaw was blown up and advertised everywhere, causing the stock to dip.

“Bad bathrooms.”

“Managers almost never have beards”

“Their glass costs just went up .000001%”

These are all stupid exaggerations, but it’s what I felt like owning them.

But like a few of the magnificent seven, they’re not going anywhere. They could buy their competition. Their competitions boyfriends competition. And all the cousins. 

But their ability to have spectacular growth is maybe gone. It is more gone for Apple than the rest. When’s the next iPhone? iPad. Or gizmo we didn’t know we needed and will put us on perpetual update cycles? AI definitely has its use cases but it’s still a massive buzzword. The fact Apple isn’t so reliant or invested in AI is what I like about them. As a manager with a beard, I approve this message. I pretty much agree with you...but  :) I realized a long time ago that I simply can't tell when a company is through having spectacular growth. 

In the early 90s a friend who worked for Microsoft suggested I take a job there and get some stock options. I literally told him that I thought Microsoft had already made it's ""big money"" with MS Dos and Windows 3, That the next ""Big Thing"" was going to be made by someone else! Lol! Windows 95 showed how wrong I was! Yet after the .com bust it again seemed to me that the ""big growth"" was over for Microsoft...and then came the last decade or so when things shot up.

I figure it's likely the big growth is over for Apple (I mean, they're so damn big already!!!) but I've just been so wrong before! I have heard the same bearish commentary about AAPL for decades now and it has always returned crazy amounts of cash to their investors. Long AAPL They were always following.

First mp3 player?  No.
First smartphone?  No.
First tablet?  No.
First wearable?  No.

What they’ve done consistently is find something that already exists and improve on it.  They’ve also leaned into their ecosystem and made it relatively seamless to shift between their products.

They were also great at marketing/etc.

But they haven’t truly innovated in a LONG time. Microsoft is more Apple than Apple. That is, Microsoft, from its inception, was not an innovator. They took existing products, made them better, and used a ton of monopoly powers to get ppl to buy it.

There was the CEO of quickbooks who kept a shrink wrapped copy of MS Money on his desk to remind him never to fight Microsoft. 

Because there was a sell price of $19.99 and a $20 instant rebate for buying it. This was before subscriptions or add ons or anything like that existed.

*Microsoft would give you a penny to take their software.*

He’s like, how do I compete with that? Is it legal? No. It was just an attempt to put competitors out of business by selling at a loss. They weren’t trying to win, they were trying to make everyone else lose.

So as much good Bill Gates does with philanthropy, he got that money using a monopoly to illegally stifle competition. And I think it ultimately hurt this country a lot by killing innovation. And instead of having one guy worth 115 billion, we might have an extra 100 billionaires or something who would employ **vastly** more than MS.

When he dies, I’ll spit on his grave. And he didn’t in any way hurt me directly. But he was a big education for me that money makes you immune. Sure, you’ll get relief in court. 5 years after you go out of business. And it will have cost them less than trying to compete fairly. Just break the law, who cares.

WHEW! If Apple showed me one thing to really shake up the formula... Or gave me an indicator they would do so, I'd consider accumulating. But they haven't. Glass UI? Really... I'm supposed to be impressed? I like the AR stuff, but their execution is worse than competitors, and even the apple cult thinks it's dead on arrival. They also lost their abusive 30% tax on devs. Where's the upside? When you've captured 90% of the market, there's very little room for growth. Glasses won't be popular until energy storage is ten times denser and lighter. Diversify.  Aapl was great and is still safe IMO.  But you're probably better off in an ETF like qqq, vgt, schg, if you're looking for growth.  Or voo for even more diversification I'm a bit confused of what AI people wanted Apple to use/how it would help them.

he probably gets a fat commission from this ""product selling"" because thats what they do and what it is. What is his commission on this?  I would not do this All securities are not FDIC insured, they are under SIPC which protects the amounts of shares you own not the value of the shares

Many investment products have no downside. The reason they can offer that is they scalp you on fees and take the risk themselves.

It’s not that this advisor is misrepresenting per se, it’s just a way to earn way less than if you took the risk yourself. 

Probably appropriate for someone on the lower end of the wealth scale with a problem to their retirement portfolio if the market falls.

Having said that, I wouldn’t touch it You have a FA and don’t know their fee structure? You have other problems. Sort that first. You do not have an advisor, you have an insurance salesperson.

Nope, never.

better is relative.........

I would find a real advisor. Definitely 100% don’t listen to him. When you said, “from a quick google search”, I suspect you are either joking or, well, joking.

Congrats on retiring! ""Says there's no downside.""

""Also not FDIC insured?""

""Invest 200k into this single company.""

""Take 200k our of your 401k.""

1ldp5hy,2025-06-17,"Recession-Proof Investing Strategy
Other than buying into index funds, what have you all been doing with your portolio to fit the current macroeconomic environment?

Being that we’re in an inflationary period with mounting federal debt, I’m looking for stocks that can be resilient in the event of a crisis within the next 5, 10, 20 years. 

Eventually, I figure the U.S. will need to address the elephant in the room and climb their way out of debt through some mix of decreased spending and tax increases. 

If this is the case, what are you all investing in? Those with limited exposure to government spending (i.e. avoiding defense manufacturers)?  Inflation-proof investments (i.e consumer staples / precious metals)? Companies with limited debt exposure? A mix of all of these? What companies can succeed both in the long-term (regarding the above-mentioned crisis) and short-term (Trump’s new bill)?

Let’s hear it!

65/35 US and international. Own large, mid and small cap. 

Theres nothing you can really do to “shield” your portfolio from a recession in my opinion. Sure, in theory you could perfectly time the top and bottom but in reality you won’t do that so don’t even bother trying.

What you should really focus on is keeping your job. If you keep your job, it doesn’t really matter if the markets fall 50%. Just keep plugging away and you’ll be back within 5 most likely.

I understand that if the market does crash people will get laid off and this advice is irrelevant. I don’t know how to control that other than being good at what you do and getting lucky. Gold, managed futures, and bitcoin in conjunction with QQQ Look up BLNDX

""Recession proof"" is essentially what multi-strat hedge funds are for. Gold is a good investment.

1ld0335,2025-06-16,"Thougts on why Cable One ($CABO) might bounce back up.
Cable One ($CABO) caught my attention after the recent plunge to around $130,  there are several signs that this might be a solid setup for a rebound. Here is some relevant info:

*  Insider buying activity: ""Director Wallace Weitz purchased 7,000 shares of the business's stock in a transaction that occurred on Friday, June 13th. The shares were purchased at an average cost of $132.53 per share, for a total transaction of $927,710.00""

*  The stock has a P/B ratio around 0.44 and analyst recently shifted their thoughts from under perform to neutral.

* Technically oversold: RSI was far into oversold territory, resting on a key support at 52 week bottoms.

* New broadband products: Through its subsidiary Sparklight, they launched “FlexConnect” and “InternetLift”. On the other hand they extended their fiber partnerships with Nextlink, MBI and Clearwave, positively positioning CABO in the broadband market , especially in underserved areas. At the same time, they are moving away from the declining voice and video market to focus on the growing broadband industry.

* Capital allocation: The recent suspension of their quarterly cash dividend, though potentially unpopular with some investors in the short term, is a strategic move to accelerate debt repayment and invest in organic growth initiatives. This can strengthen their financial position, improve access to capital markets, and allow for more aggressive fiber build-outs

*  Finances remain healthy: Nearly $1B in dormant credit lines, manageable debt.

* B2B expansion: Residential customers are down but CABO business data segment grew +1.2% YoY.



Maybe not in the short term, but in my opinion, the stock has potential.






I wouldn't put any value on the stated P/B ratio of a cable company. Good luck finding buyers for warehouses full of cable boxes. I can't remember the last time I was at a house who had cable; feels like something from the past. Stock Price will not see a significant jump unless it's been acquired.

As title says, is anyone who actually beat the market from last 10 years without any etf?

If yes then how your portfolio looked like in those 10 years? 
(I mean what was your tickers in the portfolio). 

I’m 30 years old and earn about $150k per year. 

Thinking to go all in stocks. I do have only 1 etf (VOO) and currently holding following companies for next 10 years:- Google, Uber, Amazon, Nvidia, Intel, ASML, UPS, TGT, ENPH, DVN, UNH. 

If I choose to sell my etf (around $40k) where should I put that money to? (Get the current holdings bigger or add few more tickers in portfolio?)

All your thoughts will be appreciated.
Right back into an ETF.

You're asking if anyone has actually beat the market directly and indirectly asking if you'd be better off in an ETF over individual stocks.

I'll yell ya one thing. It's highly unlikely anyone who isn't sure what to invest in has a chance at beating the market.

It's your money. Do what ya like, but you're probably better holding a low-cost, index based fund The only time I was a “genius” “beating the market” was in the post Covid rally where a chicken could have made money on trades

I tried actively trading and doing the wheel strategy and such several years before and after that Covid bubble and it is never as profitable than my separate account that is only in ETFs [deleted] You are not going to hear from anyone who has been doing it for at least 10 years. What you will hear is from people who started during covid and got lucky. Shit, if you started exactly at the lows of 2022 and threw everything into big tech, you'd be up a lot and think you're a genius.

Your post history shows that you just recently started, even the deleted posts. You said you have no ETFs but you hold VOO. You lost big picking stocks, but now you're thinking of going all in with stocks. You're just throwing crap at the wall and hoping something sticks. Stock picking is what drove me into etfs. Nothing like being held hostage by a stock. 21% CAGR over nearly 22 years. Only own one ETF, a 2% allocation to India, as I can't easily get that exposure directly.

It's not hard, but it does require work. If you're not passionate about finding and tracking a niche, and doing deep financial research on potential investments, passive index trackers are a better approach. Yeah his portfolio size is anything from 1 million to 20 million

1ladgw1,2025-06-13,"S&P 500 premium is mostly warranted says BofA
Bank of America analysts argued in a note Friday that the S&P 500’s valuation premium is “mostly warranted,” despite the index appearing expensive by traditional measures.

“The S&P 500 now trades at 21x forward earnings, 35% above average,” BofA wrote, adding that it “looks statistically expensive relative to its own history on all 20 of the valuation metrics we track.”

However, the analysts say comparisons to historical averages may be misleading.

“Today’s S&P is apples vs. prior decades’ oranges,” they said, noting a shift in sector composition.

“Nearly 70% of the index was asset-intensive Manufacturing sectors in 1980 vs. <20% today.”

They argue the index “has become higher quality, with lower leverage, lower earnings volatility, and higher margins.”

BofA also defended the U.S. market’s premium over global peers. “The US trades as the most expensive region (\~40% premium vs. Europe/Asia which trade at 16x),” they noted, but emphasized that “quality, balance sheets, growth potential and risk are statistically superior.”

They pointed to the U.S. being “half as levered as other regions” and praised “significantly lower estimate dispersion on 2025/2026 forecasts.”

Additionally, the U.S. offers “roughly double the long-term growth potential of Asia and Europe, with lower earnings volatility than Europe, plus higher free cash flow per share and a lower percentage of non-earners vs. both Asia and Europe,” says the bank.

BofA also cited structural advantages including “labor fungibility, USD as reserve currency, energy independence, unparalleled liquidity and Tech primacy (at least for now).”

GOOGL, MSFT, NEE, META, BGM, and FCX may benefit from the S&P 500’s sector shift toward higher-quality, capital-light companies, especially in tech, renewables, and metals.

For near-term positioning, BofA’s tactical model prefers U.S. “Communication Services, Utilities and Tech,” and highlights “Interactive Media & Services, Metals & Mining and Independent Power & Renewable Electricity Producers” as top industry opportunities.
Translation: they are selling. >They argue the index “has become higher quality...

Number 7 on the S&P 500 list is Meta, which gets a large part of its revenue from advertising fraud.  

Number 10 is Tesla. The things they are saying aren't untrue.

People have an intrinsic mistrust of banks but with the decline of manufacturing and industrial, the US has largely moved up the value chain to do high value added work provided by highly educated labour instead of blue collar work.

Despite you know who's effort, the high margin side of the economy is relatively unaffected.

If not Google, who else? If not Microsoft, who else? If not Apple, who else?

Europe has no answer. China has no answer. And in the 1980s those would have been the insanely capital intensive, low margin rotting carcasses of GM, Ford and IBM instead.

In 1980 in fact, 5 of the top 7 revenue companies in US were just oil companies pushing a global commodity dependent on a pricing structure out of their own control. The other two were GM and Ford who didn't innovate , had high costs low margins, and were about to get smoked by global competition over the next 3 decades. No they want you to buy through Merrill. Intellectual property is much much much more valuable than plant and equipment in today's world.

That's mainly the point of the whole analysis.

The factories of GM, Ford, and Chrysler did nothing to create a moat for their products, which were soon swamped by lower production costs and higher quality products produced elsewhere. 

Despite not really having their own major factories, the IP and brands of Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft have deep and wide moats. And they can deploy their profits into more R&D and new products rather than maintain and replace aging infrastructure.

Foreign currency risk is a thing. Yeah, as a UK investor I dialled my USD exposure right back in Feb, when it became clear DT was serious about his devaluation mission. 

It means Reddit is basically unusable for stocks because it's all Americans investing domestically so currency risk doesn't matter to them. 

But for us foreigners, US equities look pretty unattractive even if they are nominally going up. I think some people (specially OP) are missing the point here: if you swap an ETF with another one with the same holdings but trading in a different currency, your exposure is still exactly the same. If you don’t want exposure to USD, don’t buy American companies. Go something like VEU or something.

If your 10 American stocks stay the same in value but the EURUSD gets 50% worse in EUR terms, your ETF will halve in value even though the companies remained the same value (in USD terms). Thing is you are buying cheaper now.  Currency fluctuates. Long term won't matter that much. I don't, I work in asset management so I know what is actually happening.

\-stocks, options, etc

\-margin, at least 2x, and will let it ride overnight like regular margin accounts

\-ideally access to funds

\-good reporting and ui. 

\-fractional share buying. 

  
The thing I love about Fidelity is that you can buy shares with as little as a $1. But with Interactive Brokers Pro, you are paying a steep fee for that. I don't think ToS/CS has this feature. I also love how Fidelity shows you the buy price of each purchase, as well as their Profit/Loss. Trying to trade options on Fidelity has to be the worst experience I've ever had. Absolute garbage. Thinkorswim is smooth, but IBKR Pro offers so much power and options. 

  
I want to open weekly covered call positions on Snap/CMG/WRBY using 2x margin. This is what I will mostly be doing. I typically beat the market when I only trade stocks. I significantly underperform when I trade options or futures, mostly due to greed.

I want to trade index options like NDX/SPX, as well as other stuff like qqq, nvda, cmg, etc

I don't do much futures trading but I do want to be able to buy futures, and futures options.

And I want to be able to buy overnight, if not 24 hours. Tos/CS does not offer this which sucks.

  

Margin is not available in a Roth account - the IRS does not permit loans in an IRA. But you can get limited margin which allows for use of unsettled cash.

If you want to leverage in a Roth - you would either need to use a leverage fund or trade futures. Or trade options since options are non-marginable securities.

As for brokers - Schwab, Ibkr, etc. can be good for active trading in an IRA type account. Some brokers like Tastytrade, Tradestation can also be good depending on your planned used of options and/or futures.

If you are worried about having the ability to actively trade fractional shares - you may want to reconsider your plan to actively trade in a Roth.

It's kinda odd to have a requirement to be able to trade SPX/NDX and then worry about fractional shares.

>want to be able to buy overnight, if not 24 hours. Tos/CS does not offer this which sucks.

That is untrue - Schwab supports futures in an IRA. Although it's limited set of products. If you want access to more CME products - you have to look at someone like Ibkr and/or Tasty. Schwab also supports overnight trading on quite a few stocks that have liquidity.

If you want to trade CBOE index products in GTH session - the only retail broker that I'm aware that supports it is Ibkr. But Schwab supports normal session just fine. But these products are not leverage efficient in an IRA account.

I assume you understand the risks of using leverage. It's not for everyone and can blow up accounts. ToS has 24/5 trading on 800 tickers. If you're selling CCs who cares about fractional shares or extended hours? TDA was one of the first brokers to offer 24/5 trading back in 2018.

1l9ex0t,2025-06-12,"My portfolio companies with reasons
Google:- Search Engine Leader, Google controls over 90% of the global search engine market. I’m a Shopify store owner and I can’t sell anything without Google (there are millions other merchants like me in this globe who can’t survive without Google)

UPS:- Global leader in logistics and parcel delivery and  a solid dividend yield (~4–5% as of 2025). As an online retailer I use UPS over any other shipping company for my business. Why? Fair pricing and great customer service.

TGT:- A Dividend King: Has raised dividends for over 50 consecutive years and also strong partnerships (e.g., with Disney, Ulta Beauty) help attract traffic and broaden offerings.

Enphase:- Enphase is the global leader in micro-inverters. Long-term demand for solar + battery storage is expected to grow rapidly.

UNH:- You all know about this. It’s a top-tier defensive growth stock.

Uber:- It’s a high-growth, tech-forward transportation and logistics bet. Unlike the more mature, stable companies like UNH or UPS, Uber is still in a scaling and profitability expansion phase, but with some strong strategic advantages.

INTC:- This can be very good turn around play. it still holds strategic value and still dominates in PC and server CPU markets, especially among enterprise buyers. Where I work they all use Intel and no way they going to change to other companies anytime soon. 

DVN:- A good dividend play. In strong oil markets, this leads to yields as high as 8–10%, sometimes even higher. Great fundamentals and way undervalued as of today. 



You are welcome to criticise my holdings (and also share what you are holding at this stage)

Good list, I’d say amd is there as a good value rn too. As a doctor I can’t in good conscience buy UNH despite it being an attractive price rn. I'm not sure when you got into some of these stocks

UNH TGT INTC ENPH

But these are real stinkers. We are talking almost at 52 week lows. 

If you bought them for a turn around play you should mention that (I know you mentioned it on INTC but not the others). It's quite interesting because almost all the stocks you have in your portfolio now are a ""Buy the dip"" scenario. Where you have bought them on weakness and they are underperforming the market. 

I'm not too sure how they'll perform over the next year. As you know come back stories can lead to amazing gains, like you have seen with Meta. But I am surprised you don't own SHOP given you yourself said you were a shopify store owner. 

You mention you can't sell anything without Google but I bet you anything you also can't sell anything without Shopify lol. Googles search engine lead is getting destroyed rapidly by AI. Why try to filter through SEO trash Google results when you can ask ChatGPT and have it do that for you?
When AI assistants become better nobody will go to search anymore. Just ask your AI to do it.
Google will also try to compete in that space (and they're good at it) but the ad dollars will shrink by a lot over the next few years I think.

On the other hand I think Waymo is very likely to win the self-driving car race which may have more of a moat and will likely be profitable. It's a bit slow going though, city by city. UNH isn't a defensive growth stock it's now a turnaround story. Scandals in leadership, dirty business, Medicare fraud, etc.

I worry that INTC is dead money and there are so many other ways to invest in semiconductors and the AI trend. I personally would not invest in NVDA but there are other chip companies, ASML, etc. Don't forget that semiconductors have historically been a very cyclical and boom-or-bust business. I think this is a hard place to invest in with a ""set it and forget it"" investment.

I think tech stocks are hard to pick for these reasons so I invest in QQQ. If I had to pick a few tech stocks I'd pick AMZN just because it is not constrained by any one industry or product, GOOG because I think it is the cheapest of all tech stocks. Uber will be affected by robotaxis and it isn't clear to me that they'll be a leader in that.

For renewable power I prefer to invest in the renewable power generators themselves like BEP. I’m referring to Brookfield Renewable BEP? Are they even making money since their startup? Google ain’t make money on searches like how big is Mia khalifa’s tits. It makes money from real merchants. Chatgpt good for getting information. I buy everything just last month. 

Will you share your tickers? I also find the UBER holding quite interesting too because it's close to ATH which is a different play than your other holdings. I don't dislike it.

1l8vmj3,2025-06-11,"Investing in AI: which is the best path?
Hi investing-savvy people. If you could invest in an AI platform, which would you go for? Would you stick to public markets or try to grab something through private equity? For example OpenAI isn’t public, and neither is Anthropic.
Is this a classic situation where we buy the guy selling shovels (e.g. Nvidia, Digital Realty), the scale behemoths (Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta), or look for entry to unlisted companies? From an infrastructure perspective, you would need to gain access to the big funds that are clamoring to buy up DCs. 
I am not looking for advice: I am looking to understand the factors and risks that people assessing to value the sector. 

Happy to enter a conversation rather than simple yes/no interactions.
It's impossible to invest in companies working on actual AI without valuations being overly inflated by the ""LLM chatbots being marketed as AI"" bubble. I was making a flippant comment deriding the state of the ""AI"" investing space, but sure, I'll play.

""AI"" as a field of scientific research includes LLMs, absolutely. Chatbots are definitely *within* that scientific field.

However ""chatbots are AI"" is not something a person working in this field would say in good faith. It's deliberately deceptive marketing speak designed to confuse consumers about what chatbots are actually doing and actually capable of.

LLM chatbots are incapable of logical inference, actually performing math, etc, although they are designed with a lot of workarounds and hard-coding to gloss over this and deceive the user. No amount of probabilistic language training is going to produce an LLM capable of this type of thinking.

Terms like ""hallucination"" are deployed to pretend a different *type* of thinking occurred when the output is obviously incorrect to a human, so we can imagine ""reducing hallucinations"" as something that can be done to make the output always satisfactory. Total circular reasoning.

Right now I'm dealing with junior engineers who are absolutely convinced that chatGPT can do structural engineering if they just ""prompt"" it right. We actually *are* using machine learning in other parts of the team, developing our own models. But we aren't feeding it to a chatbot to garbled the inputs given to the non-LLM model, or allowing one to garbled the results on the way out. It's a design search space tool. If we were shadier, maybe we would package it inside an LLM and market it as a ""structural analysis AI"". 

The scientific accomplishments of the larger field are irrelevant, this is an investing question. Of the companies available to invest in, whose valuation isn't driven by this deception? [removed] I think AI has the potential to be as impactful as the internet was and shows a lot of parralels to the dotcom bubble. A lot of companies raised capital to lay fiber all across the US that is still unused to this day.

In terms of compute.  The supply chain is currently very narrow.  ASML sells lithography machines to TSMC, and generally Samsung/Hynix provide the memory.  Nvidia/AMD engineer the plans to give to TSMC.

Then you have the actual models.   These are trained by a handful of different software companies,  some of them are proprietary,  others are open source but there are a lot of different companies making models,  that more or less are all very equivalent.

Many of the models require a ton of memory to actually process.   Here is our second class of hardware,  inference.   This is less intensive than training,  but has a lot more competition as general purpose graphics cards (provided by Nvidia/AMD) may not be the most efficient hardware long term for running the models. 

This transitions towards data centers next.   Due to requiring a lot of processing that can not be done locally,  the actual computation is farmed out to data centers.  Think Amazon AWS,  Microsoft Azure,  Google Cloud,  among others.

Lastly,  data centers require a lot of electricity to operate.  Not only do the componants draw a considerable amount of energy.

Let's transition back to the internet example, AI allows you to access huge amounts of information in a fast and simple way.  It's very cool, exciting, and improving rapidly,  but it's hard to imagine most of these companies are going to be around in 10 years.   OpenAI which has a lead of marketshare/users for AI,  lost 2.25 dollars for every dollar it earned in 2024.  None of these companies know how to monetize this platform but seem to live on hopes and prayers that they are able to be the Amazon of Google survivors of the bubble. I'm trying to buy shares of SandboxAQ. It's still private.    
  

[https://www.sandboxaq.com/company/leadership/eric-schmidt](https://www.sandboxaq.com/company/leadership/eric-schmidt) Some of it all: individual companies, indexes, hardware producers, software producers, etc. I put 10% of my port into AIQU ETF. But make no mistake, it's pure gambling. Invest in the companies that are smart enough to keep their developers instead of trying to replace them. Fair, but LLMs are *extremely limited* in what they can't and can't do. Saying ""AI"" to people does indeed make them think it's something actually intelligent, able to think and reason.


LLMs don't. They don't reason, they struggle with basic grade school maths and can't tell you how many ""n"" there is in bananas. They'll suggest you add toxic ingredients to a home made bread and will tell pregnant women to eat actually harmful substances (ChatGPT, Google AI).



LLMs have some purpose but it isn't the general intelligence people want to believe it is. Thus the massive hype and many failed attempts to use it as something ""intelligent"" when in practice it's closer to predictive text. Googles search AI is the worst offender but any LLM will do fine. Lie like a bandit, double down and pretend you the one with intelligence is the lens who's wrong. Because they litterary can't think, or reason. Their intelligence is per definition dumb. And their use, is thus, limited. Amazon is a great example of a company that survived the dotcom bubble.   Pets.com is a example of a company that didn't.  Pets.com first round of investment,  came from amazon itself.  Chewy has a succesful business with a very similar business model.

1l6x43w,2025-06-09,"Roth Picks? Starting a Roth IRA at 51 yrs (already 401 and other passive inc investments), target in 5-10 years.
Which stocks would be considered good choices for a Roth IRA over 10 years?

So am almost 51. Have a rental that generates passive income and also a 401k around half a million currently. I might retire early or not depending on how things look but likely work for another 5-9 years.  So want to push a bit in a few areas between taxable brokerage and also the Roth tax friendly accounts.

I may not need to tap the Roth IRA for a good 10+ years, but for now assume a 5-10 year outlook. So I have a few ideas of where to go on the taxable brokerage (VOO, VONG, SPYG, VTI, etc.). But trying to see for the tax friendly Roth IRA (and maybe review my 401k's roth distribution as well)... I wonder what would be good Roth picks going forward?
> As you’re over 50, you can invest 7k per year into the account. 

As can anyone under 50. Over 50, you can invest 8k per year into a ROTH. VOO mitigates risk as it mirrors the market and most investors find it hard to consistently beat the market. Unless you got a better investment in mind it should be your default choice. If you do get an idea on what indicator stock you want to invest in, sell some VOO and buy what you want. 

Also, keep in mind the traditional model is that the percentage of bonds in your portfolio should be equal to your age. You can tweak it by 10% or 20% if you’re more risk tolerant but you need to factor that into your planning. At some point soon your 401k needs to be a target fund or you change the allocations. Speak to your 401k advisor on the best path. 

PS - Asking reddit for stock picks is dangerous. Its like when my uncle asks the guys at the donut shop for medical advice. Can't answer without telling us how aggressive you want to be.  You could do a TDF for 2035/2040, 100% VT with no bonds, or a [3 fund portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio) with your preferred allocation.  Nobody here can answer without more info. I know I will be crucified for saying this, but here goes. You’ve done a great job on your 401(k) and it is likely standard ETF and mutual funds. Let it grow. It’ll probably double up by the time you retire. A small tax advantage account would be a good vehicle for trading and for more volatile assets. I’m not talking about daytrading, but I’m talking about catching trends and letting it go for six months a year or 18 months. Throw a percentage in a bitcoin ETF. Keep most of it in growth ETFs. Throw some in a REIT or high dividend fund. You can buy and sell in these accounts without any taxes. Like I said, let the conservative 401(k) do its thing. A taxable brokerage should not be buying and selling and creating tax events. At this stage in the game, one of the major advantage of a traditional or roth is that they don’t create taxable gains on transactions and you are not locked into the vanilla offerings of a 401k. I hear you about asking on stock picks but I am hoping to understand the trend to narrow down the key list from a vast analysis paralysis of a barrel full of tickers. 

I’ll do my further research on it, but at least I can see something called voo is mentioned a lot and worth understanding more (as an example). 

And yeah people also scream about yield max and msty to be fair. But again a little research will show the red flags as well. Good point on the cap, since I file married jointly that should be higher so I am currently under but it might be something I need to be mindful of. 

Also running some scenarios, I would take out from standard deductions, and let the Roth grow more over time. Once the SS hits at 62+. I would probably go into higher tax brackets. So the Roth would help then. If so the Roth allocations would probably best to leave alone for 15 years+ when I want more flexibility to pull from standard and Roth allocations on keeping the taxable bracket lower (at 62 or higher once SS adds to taxable income)


I noticed voo has been rock solid but is now around 500. I wonder if something like vong has more runway for growth or similar ones with a 5yr higher growth but under 500 if that makes sense. Generally speaking, it would make sense to choose the same things as you are already doing in your other tax-advantaged retirement accounts. 

If you'd like an in-depth look at the overall subject, https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax-efficient_fund_placement is good. 

The IRA limits are low enough that you're not going to end up with that much of your portfolio there, so I wouldn’t sweat getting the details exact. > maybe review my 401k's roth distribution

...what?

On one hand I'd say just do the same as your 401k, and potentially 5 years out now would be the time to think about de-risking.

If you have kids or anyone you'd potentially be leaving things to as a beneficiary, the Roth and a taxable brokerage are the best to inherit. That's something to think about as far as which accounts you tap into, and in what order. 1. Roth has a salary cap of 150k. If you make more than 160k Roth may not be an option any more. 

2. As you’re over 50, you can invest 7k per year into the account. 

3. Unless you know that you want to invest in certain stocks, stick to VOO or other equivalent index funds. Correct.

1l6r1hn,2025-06-09,"Why I Believe Sweetgreen is Undervalued
Why I Believe Sweetgreen is Undervalued: A Long-Term Investor’s Perspective

Since February 21st, 2023, I’ve been steadily accumulating shares of Sweetgreen. My first buy was 106 shares at $9.38, and I currently own 3,194.055 shares at an average cost basis of $23.66—about $9.61 higher than the current share price. Despite the recent underperformance, I believe Sweetgreen is significantly undervalued relative to where it's headed over the next 5–10 years. Here's my breakdown of the current state of the business, and why I remain bullish.

# What’s Going Well

1. Loyalty Program Momentum  
Sweetgreen recently launched a revamped rewards program that gives customers 10 points for every $1 spent. They're adding 20,000 new members weekly, which gives them the ability to run targeted promotions by customer segment and at the individual level—an approach proven by other fast-casual chains to lift same-store sales and overall revenue.

2. Infinite Kitchen Expansion  
The company plans to open 40 new locations in 2025, with at least 20 using Infinite Kitchen automation and one debuting their first drive-thru format. This technology significantly improves:

* Order throughput
* Accuracy
* Labor efficiency

Early results are compelling:

* Over 700 basis points of margin improvement from labor savings
* An additional 100 basis points in improved cost of goods sold
* The first Infinite Kitchen posted a 26% restaurant-level margin, far above the company-wide average of 20.4%

As more locations convert to this model, margins should continue to expand meaningfully.

3. Well-Positioned Demographic Focus  
Sweetgreen’s core audience—Millennials and Gen Z—comprise 43% of the U.S. population and strongly value health, sustainability, and transparency in food sourcing. This positions Sweetgreen to continue capturing mindshare and loyalty among younger consumers.

4. Resilient Revenue Growth Despite Headwinds  
Even amid wildfires in California (a key region for Sweetgreen), reduced marketing spend, and seasonal menu changes, revenue growth remains strong at 15%+. That level of top-line expansion, in this macro environment, is a testament to the brand’s underlying demand.

# What’s Not Going So Well

1. Same-Store Sales Dip  
Same-store sales fell 3.1% in Q1 2025, marking their first negative quarter since the 2021 IPO. This is a valid concern—particularly as the company relies heavily on new store openings to drive growth. However, several short-term factors likely contributed:

* A transitional period as the new loyalty program rolled out
* California wildfires
* Reduced marketing and seasonal menu availability

If these headwinds normalize, I expect a return to positive same-store sales in the second half of the year.

2. Portion Size Perception  
Anecdotally, a recurring customer complaint across social channels and reviews is that Sweetgreen’s portion sizes feel small relative to the high prices. The price-per-calorie tends to be lower than competitors, which could hurt repeat visits over time.

That said, the Infinite Kitchen’s automated portioning should resolve this issue by delivering consistency and transparency in every order. It’s surprising more fast-casual chains haven’t adopted smart measuring tools for proteins and toppings to ensure fairness across staff and shifts.

# Long-Term Outlook & Valuation

For long-term investors, Sweetgreen is not just a growth story—it’s a compelling valuation play.

* The company trades at just 2.1x EV/FY2025 revenue,
* Less than half of Chipotle’s valuation, and
* Well below Cava and McDonald’s, despite similar challenges around same-store sales.

Based on guidance, Sweetgreen expects to end FY2025 with 286 locations. At current levels, the business trades at $5.5 million in enterprise value per store.

Compare that to:

* Chipotle: \~$65.6 billion EV / 4,056 stores = $16.2 million EV/store

This gap is stark—and, in my view, unjustified. Yes, Sweetgreen stores are underperforming right now, but the top-line pressure is industry-wide and likely temporary. Meanwhile, margin improvements via Infinite Kitchens could structurally enhance profitability over time.

If Sweetgreen can:

* Drive increased customer frequency through its loyalty platform
* Solve portion perception issues with automation
* Expand into higher-volume drive-thru real estate
* Launch higher-margin menu innovations (e.g., handhelds, kombucha, add-ons)

…then I believe the company has the potential to 10x in value over the next decade. That implies an $18–20 billion market cap, which would still be modest compared to Chipotle (\~$70B) and within reach given its trajectory.

Disclosure:  
I am currently long Sweetgreen with approximately 3,100 shares and October 2024 call options.
Counterpoint: it’s not that good Tough bet valuing that as the “ next Chipolte “, I think Cava has that mantle and even then it’s extremely difficult to get there. But I do like their food and think the kitchen idea is very clever and smart for the future. Good luck with this one! Many small cap companies are undervalued right now

1l6ppx8,2025-06-08,"Recommendation for a google sheets Stock tracker and comparable?
I know there a ton of youtubie type videos out there...but anyone have a good stock tracker for watchlist purposes? Bonus if it helps track portfolios and dividends as well (Stock Growth + Earnings based on transaction).

I use notepad and a basic googlesheets to scribble down notable stocks (P/Es, industries, etc., 1yr vs 5 yr vs YTD differences) that catch my eye but its a big mess. And I want to clean it up to make it a bit more easier.

Any recommendations for a google sheets template to make a copy with? Or what do you guys use if your willing to share.
Finviz can store a portfolio and show 5 year annualized return.  Save your portfolio at [https://finviz.com/portfolio.ash](https://finviz.com/portfolio.ash), then click open in screener and you get tons of options include 5 year return under valuation.  

Also AI can do much of what you're asking.  

eg https://x.com/i/grok?

>I'm looking for stocks to buy in the utilities sector.  Show the ones with the highest 5 year gains in a table.  List the current YTD performance, PE, EPS, 5yr performance.

Here are the results:  [https://x.com/i/grok/share/X3Mc3huwK98m5NGjpmfMfNyFC](https://x.com/i/grok/share/X3Mc3huwK98m5NGjpmfMfNyFC)

It shows VST #1 at 252 non-annualized %, CEG at #2 at 77.5%, etc...

You can try it free [airith.com](http://airith.com) and generate a CSV or a visual plot like I have. Note: Self promotion Thank you for the tips! why use a stock tracker when you can use online ones?

to have less info cause curated is better? You can use this free google sheet to track portfolio value, sector split, monthly performance vs. benchmark, P&L per holding, etc: [https://themeasureofaplan.com/investment-portfolio-tracker/](https://themeasureofaplan.com/investment-portfolio-tracker/) Too much time finding a watchlist site that has what am looking for instead of 60% of it in one view.

When I can do google sheets and have custom columns to show for example, YTD, 1YR, 5YR, Industry/Sector, etc. Where as other sites have some info nested in a detailed page but not in an actual table spreadsheet that you can sort ascend/descend on by 40+ tickers.

For example, which ones in one industry had the highest 5 YR gain and show next to it the current YTD performance, while looking at if there is a DIV and what the amount is per year, along with PE/EPS in one master table to allow me to sort and filter.

1l6ep40,2025-06-08,"Do I need to buy those Google spreadsheets to research a good stock?
I'm relatively a new investor. I have made good decisions so far by Googling, but I feel like there's more to research before buying a stock. Do I need to buy one of those spreadsheets or pay a monthly fee for a website to access the charts that I need or can I just do the needed research on the app that I buy stocks?

Edit: I don't buy and sell by the way. I only invest for the long term gains.
No rule number one: you never, ever, do, NOT need to buy ANYTHING for investing.  
rule2: use money for investing, not for snakeoil No, you don't. Just use Investopedia to start. They have good basic information and a portfolio scenario tool.

Google Finance also has one.

There are plenty of free sites. No need. Just buy VTI/VXUS/BND Through my library they have access to morning star premium and value line

Note I would probably never pay for these myself but I sometimes do like to read them, also just note its pretty much convince. Companies will publish their earning and quarterly and annual results and other information on the SEC webite or their own web site

The information is all public, these will sort of just summarize the information in a easier to read format. Then some analyst will give their thoughts on the stock, and sometimes talk about the sector as a whole or even competition

However I would not go on these alone, usually I will research a company on my own then I go check out morning star or value line to to see what they are saying and see if there are any red flags I missed in my research

So no, you do not need to pay a monthly fee. However most people should just buy low cost index funds , unless you are weird like me and enjoy reading financial statements and earning reports I use tradingview.com. free to sign up and get good info, can pay for more. Not needed imo Clearly a popular suggestion, but there are people who don’t subscribe to the brainless formula and aren’t interested in the “chill” investment strategy. It’s your money and if you prefer to research your investments, I think you are being smart!

Personally I tend to be a SP500 investor, but I encourage everyone to go beyond 1 line Reddit suggestions when shaping your own future. No. Don't even buy individual stocks. Don't trade at all. Just invest in indexes in a tax advantaged account. If you want to invest, rather than trade, then you should put your money into low-cost index funds that track the whole market. Individual stocks are volatile and risky. The whole market is quite reliable over a span of many years. Before the internet, it was much more difficult to research an investment. You mention buying spreadsheets or paying a monthly fee for website access to data.  I see nothing wrong with paying for information but it is likely that the raw data that someone else is compiling for you is freely available. If you have someone else compile and present the data you could save a lot of time but you might also be bound by the bias/preferences of the group compiling the data whether you paid for it or not.  

As far as the cost goes, if you have a small portfolio, whatever you are spending is likely to be large compared to the value of the decisions you are making. If you have a large portfolio, the cost becomes much less relatively speaking. I have yet to see a source of information that demands a long term commitment. Try those that interest you and don't re-subscribe if you find they don't meet your expectations. 

I do most of my research on the web by myself, and get ideas for things to research myself on the web in the news, comments on reddit and other sites. I have paid for information over the past 30 years I have been doing this but never stayed with any one of them for long.

1l6e3xf,2025-06-08,"[Sector DD] Deep Dive on the APAC Consumer Discretionary Sector for 2025: Thesis, Financials, and Key Risks
I’ve spent the last few weeks conducting a deep dive into the Asia-Pacific Consumer Discretionary sector for 2025. The landscape is complex, with significant macro headwinds balanced by powerful consumer trends and targeted capital flows. I wanted to share my findings and thesis for discussion.

**Thesis:** Despite a cautious macroeconomic outlook for APAC (IMF projects growth decelerating to 3.9%), fertile ground exists for investors. The key is to look past the macro headlines and focus on specific sub-sectors benefiting from structural tailwinds and the rise of the ""Value-Driven Experientialist"" consumer. Strategic capital inflows and trough-level valuations (vs. the US) suggest a significant opportunity for value realization.

**Part 1: The Bull Case - Key Tailwinds & Consumer Shifts**

While the broad economic picture is cautious, several factors support a bullish thesis for specific areas:

* **Strategic Capital Inflows:** In April 2025, APAC equity ETFs saw **$33.3 billion in inflows**, surpassing both US and European markets. This suggests global investors are actively reallocating capital, likely seeking relative value.
* **Consumer Trend 1: The Home as a Hub:** There is a discernible shift towards home-based socializing, entertainment, and wellness. This supports everything from streaming services to home furnishings.
* **Consumer Trend 2: Digitally-Enabled Self-Sufficiency:** Consumers are using tech to manage their health, finances, and skills. This creates opportunities for empowering platforms, not just e-commerce.
* **Structural Growth:** Rapid urbanization in emerging APAC economies provides a long-term, secular tailwind for home-related spending and the growth of a new middle class.

**Part 2: Company-Specific Financials & Data (Putting the Thesis to the Test)**

To see how these trends play out, I looked at recent financials from key companies across different sub-sectors.

* **1. Automotive Evolution (NIO Inc. - NYSE:NIO):** The EV adoption trend is a clear winner.
   * **Q1 2025 Revenue:** RMB 12 billion (**+21.5% YoY**)
   * **Q1 Vehicle Sales:** RMB 9.9 billion (**+18.6% YoY**)
   * **Q1 Deliveries:** 42,094 smart EVs (**+40.1% YoY**)
   * **Vehicle Margin:** 10.2%
   * **Commentary:** This demonstrates explosive growth in the EV ecosystem, validating the ""new mobility"" theme. NIO is also expanding infrastructure (power swap stations), building a moat.
* **2. Home as a Sanctuary (Sekisui House, Ltd. - TYO:1928):** A proxy for the premium home trend.
   * **Q1 FY2025 Revenue:** JPY 894 billion (**Up YoY**)
   * **Q1 GAAP EPS:** JPY 51.48 (**Down YoY**)
   * **Commentary:** The revenue growth reflects the strong underlying demand from urbanization and home-centric lifestyles. The EPS dip warrants further investigation but highlights that even with strong demand, profitability can be complex.
* **3. Education Services Pivot (QuantaSing Group Ltd - NASDAQ:QSG):** Shows the challenges and strategic shifts.
   * **Q3 FY2025 Revenue:** RMB 570.7 million
   * **Net Income:** RMB 41.1 million
   * **Key Event:** Announced a **$20M share buyback**, signaling management confidence in cash flow.
   * **Critical Nuance:** Revenue from its core online learning services *declined*. The company is pivoting, acquiring a ""pop toys"" business to move from ""traffic-driven to high-quality growth."" This highlights execution risk and saturation in certain online learning segments.

**Part 3: Legitimate Risks & Headwinds (The Bear Case)**

A balanced view is essential. The key risks to this thesis are:

* **Macroeconomic Slowdown:** The IMF's revised growth forecast of 3.9% for the region is a significant headwind that cannot be ignored. A broader slowdown could impact consumer confidence more than anticipated.
* **Geopolitical Tensions:** The ""tariff tightrope walk"" between the US and China remains a major variable. An escalation could disrupt supply chains and depress business investment and consumer spending.
* **Inflation & Interest Rates:** A spike in inflation could erode consumer purchasing power for discretionary goods. Higher interest rates also increase borrowing costs for companies, potentially slowing M&A and expansion.
* **Execution Risk:** As seen with QuantaSing, companies pivoting their strategy face immense execution risk. Not all will succeed.
* **Intense Competition:** The APAC market is not a secret. Competition is fierce from global giants, established local players, and increasingly, aggressive Chinese brands expanding across the ASEAN region.

**Conclusion / TL;DR:**

The APAC Consumer Discretionary sector is a market of stocks, not a stock market. A passive, broad-based approach is risky given the macro headwinds. However, for investors willing to do the work, there are compelling opportunities in specific sub-sectors like EVs, premium home goods, localized streaming, and scalable F&B concepts that are aligned with powerful, long-term consumer and demographic trends.

1l5bulm,2025-06-07,"Vaneck Russia EFT and robinhood problems
I want to start this off by saying this really isn't me. My friend still invests on Robinhood for God knows why and has a lot of her money in this Vaneck Russia EFT stock. But it says it's untradable right now and after a quick google search I came across a wall of text that I can't decipher. Is there anyway to get her money back? Is it frozen because of the sanctions? They said something about liquidation and that just didn't sound good to me. Any advice would be helpful.

Btw for the record I personally don't use Robinhood after the disaster that was Dogecoin. So I am no longer familiar with any changes that have occurred on the platform since then.
This has nothing to do with Robinhood. This has everything to do with your friend holding a shitty risky asset that is sanctioned to hell, so the fund is frozen and being liquidated. They wouldn't be able to sell it _anywhere_. legally no. the etf doesn't have access to the clearing house b/c of existing sanction. 

rb will be in violation of sanction if it executes any trades of the etf [vaneck etf](https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/investments/russia-etf-rsx/overview/) They're very obviously trying to paint this as a Robinhood issue instead of a Russian ETF issue. Half the post is poking at the platform for various nonsense, then admitting they found the ETF lock info and glazed over it.

It's a shitpost. You're not supposed to eat the paint chips, man. Just because it's called chips doesnt mean they're like potato chips Yeah, I had some ishares msci Russia ETF shares when the war started and sanctions kicked in. Took like a year for it to be fully liquidated and I lost like 80% of my money. Assuming something similar will happen here, but surprised it didn't happen a long time ago. that is painful to hear. the common shareholders areon the losing end here.  i'm sure fund managers didn't lose their salaries.

what does it mean to liquidate?  
i can see the cash in the form of currency holdings being liquidated but not the holdings of russian companies. why such a hostile tone.  the fund wasn't risky before the invasion?

DISCLAIMER:

* I do not have any position in TSLA beyond through an S&P500 index fund
* I sold my TSLA stock at a 6% loss yesterday after holding for a year. Might buy again if I see progress and if it dips below 225 (or maybe below 185)

EDIT: Clarification on last disclaimer - I bought TSLA about a year ago but bought some more in late 2024 which raised my average costs basis up by a lot 
How did you hold for a year and sell for a 6% loss on a stock that is up 70% in the last year?

You would have had to buy in November or 2022. Certified wallstreetbets redditor lol 1 trillion dollar valuation on 8 billion dollars of declining earnings screams “no thank you” Counterpoint: he waved that chainsaw around. 'Elon has personally attacked a sitting president of the US'

This, generally, is not an issue in the USA. Yet, this is an issue in this USA. Took a peak at his post history. I suspect political inspiration for his Tesla investment, which would make the third point of the post the biggest factor in his withdraw. Buy high sell low duh Why on earth would you ever believe Elon Musk? The man has been a liar and stock manipulator for a decade. Time and time again he's caught straight up lying about his companies in order to pump the stock valuation.

This should be your lesson. Never believe what a CEO says about their own company. The SEC has not bothered to enforce the laws regarding CEO speech and stock manipulation.

I have about 1 3rd of my portfolio made up of AAPL. Everything else is in 401k and ETF’s in Roth IRA’s.

I’m I’d like to diversify a bit and not have so much in AAPL. But, I don’t really want to sell it…

I’m considering setting the drip to buy either other stocks or etf’s. Just wondering how you more seasoned investors would handle that.

Thank you!
I have 30 stocks or more 

Apple is my largest holding and its pretty much that way for everyone i know. Its one i never worry about dispite CNBC always bashing apple daily and being wrong every time

I would buy more stocks not funds How old are you and how many years away is retirement? Probably wouldn't sell since apple is one of those few companies that is hard to be negative in terms of outlook. I would just put future money into other stocks and etfs like you said. Then, ya, i would hold on to apple and just start adding a board ETF like VTI or VT. just know that those ETFs also contain apple \~ usually 3-7 percent of their holdings Why? You're diversifying. And only a small portion of the final product would be in Apple. 40 now. Probably planning to retire around 60. Maybe sooner if possible. Right.

1l4v9dp,2025-06-06,"Ethical investing and Palantir
I'm curious what you all think about this on a personal level. 

I'm going to use Palantir as an example. 

Obviously people have made money off it, likely plenty more money to be made. 

They also go against nearly everything with my ethics and morals, including the AI, spying, data, and Thiel himself most of all. 

So how do you guys handle such situations? 

I refuse to invest in unethical companies thats why I only invest in companies that hide it well.  Like Apple and Nike, who put shiny pictures of people smiling on their website......while lock their workers in sweat factories 14 hours a day until they jump from the top of the building....but I don't read about it so its all good and I in my western morality can feel good about myself by buying from good ethical companies It's difficult to do almost anything with clean hands in the world we live in, whether it's how/what we eat, but, invest in, drive, post photos and words on, text with... Someone is always getting screwed on the other end, it's just a matter of how badly. My rule of thumb with investing is, if it doesn't sit right with me, I don't buy it. Not the best investing strategy, I know, but it is what it is. Let’s be honest though, there’s a huge spectrum at play here. Apple hiring a company that subconstracts to kids in a country where kids working is legal is sorta fucked up, but it isn’t as fucked up as, say, Palantir, whose entire business model is illegally spying on Americans and guiding drones into the heads of civilians. There’s levels and levels of fucked up

That said, it obviously doesn’t matter for the market - there’s strong correlation unethical snd shady companies do better than “ethical” ones, simply because they tackle stuff that’s more profitable and pursue profit at all cost. “Morality is bad for business” Don't agree with most of these comments - its important IMO to invest at least vaguely ethically.  So to that end, companies like Palantir, Lockheed Martin and Shell are definiely not ethical. Everybody giving you a snarky comment. But in reality a lot of what they are saying is true. Separating money from ethics is a difficult task when it comes to investing.   

What you can do is set aside a portion of your portfolio for companies that are in line with your ethics/morales. Even if it’s a portion it means you are going towards supporting a cause or at least a process of thinking you believe in. There are more and less ethical ways of making a profit.

The manufacturer of the Baby-Annihilator 9000 and a company that makes and sells electrical switchgear aren’t exactly on the same level. Harsh truth!  there's no such thing as truly ""ethical"" investing in a capitalist system. most companies have skeletons in the closet. you just gotta decide which moral lines you personally won't cross. for me direct military/surveillance tech is a no-go, but i don't pretend my index funds are squeaky clean either. Pick your battles. fyi the foxconn using child labor stories are largely false

1l45avh,2025-06-05,"Should I move some of my NVDA stock to S&P500 or something else?
Currently, I have ~$27,000 of NVDA stock. I didn't invest this money myself, but it has been doing pretty well over the years and I occasionally take from it when I need to make a larger purchase. I've been looking into investing, and I've seen people say that having an entire fund into an individual stock isn't a good idea. Do you guys suggest that I take some (or all?) of it and invest into the S&P500? Or possibly something else?

Thanks!

Edit:

I should have mentioned: this is my only investment. I know diversifying is a good idea, I just don't know if I should take any money out of NVDA now to invest in something else or just put any future investments in a stock that covers multiple companies. 
I made a significant amount of money on NVDA - when it hit $145 I sold half and moved it to BRK/B and VTI. I think it will probably continue to outperform for a few years but it's easily possible that it could lose steam badly if the AI buzz loses steam. I intend to slowly sell half of the remaining over the next 5 years unless something major changes for the good or bad. Completely depends on what acct it's in and your age and risk tolerance. I also have a very large position in NVDA but I'm 30 yrs away from retirement, I have plenty of time to let it go hyperbolic or not. Depends on if you personally believe in NVDA and their future prospects. I do hold a bunch of NVDA but also hold ETFs and other things. I don't think anyone knows for sure. If you're afraid of the risk being in one place then maybe invest in indexes. Personally I'm keeping the money in NVDA because I believe in their future. I’d sell at least 25-50% put it in whatever ETF you like. NVDA is great but people fail to remember that it’s currently like the most valuable company in the world. It might hit 180 but it’s captured most of its biggest gains already. From here on out it’s either a steady rise or someone steals their thunder I have $234,000. in NVDA at 63 yo, I trust Huang and his vision of the future. I joke to friends that NVDA will be the Genesis system designed by Cyberdyne. It has a bright future and one of the best debt-to-cash ratios out there. ""At 0.21, meaning the company has more cash on hand than debt. Specifically, Nvidia has $53.69 billion in cash and $10.28 billion in total debt. This indicates a strong financial position, with the company having ample liquidity to cover its debt obligations and potential future investments."" AI is still in it's infancy and will continue growing and NVDA is the top dog right now even with all it's volatilty. I would leave your money where it is and start investing in US and international index funds as a means of diversification. Why would this $27,000 be your only investment? You did not say if this money was in a tax sheltered account. If it is not, there may be large tax consequences to selling your NVDA stock to buy other stock. Diversify Yeah this is my only investment 🙃 I'll diversify I sold all the NVDA I had in one of my mainline accounts last week. That's the first time I haven't had NVDA in that account since 2008. I still have some trading shares in my messing about account.

I still think NVDA will have a bright future. But it's been stuck in a range for a year. With all the Trump uncertainties, I can't see how it'll break out. So since it's at the top end of the range now, I sold out. I plan to get back in when it goes towards the low end of the range. I really like NVDA, but I would diversify. I’d sell half and divy that up. Half of the proceeds in S&P and half in TIP, then hold steady for a good long while. I’m conservative and pretty risk averse though.

1l3z94b,2025-06-05,"As CoreWeave's (CRWV) Stock Value Flies - Shareholders Increasingly Turn to Nebius (NBIS) in Shifting AI Cloud Landscape
The AI infrastructure market is experiencing rapid shifts, and recent developments suggest a potential re-evaluation by investors, with some CoreWeave shareholders reportedly looking towards Nebius as a more compelling opportunity.

While CoreWeave has seen significant stock surges and secured major deals, concerns about its profitability, customer concentration, and unique relationship with Nvidia appear to be prompting some investors to explore alternatives.

CoreWeave, a prominent AI hyperscaler, has undeniably made headlines. Following its IPO in late March 2025 at $40 per share, the company's stock has seen a meteoric rise, at one point surging over 200%. This impressive performance has been fueled by substantial infrastructure agreements, including an $11.2 billion revenue backlog with OpenAI, and continued strong demand for its purpose-built AI platform. Nvidia, a key investor and partner, also recently disclosed a 7% stake in CoreWeave, further boosting investor confidence.

However, a closer look reveals some underlying concerns that may be driving a shift in investor sentiment. Analysts have highlighted CoreWeave's reliance on a limited number of customers, with Microsoft alone accounting for approximately 72% of its revenue in Q1 2025. This customer concentration presents a significant risk, particularly as hyperscalers like Microsoft and Google continue to build out their own AI infrastructure. Furthermore, despite its high revenue growth, CoreWeave reported a net loss of $314.6 million in Q1 2025, raising questions about its path to profitability. The company is also heavily burdened by debt, with some estimates suggesting interest payments could balloon to over $2 billion annually.

Enter Nebius, a rising force in the AI cloud space. Nebius has swiftly positioned itself as a serious contender, focusing on building a global footprint with data centers in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East. Like CoreWeave, Nebius also boasts a strong partnership with Nvidia, being a launch partner for NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra AI Factory Platform.

What makes Nebius particularly attractive to some investors is its strategic approach to growth and financing. In December 2024, Nebius secured $700 million in equity funding from investors including Accel and Nvidia, followed by a recent $1 billion debt financing round in June 2025. The company's unique financial position, leveraging ownership and equity stakes in non-core businesses like Toloka and ClickHouse, allows it to fund its aggressive expansion plans for its core AI infrastructure business. Nebius has also been actively expanding its data center capacity, recently adding three new regions, including a strategic data center in Israel.

While both CoreWeave and Nebius are aggressively scaling to meet the surging demand for AI infrastructure, Nebius appears to be gaining traction due to its diversified funding strategy, expanding global reach, and potentially more stable long-term outlook. As the AI cloud market continues to evolve, the ability to rapidly deploy capacity, diversify customer bases, and maintain a sound financial footing will be crucial for sustained success. The reported pivot of some CoreWeave shareholders towards Nebius underscores a growing recognition among investors that while immediate growth is appealing, sustainable profitability and strategic diversification are paramount in this fiercely competitive sector.

Why has investing become so complicated? 
Always been complicated.

Costco trades at a high PE because its seen as the ultimate stable name, huge mote, non cyclical, clean balance sheet, great management.

Is a PE of 60 reasonable? That’s for you to decide You're looking at one stat for a 1 year period. This is absolutely meaningless. Own em both 👍 Because it’s your job to assert facts, preferably more than one, for you argument. 

That which can be explained without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. P/E doesn’t tell the whole story, if you look at other valuation metrics, NVDA is still more expensive than COST Costco pays a small dividend current div yield is like 0.5%.

Sure but how do you figure it will “never drop” thats the hard part Markets are weird like that. Costco's basically paying a premium for being boring and reliable. NVDA's got the crazy growth but tech can be volatile. People will pay extra for that sleep at night factor with Costco, even if the math doesn't make sense on paper.

1l3m3rt,2025-06-05,"AI reminds me of Pets.com of 2000 Dot Com crash
These are known facts

* It costs OpenAI $700,000 per day to operate their models
* GPT-4’s advanced queries cost up to $1,000 each
* OpenAI reported $5 billion in losses in 2024, projecting cumulative losses of **$44 billion** from 2023 to 2028
* Alphabet plans to invest $77 billion in CAPEX on expanding AI infrastructure in 2025

To summarize, this is the current situation. 

1. AI is not currently profitable
2. Companies are taking a develop first, profits later approach
3. NASDAQ and AI related stocks including Nvidia continues to surge with lofty forward P/E set by analysts

To recap the DotCom crash. Let's look at [Pets.com](http://Pets.com) 

1. [Pets.com](http://Pets.com) offered free shipping on low-margin products like bulky pet food, leading to significant losses on each sale. 
2. The company faced stiff competition from both established brick-and-mortar retailers such as Petstore.com and Petopia.com. 
3. The market downturned
4. The company estimated it needed $260 million to break even but had only raised $180 million. 
5. Securing additional funding became impossible during the crash, 
6. [Pets.com](http://Pets.com) goes bankrupt

Now obviously, we are not expecting companies like Google or Microsoft or Meta to go bankrupt. They all have diverse revenue sources and big cash reserves to be able to weather the cash burn. 

However it seems to me those companies going up without a profitable product is clearly reminiscent of the [Pets.com](http://Pets.com) saga, a story of growth at any cost that's bound to crash and burn. 

Thoughts? 




I'm in software/tech and went through dotcom

This is nothing like pets.com. Sure ai is pointless adding it to everything but ai is an amazing dev tool to make me more productive. It's here to stay and some companies will fail but others will become giants Short the AI companies then if this is what you believe. Ok, now show me an argument using financials instead of buzzwords. 

I don't necessarily agree with OP, but your comment sounds like wordslop. I have said AI has wild potential but the market is totally over-hyped, over-bought, and over-exposed. NVDA and others in the category have been propping up much more of the market than themselves alone and is due for a correction.

That said, with the downturn in the market in Q1, why do you think these names just rebounded like it was nothing instead of correcting even more? Seems like a superficial rebound with many of the same underlying problems. Thought? LOL comparing the defining technology of the next century to a website that sold dog food. None of the public companies you mention actually have a cash ‘burn’. In fact they are the most profitable companies in the history of the world. 

Nvidia is nothing like pets.com. Pete.com was losing money. Nvidia is insanely fucking profitable. Have you not used AI at all? It's fing incredible man. Pets.com. what are you even talking about mate?

AI is already disrupting industries. You just haven't felt it yet. ""AI"" in the sense of machine learning, more broadly than just ""ChatGBT make me a picture of a kitten eating chicken nuggets"", has already been around for a while.

Like you're not at all seeing the professional use case and demand that's already there. Blurry? Poor guy and his lazy, dead eye I do not think OP intended this to mean AI usefulness. Look at any internet company or internet infrastructure company. These companies are useful before and after the dotcom crash.  The question is company short-term profitability. Can these AI companies continue to operate at a loss.

1l35vcp,2025-06-04,"On the risks of unregulated brokers and trading software: What MT5 doesn't tell you
In the world of investing, we're often reminded to do due diligence on asset fundamentals — but sometimes, the platform itself is the risk.



I’d like to flag a lesser-known issue for those exploring Forex and CFD markets: brokers operating through MetaTrader 5 (MT5) — a widely used trading interface — can manipulate user experience through server-side plug-ins. These tools allow a broker to:



Delay or simulate trade execution,



Display artificial spreads or price movement,



Block or stage fake withdrawal processes,



Mimic connection to liquidity providers.



Because MT5 is just software — not a broker or exchange — any entity can license it and operate behind the scenes with zero transparency. The result is a trading environment where your experience is completely controlled by the server owner.



This creates a regulatory blind spot: a user may think they’re trading the real market, but in reality they’re just interacting with a simulation.



Key takeaway for investors:No matter how polished the UI or familiar the platform name, always verify the regulatory status of the entity you’re funding. If possible:



Use demo accounts first,



Check if the broker is regulated by tier-1 financial authorities (FCA, ASIC, etc.),



Compare trade data with public sources like TradingView.



Platform integrity is an overlooked part of investment infrastructure — and it deserves as much scrutiny as the asset itself.
""Because MT5 is just software — not a broker or exchange...""

People can do the same shenanigans you describe. >If anyone knows warning signs or red flags to watch for, I’d be really grateful.

What country are you in? Brokers are regulated and registered. Just search your country's brokerage registry. 

Or do a google search on the company or just ask someone. Questionable brokers and schemes often get discussed on places like Reddit. What are you talking about?

In the US - CFD's are illegal. And there is no such thing as an unregulated broker for derivatives, equities, or fixed income. It is either a regulated broker - or it's an illegal scam.

In other developed countries - it's exactly the same thing. Brokers must be registered and they are regulated.

Yes - scams happen - it doesn't have anything to do with MT5. And anyone that trades using MT5 or similar trading applications - I would expect that they have the experience to use such a product.

Anyone that uses MT5 without actual trading and some industry experience - well -- they probably shouldn't be using MT5.

The same thing that you described with MT5 can occur with any platform. It has pretty much nothing to do with a trading tool but everything to do with what third-party plugins, software, etc. that a trader chooses to use. ""Unregulated broker"" ?

If a person is new type 'broker regulation (+name of your country)' into search.

https://www.finra.org/investors/investing/working-with-investment-professional/about-brokercheck

They have a little 1 minute video ""Anybody that wants to sell stock, bonds, or mutual funds has to be registered.""

Or just stick to the big well known names. Do a little research to find the best one for you. True.   
I wish I’d known that earlier — I was one of the people who got scammed this way. Everything looked real… but it wasn’t.  


Now I’m just trying to figure out how to protect myself next time.  
If anyone knows warning signs or red flags to watch for, I’d be really grateful. When doing stuff with money I can't afford to lose, I usually look for an org that is too big to fail. And the more highly regulated, the better. These scam can be horrible. And some of them can be hard to spot. 

Yes - unfortunately - it can happen with any platform.

And all trading platforms allow plugins - no trader will use a platform that doesn't allow them to load their own modules for trading. Even trading platforms provided by legitimate brokers like Thinkorswim from Schwab allow for third-party tools. If a trader decides to use a third-party tool or even a third-party platform like MT5, Metastock, Wealthlab, Tradingview, etc. etc. - it's up to that trader to understand what they are doing.

There is a reason why many people do not recommend the use of third-party tools if someone is inexperienced.

Personally - I would never use MT5 - simply because of how they are structured. If you already knew that MT5 was Russian based - why the heck did you use their tooling.

And yes - if you are the victim of a scam - it's on you. And your recourse is to seek assistance from your country's consumer protection organization.

Frankly - your post helps no one - if you want to call out the scammer - call out the name of the scamming firm.

FWIW - all these scammers suck and I'm sorry that you ended up a victim. Yes, this can happen with any platform, right? But it happened with MT5, and MT5 takes no responsibility. That’s the point.

From MT5’s side — why not build the software in a way that makes it impossible to use these plug-ins at all?

When you become a victim of a scam, you're left alone with the problem — and the only traceable endpoint is MetaTrader.

Why is MT5 such a socially irresponsible business?  
Is it because it’s Russian-owned? And you trust TradingView ?  You do realize unless it comes directly from an exchange all brokers that offer financial services to retail use retransmission vendors which are not regulated.

1l32ny6,2025-06-04,"Global Defense Sector Poised for Growth: Analysis of EU, Asian & Australian Defense Spending Surge
I've been tracking the defense sector over the past few months and wanted to share some research on what looks like a significant multi-year growth trend. With increasing geopolitical tensions, defense budgets are expanding globally, creating potential opportunities across several markets. 

I ran some analysis through KNK Research AI（https://knkresearchai.com/ ）to help connect the dots on global defense spending patterns, and found some interesting companies positioned to benefit from these trends. The tool also helped me evaluate different investment strategies for the sector - pretty handy for seeing the big picture. 

Current Landscape: The European Union, particularly Germany, has dramatically increased defense budgets, with approximately €500B allocated to boost military and infrastructure spending. Simultaneously, Asian countries including Japan, South Korea, India, and Taiwan are ramping up defense expenditures and modernizing their forces. Australia is also strengthening its military capabilities in partnership with the US.

https://preview.redd.it/xpd16p5m6w4f1.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6f938c89b395560743bd5e96aaa37a30e7da1f4

Key Companies to Watch: 

Rheinmetall AG (RHM.DE) - Core beneficiary of EU/German defense budget surge with a strong order pipeline and margin expansion potential

Hanwha Aerospace (South Korea) - Benefiting from South Korean defense budget increases and US alliance cooperation 

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (Japan) - Key player in Japan's military modernization program with focus on advanced defense systems 

Hyundai Rotem (South Korea) - Seeing strong order flow from both domestic and export markets, including Eastern Europe 

Austal (Australia) - Well-positioned for Australian defense industrial expansion and US-Australia defense cooperation

Historical Context: 

This spending surge shares similarities with previous defense cycles: 

Post-9/11 Defense Buildup (2001-2008): Defense equities outperformed broader markets due to sustained government contracts 

Cold War Military Expansion: Government spending commitments provided multi-decade stability for defense firms 

Russia-Ukraine Conflict Impact: European defense stocks have rallied on expectations of increased budgets

https://preview.redd.it/e640g2os6w4f1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=476fef3777a21fc5371638efea5f701f1cb02f69

Potential Risks: 

Budget constraints if economic conditions deteriorate Political changes affecting defense priorities Contract delays and geopolitical uncertainties Export control restrictions limiting international sales Regional geopolitical tensions affecting supply chains 

My Approach: 

I'm building a diversified basket of defense stocks across these regions rather than concentrating on a single company. Currently watching for entry points in several of these names.

I've been monitoring key catalysts including: 

Implementation of EU/German defense budget increases Progress of Asian modernization programs Geopolitical developments in the Indo-Pacific region Contract awards and backlog growth 

What are your thoughts on the defense sector? Anyone else watching these companies or have insights on this space?
Defense stocks like Rheinmetall have already surged significantly since 2022. Are you potentially buying at peak valuations after the easy money has been made? Your regional diversification approach makes sense, though supply chain risks aren't fully addressed here. Many defense contractors face significant component sourcing challenges and export control restrictions that could impact margins and delivery timelines.  These defense budget increases already priced into these stocks smart money probably rotated out already while retail is just catching on I've been long EUAD for a while and they include Airbus which looks poised for strong non-military growth as well as China wants to buy 500 of their planes. Europe and China are negotiating on rare earths too in an overall trade pact.

One of the problems which has turned up is that rare earths are needed to make defense products and China probably isn't keen to support other countries building products that may be used against them in the future. China would probably like to have the export ban on ASML EUV machines lifted.

1l2aqgh,2025-06-03,"Plan around 80k insurance limit
Do people actually plan around the \*85\*K insurance cap? Do you open accounts with separate brokers, and have to keep track across multiple accounts? This seems really impractical and inconvenient?

Soon approaching, and need to figure out how seriously to consider it.

Edit: sorry - a bit of googling shows this is UK specific (and actually 85K), so should've posted in a UK only thread. Apologies.
I’m not sure what is the 80k you are referring to?!? 
FDIC?? Sorry What's the 80k insurance cap? There's no such thing. The what?  What country do you live in? Most countries have some sort of mandatory insurance that would cover missing assets or other brokerage fraud, in the USA its called SIPC however the ""limit"" is 500k of assets what 250k could be cash. I should also note that even if you do not live in the USA, if you have a USA brokerage with say Schwab, or IBKR you are still entitled to this coverage

It also should be noted that brokerages and banks work different . A bank commingles money , people deposit money into a bank, the bank can use the money to loan out or for its own expenses . If the loans go bad or there is a bank run it might have to try to liquidate and there may not be enough money to cover deposits

Brokerages really do not commingle assets , its very illegal if they do and would be fraud, in overly simplistic terms they work more like a safty deposit box to store assets

If you buy 1 million dollars of VTI the brokerage""stores"" the shares . The brokerage cannot use the shares to pay expenses or it creditors cannot lay claim to the shares.

If the brokerage goes bankrupt your 1 million dollars of VTI is still stored there and can be transferred out.  So when brokerages go bankrupt its usually not a huge deal because of this segregation . You transfer your assets out to a different brokerage or usually some other brokerage steps in and takes over .

I think the biggest issue what I will fully admit I am not a expert on is fintechs that seems to offer brokerage or banking services but are not an actual regulated bank or brokerage

The whole Yotta debacle were they sort of advertised themself as a ""bank"" but they were not actually a bank, or brokerage so when they went bust there was little recourse for depositors(Technically it was another fintech that yotta used for banking services that went bust)

Meaning use an actual bank or brokerage not some new fin-tech company that is not a regulated bank or brokerage but just offers ""bank or brokerage services"" Do you mean that: “you are about to reach an insurance cap”?       80k is your insurance cap?


Ex: My investment platform is (SIPC insured).     SIPC insurance cap is ($500k US dollars).        Once I have manually allocated exactly ($500k US dollars/have reached SIPC insurance cap) — I will then: 


     —>(1)stop manually allocating money to the “investment platform that I reached the max of SIPC insurance.”


     —>(2)I might open up another investment account, at another investment platform, “in which there is a new insurance cap.”           So that I never exceed the insurance cap limit.




If my investment platform were to completely (go bankrupt/shut down).       Then I could legally file to be re-compensated “$500k US dollars.”     Since that is related to the (SIPC insurance cap).


     -EX: would you want to manually allocate “more that $250k US dollars” to a US bank account that is covered by (FDIC insurance)?          Probably not, if you want to be safe — because:


          ->since you went over the ($250k insurance cap).      In the event of a bank failure, (you would only be compensated the maximum of $250k US dollars) and (anything over $250k US dollars will not be returned to you).        Lost money. The difference is when banks fail since the money is commingled , that means there is not enough money to cover depositors

Brokerages do not do this, the assets has to be legally separated. Meaning when brokerages fail , usually nothing happens assets are just transferred out

Basically SIPC is not needed unless there is fraud ; a normal brokerage going bankruipt like bear sterns or Lehman didn't even need SIPC to step in because the assets were segregated .

Even in the case of FTX, they also allowed you to purchase stocks/ETFs. Even though the company was a fraud due to regulations if you had bought stock or ETFs through FTX, those were segregated and could be transferred to another brokerage . The crypto side was completely unregulated so on the crypto side you were toast but if you have 1 million of VOO in FTX, you would not have been affected except maybe some hassle of transferring the VOO out to a different brokerage .

Technically FTX was not a brokerage it was like a ""pass through boker"" ; for stocks/ETF they partnered with an actual USA based regulated brokerage so if you bought 1 million of VOO through FTX , your VOO was fine as it was held at an actual brokerage ; your cash and crypto would be lost however SIPC covers up to $500K.

1l0fjpz,2025-06-01,"Why doesn’t an ETF exist for the wheel strategy? Selling cash secured puts and covered calls.
There are ETFs like JEPI that rely on covered calls for income but they only account for half on the income equation. 

I have continuously followed a wheel strategy and gotten consistent, solid premium income while rotating between cash secured puts and covered calls. 

Selling cash secured puts, delta ~0.30, weekly from Monday to Friday. If not assigned repeat next week. If assigned, sell covered calls, delta ~0.20, weekly as well until called away. Repeat.

Gives consistent income, gives opportunity for SPY appreciation, and protects downside decently. It’s not perfect, but it’s just as good as JEPI with a different approach. 
Mathematically, covered calls and cash secured puts are the same position. They have identical return profiles. The covered call ETFs are doing the wheel, just without the catchy branding. They do exist, google ""covered call ETFs"".

There are good reasons to only do part of it.

Theres a big different between you running a single wheel and trying to run basically 100,000 at the same time.

Most will do sythetics covered calls which are long call + short put + short call. If you have an hour or two of free time you should read up on ""put-call parity"" which explains the mathematical relationship between the prices of puts and calls. The short response to your point is that the value of the risk-free rate (which is what you're getting in the money market fund) is embedded into the put + call prices, so while you may psychologically appreciate the trickle of interest entering your account on the put side, in the long run there's not actually a difference. Yieldmax How has your annual return been using the wheel strategy? qyld is really good covered call dividend etf and yeildmaxs as well I guess my difference in strategy is that when I am selling cash secured puts the money used for collateral still gains money market interest while I get the premium for the week.

1lngz3x,2025-06-29,"Congressional Trading Report - June’s Largest Buys, Sells
# Congress’ Largest Buys - June Edition

https://preview.redd.it/x5mbu44ssv9f1.png?width=1446&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1825dbcaf666105a71f97c22cb2c83f405aa3ae

On the buy side this month, there are a few standouts. One of the largest single purchases comes from **Suzan DelBene**, who dropped **$500k-$1M into FPAYF**, a foreign payment solutions stock, definitely an interesting pick in the fintech space. She also made a sizable bond purchase tied to the University of Texas, likely a steady yield play.

Then you’ve got **John Hickenlooper**, who made back-to-back buys in **Liberty Broadband (LBRDA and LBRDK)** \- both tracking in the **$250k-$500k** range. That’s a fairly concentrated bet on telecom/media, potentially tied to broader bullishness on Charter Communications or data infrastructure demand.

On the alternative asset side, **Scott Peters** quietly slipped into a private equity investment via **Lynett Capital Partners III**, which tends to be a long-term, illiquid type of play.

Republican **Michael McCaul** made smaller but notable buys in **Stanley Black & Decker (SWK)** and **Nucor (NUE)**, which both track with industrial and manufacturing exposure (maybe a macro bet on domestic production or infrastructure).

But the most eyebrow-raising is probably **Brandon Gill**, who went heavy on **Bitcoin**, with **three separate BTC buys in June** all sized between **$100k-$250k**. This lines up perfectly with Bitcoin's bounce off recent lows, but whether it’s a long-term conviction or a speculative swing trade is anyone’s guess.

On the flip side, the sell side is arguably more interesting this month. The biggest sells come from **Jefferson Shreve**, who unloaded **$500k-$1M of Apple (AAPL)** on June 23. He also trimmed **Amazon (AMZN)**, **Costco (COST)**, **Coca-Cola (KO)**, **Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/B)**, and even another Apple chunk later that same day. This reads like a broad de-risking of mega-cap names rather than something company-specific.

Meanwhile, **Markwayne Mullin** made back-to-back **SPY sells**, both in the **$500k-$1M** range, on June 10 and 11. Could be hedging, could be fading the recent move toward all-time highs, or simply reducing overall exposure into summer volatility.

On the fixed income side, **Suzan DelBene** offloaded **$250k-$500k in Ohio State municipal bonds**, which doesn’t scream anything shady, more likely just repositioning.

The rest of the sells include **Tim Moore’s** sale of **American Airlines (AAL),** potentially a macro call on rising fuel costs and geopolitical risk, plus Shreve’s broader trimming across consumer staples and industrials.

# And a Quick Note on Rob Bresnahan...

One person who didn’t take a break in June? **Republican Rob Bresnahan**, who filed **54 separate trades this month alone (!!)**. Safe to say, nobody’s actively trading more than this guy on Capitol Hill right now.

Markets will take a break Friday to observe the Independence Day holiday. Last week, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite finished at record highs, lifted by an upbeat Friday session for stocks.

# Jobs Report Comes as Fed Watches for Signs of Labor Market Weakening

Thursday’s scheduled release of June jobs numbers comes as the labor market has remained resilient despite concerns of a hiring slowdown.

Employers added more jobs than expected in May, though hiring slowed slightly from the prior month. Economists expect the labor market to slow as companies face uncertainty from tariffs, while a recent consumer survey showed heightened worries about the state of the job market.

Federal Reserve officials have pointed to strong job growth as a reason to hold interest rates at current levels, even as inflation has declined. Trump has put pressure on the Fed to cut rates, with some officials now open to the idea. Fresh data from the labor market could give investors more insight into whether rate cuts are coming.

Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” will be in the spotlight as the Senate works to pass the budget package ahead of Trump's deadline. Investors will also be eyeing updates on Trump’s tariff policy ahead of a July 9 deadline to negotiate new deals with U.S. trading partners. (Officials have said the tariff timeline could be delayed.) Trump on Friday said trade talks with Canada were over.

Constellation Brands, the maker of Modelo and Corona beers, is scheduled to report earnings Tuesday, a report due after it trimmed its outlook in the previous quarter. EV maker Tesla is expected to report June deliveries Wednesday, offering a full picture of the first half of the year for its car business.

Before closing on Friday for the Independence Day holiday, markets will also close early on Thursday.

1lmwdv7,2025-06-28,"Week Recap: Israel-Iran ceasefire agreement came. The S&P 500 completed 5-day winning streak and closed at new all-time high on Friday. What's next? June 23, 2025 – June 27, 2025
First of all, I don't want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it visualized via closing prices from June. 20 to June 27. 

After 2-week losing streak, the stock market closed on the positive side. Despite the negative closes the past 2-week, the results were minimal and just 0.38 and 0.15. As you see the below, it was not deep correction. We've seen much bigger losses before like 9% in this year 😀

Here are the S&P 500's week-by-week results,

May. 30 close at 5,911.69 - June 6 close at 6,000.36 🟢 (+1.49%)

June 6 close at 6,000.36 - June 13 close at 5,976.97 🔴 (-0.38%)

June 13 close at 5,976.97 - June 20 close at 5,967.84 🔴 (-0.15%)

June 20 close at 5,967.84 - June 27 close at 6,173.07 🟢 (3.44%)

🔸 Monday: The week started with monitoring to Middle East tensions. Before the session, White House said Trump 'Still interested' in Iran diplomacy. The stock market opened flat. Tesla launched a small fleet of self-driving taxis in Austin, Texas. The stock helped to lift the stock market because it gained more than 8%. However, Iran attacked U.S. bases in Doha, Qatar. In result, the S&P 500 gained over 1% and closed above 6,000 once again. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: Israel-Iran ceasefire agreement came and the stock market opened higher. Powell spoke at the congressional testimony and he still pointed to tariffs effect and inflation. The stock market closed with second session of solid gains. 🟢

🔸 Wednesday: Compared to previous 2-day, Wednesday was a quiet. The stock market opened slightly higher. During the session, Trump said 2 important things. First one is he going to talk to Iran next week. Second one is begun interviewing candidates to replace Fed Chair with 3 to 4 names. As a result, the stock market closed flat, but still in positive. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: Q1 GDP data was released before the session. The U.S. economy shrank 0.5%. On the other hand, jobless claims is the lowest level for 6-week. As a result, the stock market opened slightly higher. During the session, gains accelerated and closed nearly all-time high. By the way, U.S. Dollar dropped the lowest level since March 2022. 🟢

🔸 Friday: PCE inflation was released. Core PCE inflation came higher than expectations. It came mounthly at 0.2% and increased yearly from 2.6% to 2.7%. This is Fed's favorite economic indicator. We would have prefer equal or lower than expectations. However, Scott Bessent said a trade deal with China could be finalized by Labor Day. The stock market opened higher. Near the end of the session, Trump announced terminating all discussions on trade with Canada. The indexes tumbled, but recovered again. The S&P 500 closed at new all-time high. 🟢

The next Fed meeting at July 29-30 and the stock market still isn't await rate cut (datas from CME FedWatch Tool which you can find via Google search). The stock market closed very good week. The only negative impact came from Trump yesterday. When I saw the message on Truth Social, I expected closed lower. However, the stock market closed at new all-time high. The previous record was 6,147 on February 19, so nice to see this after the 3 months.

What do you think? How was your week?

News: [China Us Agree Details Of London Trade Framework Trade Agreement Beijing](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/27/china-us-agree-details-of-london-trade-framework-trade-agreement-beijing.html)

[**NKE (Nike)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NKE&p=d)\-Reported EPS of $0.14 vs. $0.13 expected; revenue of $11.1B vs. $10.72B expected. Despite the miss on earnings, the NKE CEO expressed cautious optimism, stating that while improvements are expected, a full recovery remains distant (mainly due to tariffs which he said would have a $1B impact). Also forecasted \~5% Q1 sales decline, a better outlook than the 7% drop forecasted. Interested in seeing if this breaks $70 today. Sportswear and LULU have been inconsistent in recovery from tariffs, interested to see if LULU moves (and has potentially recovery) from this.

[**OKLO (Oklo Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OKLO&p=d)\- Reportedly, the Trump administration is preparing executive actions to enhance energy infra and AI. The administration will release an ""AI Action Plan"" on July 23. These measures aim to address grid congestion, permitting delays, by declaring a national energy emergency. I'm seeing OKLO move off this but I'm interested other nuclear energy stocks as well. OKLO failed to break $60 in premarket but interested in watching further.

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\-NVDA hit an all-time high along with the market, as the U.S. and China agreed on a trade framework and Iran/Israel tensions de-escalated. Momentum has continued as macro fears (mainly from Israel/Iran) die down and AI infrastructure investment remains elevated (CRWV acquiring CORZ). Interested in seeing if NVDA can hold above prior day's low ($153.49), momentum is pretty sustained and the move can continue far longer than anyone can expect. Since the trade framework with China was agreed upon, the next catalyst I'm potentially interested in is lifting of chip restrictions in China.

[**PONY (Pony AI)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PONY&p=d)/UBER- UBER is reportedly in talks to support Travis Kalanick’s acquisition of the US arm of Pony AI. A successful deal would reintroduce Kalanick to the self-driving space, and potentially integrate autonomous capabilities within Uber’s broader platform strategy. News happened yesterday, and we don't typically see further movement but I'm interested if there's a competing bid. LYFT/TSLA didn't move off this so not too interested.

This is still extremely run up (to me). Note that it is mainly run up due to the hype from the senate bill (GENIUS Act). Overall trying to see if we get even close to breaking $200 today. Cbase and HOOD have moved as well (upwards). Typically has a somewhat wide spread (ranges from .50 to $1) so I'm mainly trying to churn as little in this as possible.

Fragment of a comment I read: ""Hims/Hers is advertising Wegovy all over the place, but if you go through their signup process, they have you fill out a questionnaire to supposedly see which medication is best for you. And if you say price is a big factor for you, then they recommend their own COMP'd meds over the name brand."" According to NVO, the decision comes after Hims & Hers allegedly failed to comply with laws prohibiting mass sales of COMP'd drugs.

Mainly interested in a technical breakout at $150 if it forms. We're nearing it premarket, but I'm mainly interested to see if this breaks it in a significant way at the open.

1ljlma5,2025-06-24,"Nvidia stock jumps to highest levels since January with record high close in sight
Nvidia stock ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) jumped 2.6% Tuesday to $147.90 per share, ending the trading session at its [highest level since its record close in January](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-jumps-to-highest-levels-since-january-with-record-high-close-in-sight-183528480.html).

Nvidia notched a record closing price of $149.43 on Jan. 6.

The AI chipmaker’s stock has undergone a significant turnaround following its first quarter earnings in late May, which featured [revenue that beat Wall Street’s expectations](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-beats-on-q1-revenue-warns-of-8-billion-sales-hit-in-q2-from-h20-export-ban-122728111.html) and showed [the company continuing to thrive](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-is-looking-past-nvidias-china-problem-for-now-192153114.html) despite a new export ban on sales of its chips to one of its largest markets: China.

Shares have jumped more than 9% since Nvidia’s May 28 earnings report, far ahead of the S&P 500’s roughly 3.5% gain in that time frame.
In other words Nvidia is up less than 0.50% in the past 8 months. Remember, that $147.90 is worth 12% less than it was in January due to a declining dollar If you were smart and kept buying the dips, you're up quite nicely. Title should be ""Nvidia back where it was before a major market manipulation derailed it and a ton of other stocks"". Stop spinning the fact things are finally rising from blatant market manipulation as a good thing. We would have been farther along if someone didn't put cement shoes on the market in March/April. Not if you use the money to buy things in dollars. Nvidia is **still** **undervalued**. Agentic applications will increase GPU demand not by 15x until 2035 but by 50-100x. Running an agentic task is like asking ChatGPT to give you 20 answers in parallel. And every company or individual professional will want to use those agents to automate all kind of things from accounting, software development, marketing, sales, design etc.  
Even if Chinese firms catch up till then or we have 1-2 years of smaller sales due to tariffs, Nvidia will sell way more in the long run than what is priced in right now.

Source: I am heavily invested so please let me be right. Selling a lot of holdings in my Roth and HSA accounts and concentrating in nvidia as it approached $100 has turned out to be a great decision but it involved quite a risk.

Hello everyone and especially Tesla investors/ Holders, 

How do you handle such uncertainty? 

When Musk actions seriously shakes the roots such as one day doing everything right and next day just speaking against President of USA in such depth and getting back to fixing it all again? 

How do you handle such this type of volatility? 
Don't you think it makes it very hard to invest in such stock for long term? 

Err zoom out on the chart - It's up 5000% in 6 years. 

Most people are OK averaging 800%/year when the banks offer them 4%> I am holding firm 250 P 9/19…. Robotaxi is just bs melon is playing…. Uhhh it's been like this since for years Tesla ""investors"" I'm short on it.  Mostly as a hedge.  Though I made a killing with the Trump Musk baby fights. I bought Tesla over 10 yrs ago I’m holding for another 10yrs until I hit 80 yrs of age !
Up over 2700% even at today’s prices
I believe in the company. This is a wrong calculation:

6*800% = +_ 5000%
But actually you have an average gain of 34%/year
Since (1.34)^6 = +_6 You get used to it  It’s all about managing position size and having a long term view don't look every second, every day.

TSLA surged massively yesterday (325->359) because of the robotaxi launch on Sunday, and streamers caught some traffic violations. Most obvious catalyst here is if regulators pull Robotaxi out of Austin, but I doubt that will happen. Also interseted to see if we move up for a second day.

We saw the market move up yesterday (and oil fall) due to Trump saying that the Israel and Iran conflict was set to end in a ceasefire. This may be a telegraphed move to say that the ceasefire might not hold. If so then we may see a surge in oil if the conflict continues and the market fall. Overall I'm mainly interested in the moves of oil because this actually hasn't budged VIX too much.

[**CRCL (Circle)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&p=d)\-“Rules of the road” framework unveiled by Senators. The bipartisan GENIUS Act passed the Senate 68–30 to regulate stableCs. CRCL moved up to $299 yesterday and then sell off after a MASSIVE move since the IPO- I think that the selloff from the move was saved primarily due to Trump's announcement of the Iran/Israel ceasefire (which caused the entire market to move up). We might see another selloff today- still short biased in this and not interested in this long. 

Random risks I'm thinking of that could kill momentum: The bill now has to pass the House; dilution by the STABLE Act could change issuer oversight, and international competition (Tether) could beat this in the longrun.

[**NTRS (Northern Trust Corp)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NTRS&p=d)\-Northern Trust shares surged Friday \~8% after reports that Bank of New York Mellon approached the company about a potential merger. Overall wasn't an extremely interesting catalyst but NTRS said they're committed to remaining independent, so we may see additional updates on this. (Most companies that are committed to remaining independent are holding out for a higher buyout price).

> President Trump accused both Israel and Iran of violating a ceasefire

Oh man... Did he just make the whole thing up? Did he read about a ceasefire on twitter or something? I think they did violate the ceasefire though, sirens went off in northern Israel soon after the “ceasefire.” I think it’s likely a political move to secure US stock market or to step out of the war.

1lja0w1,2025-06-24,"Powell to tell Congress Fed can 'wait' on rate cuts as Trump pressure intensifies
No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/powell-to-tell-congress-fed-can-wait-on-rate-cuts-as-trump-pressure-intensifies-123003818.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/powell-to-tell-congress-fed-can-wait-on-rate-cuts-as-trump-pressure-intensifies-123003818.html)

**Fed Policy Outlook**

* Powell says the Fed is “well positioned to wait” on rate changes.
* Cites uncertainty from Trump’s tariffs as a key reason for caution.
* Emphasizes the need to monitor whether inflation effects are temporary or persistent.
* Fed has held interest rates steady for four straight meetings.
* Powell stresses the Fed’s responsibility is to prevent short-term inflation from becoming long-term.

**Political Pressure**

* Trump demands rate cuts to 1–2% from the current 4.25–4.5%.
* He called Powell a “Total and Complete Moron.”
* Publicly pressured the Fed via social media early Tuesday morning.
* Hinted he may fire Powell before his term ends in May 2026.

**Internal Fed Division**

* Fed Governors Bowman and Waller now support rate cuts as early as July.
* Bowman argues that recent inflation has been soft and the labor market is weakening.
* Fed’s dot plot shows a split:
   * 8 officials expect two cuts in 2025
   * 7 expect no cuts (up from 4 previously)

**Inflation & Economic Risks**

* Powell notes rising goods prices due to new tariffs.
* More inflationary effects from tariffs expected in coming months.
* Trump’s military actions in Iran raise risks of oil price spikes.
* JPMorgan warns oil could hit $120/barrel, potentially driving inflation to 5%.
* Some on Wall Street argue conflict may accelerate rate cuts instead.

**Independence & Public Messaging**

* Powell likely to downplay Trump’s criticism in testimony.
* Reiterates he plans to serve his full term through May 2026.
* Says policy changes are still evolving and their effects remain uncertain.
Are there polymarket odds of Trump calling  Powell gay on X by EOY? People and corporations who want to borrow want the cut. They're mostly already immune to inflation and are jut looking to borrow without paying interest on the loan. 

What they're not telling you is the current rate is what is holding inflation back. Higher prices are still in effect and circling around for the opportunity to go through the roof. Trump would never do that. 

He only posts on Truth Social. A massive thorn in the orange morons side you've  got to respect him for that. Yup whether people agree or not with Powell’s decisions he’s not letting Trump bully him. And not many people can say that. Trump's moves have damaged long term economic outlooks. Trump wants rate cuts as a way to diffuse some of it, so he can keep on acting like a mafia boss running a protection racket threatening tariffs on companies and countries..and also running pump n dumps off it like he's found a free money glitch in the system. He's basically a child that learned putting jet fuel in the car engine makes it go faster for his own sake, but wants someone else to eat the damage control to allow him to keep doing it. I still don't understand what this rate cutting is supposed to accomplish. Nobody can ""set"" the rate, the market does. The (long-term) rates have been rising since earlier this year despite the FED not raising their rates. So wouldn't ""cutting"" the rates just push up long-term rates even more? Expansion and buying market share. What pressure? Whiny tweets? Why would they need to borrow when there’s record profits & layoff every other week!?

Also Bribery is legal now so how much money is being funneled “under the table”?

1liqwar,2025-06-23,"Hims & Hers drops 30% after Novo Nordisk ends Wegovy direct sales deal
No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hims--hers-stock-plummets-after-novo-nordisk-ends-wegovy-direct-sales-deal-153950615.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hims--hers-stock-plummets-after-novo-nordisk-ends-wegovy-direct-sales-deal-153950615.html)

**ChatGPT Highlights:**

* **Stock Crash:** HIMS dropped \~30% after Novo Nordisk (NVO) ended its Wegovy sales partnership.
* **Legal Conflict:** Novo accused Hims of illegally selling compounded semaglutide (a Wegovy copycat) under false personalization claims.
* **Hims' Response:** CEO Andrew Dudum said Novo tried to pressure them into steering patients to branded Wegovy; he rejected the ""anticompetitive"" demands.
* **Background:** FDA allowed compounded GLP-1s during shortages, but branded supply has since normalized. Some pharmacies still sell copycats via legal loopholes.
* **Growth Concerns:**
   * Revenue growth slowed from 45% (Q3 2024) to 29% (Q1 2025).
   * FTC's new July rule will simplify canceling subscriptions, possibly increasing churn.
   * Congressional scrutiny of direct-to-consumer drug ads may further impact Hims.
* **Potential Upside:** Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) could add $4M–$12M in 2025, tapping into a $3B–$10B market.

**Overall Outlook:** Regulatory and legal risks are mounting, with slowing growth in core segments. HRT offers some long-term upside.
That a brutal drop. Both of them should have done more homework before they signed the deal. Ending a deal after only two months is really short. Does this have something to do with the ousting of Novo CEO? This in no way explains how you came up with the number 30. Ousting novo CEO didn’t do well so he’s being replaced. I am not sure nvo is a good buy now tho. After the drop they're still priced for a lot of growth.  Wegovy is an expensive drug that a lot of people want, so being able to resell it was probably very lucrative and now that's gone.  Looking at their earnings report, they don't offer much of a breakdown of their revenue so it's hard to estimate the impact.

Zooming out, I really don't know how to assess the brand power or moat of a prescription mill but they do seem to be good at identifying which drugs people will seek out a prescriber for.  Low testosterone and menopause drugs are on their roadmap. If third party sellers are not allowed, that’s a good thing for Novo, right? In the short term this will decimate their earnings. They charge $500/mo for a medication that is compounded for them at $50/month. I know because I have a friend that has gotten the same compounding pharmacy they prescribe through to provide for her patients. 

I’m sure there are other opportunities out there but to find something that has as much demand with as huge of a margin.. good luck with that It has more to do with there no longer being a shortage, so third party sellers are no longer allowed. Yes! Good for Novo, and also good for Eli Lilly as they make Mounjaro/Tirzepatide.

Since people can no longer get Ozempic or Mounjaro from His/Hers/Ro/Mocchi Health, etc., they will now have to go to a doctor, be prescribed, and fill the script at the pharmacy.


Doctors can still prescribe compounded versions, but they prescribe in office and the compounding pharmacy delivers, or the patient picks it up.

There are only 7500 compounding pharmacies in the U. S, so good for them, too. Why shouldn’t I invest a good chunk of money into it very soon? A pretty sizable positive correction is due right?

HI all, i invested about 350k into Amzn and this thing is red every single day while everything is up. i need some genuine advice on what to invest in. i might cut my losses before this stock goes to 160-170. where can i park my money and except to make some money
If you are new to investing and just got a windfall of $350K, put it in a high yield savings account until you have learned enough to invest yourself rather than asking strangers on Reddit for advice who have no skin in your game. A month ago OP was apparently 100% invested in NVDA. Now 100% invested in AMZN.

Amazing what people will do with their money. It’s amazon, give it 1-2 years and you’ll be up 50-100k. Don’t even look at it. I wouldn’t cut your losses. Amazon isn’t going anywhere. It will go back up. Once you break even, though, I would sell and invest in good growth stock mutual funds. Maybe one containing multiple S&P 500 companies. That said, I would consult a professional or someone with far more experience than I. Good luck. Are you saying I shouldn't go all in on an overvalued stock? 

Ha! What's next? I shouldn't add sugar to Coke?

Wake up, Grandpa, the future is now. If you're gonna invest, do it long term. Dont pull out your money every time it dips a couple of percents. > where can i park my money and except to make some money

Generally speaking, non-professional investors should not be investing in individual companies. Especially if you want to park your money. You buy mutual funds or exchange traded funds instead. 

As for suggestions: I dunno. At any other time there are some good options available, but Trump is Trumpin'. A managed fund is probably best for the time being. It will have a high expense ratio, but will also have people watching out for you. 

After Trump you can move the money over to a low-cost index fund. I wish I was just somebody with 350k to throw in to a stock I see people chat about on Reddit. This is wild. Don’t look at the stock. It’s Amazon….it will be up a couple years from now no matter what happens shy of WW3. Even then it might be all good. Or join r/wallstreetbets As others are saying, it's Amazon, just hold it.

# Key Takeaways

* Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will deliver testimony to Congress, while other Fed officials are also expected to speak at other events this week.
* The May PCE report will show whether the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation continued its downward trend.
* FedEx, Nike and Micron are among the firms on the corporate earnings calendar.
* Investors will also watch for updates on existing home sales, consumer confidence and gross domestic product.

The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady last week. Now, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will explain the central bank’s views on the economy to legislators when he delivers his regularly scheduled testimony to Congress this week.

Central bankers have stood pat as they are concerned inflation will reignite in the wake of tariffs. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) for May should tell them more when it's released later in the week. Investors will also be watching for updates on first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP), housing market data, and the latest developments in consumer confidence. 

Earnings from shoe retailer Nike  (NKE), package delivery service FedEx (FDX), and chipmaker Micron Technology (MU) come as corporations continue to assess the impact that tariffs could have on their operations. And Tesla’s anticipated rollout of its self-driving robotaxi is likely to be on investors' minds this week.

# Powell Congressional Testimony Follows Rate Decision

On the heels of last week’s Federal Reserve meeting, Powell will testify before Congress to give lawmakers an update on the central bank’s views on inflation and the economy. Powell is scheduled to testify before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday and the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday. Several other Fed officials are also scheduled to deliver remarks during the week.

The hearings could provide some market-moving moments, especially as political allies of President Donald Trump may take the opportunity to grill Powell. Trump has criticized Powell for the central bank’s reluctance to lower interest rates, a complaint that could be echoed by some lawmakers.

Trump has pointed to lower inflation rates as a reason for the Fed to lower rates. Market watchers will get another look at inflation on Friday with the release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report for May. PCE is important because it’s the data the Fed looks at when gauging whether inflation is returning to its target rate of 2%. Inflation has been declining, with the PCE coming in just over the target rate in April. 

# Nike, FedEx, Micron Earnings in Focus 

Athletic apparel giant Nike, a member of the Dow 30, will lead corporate earnings this week with its scheduled update on Thursday. The struggling shoe maker warned during its prior quarterly report that tariffs could impact the company, coming as it reported declines in revenue and earnings. But analysts said the recent merger of Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Foot Locker (FL) could help Nike boost sales.

FedEx scheduled earnings on Tuesday come as the shipping stalwart warned of lower revenue and profits during its prior quarterly report. Investors watch FedEx earnings because they can provide a view of shipping volumes, which in turn can offer insight into the overall health of the economy, and especially on global trade.

Investors will also be watching Micron Technology’s scheduled report on Wednesday, which comes after the chipmaker pledged a $200 billion investment to boost semiconductor production in the U.S.

Tesla (TSLA) is tentatively scheduled to roll out its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, on Sunday, June 22, though product updates have been delayed in the past. Expect Tesla’s robotaxi to grab headlines and potentially move the EV maker’s stock throughout the week, especially if Sunday’s launch is delayed.

“Conflict” and actively bombing are different things. Some think none of this matters because of the war For the Markets, The problem with the war isn’t the actual war but the price of oil remaining elevated. The current admins entire thesis for keeping inflation down was offsetting it with cheap energy. If this war is prolonged inflation metrics with skyrocket thanks to oil prices no longer offsetting the rise of everyday goods. Plus the traffs, the tax bill is going to implode if Iran strikes back, and the U.S. debt to income problem. Markets will continue green. Very bullish. we’ve also had multiple administrations who’ve been pulling away from the Middle East publicly, had 9/11 as a scapegoat goat for most of it, and previous conflicts were more or less globally-approved (albeit waning support). 

A lot of the world is against Israel this time around and we forced our way into a non-US conflict. Anyone who believes that global perception doesn’t have strong ties to the market hasn’t been paying attention. I think trump is using the strike on iran to divert attention away from domestic socio-economic problems. For now clearly oil will spike, which will be a drag on inflation in the next Qtr, but it’s not clear there will be ramifications beyond energy stocks. Russia may give Iran nukes, they're likely closing the straight of Hormuz... Cheap oil was the only thing keeping inflation numbers in check. If the Hormuz closes and gas spikes, the CPI will be ugly. This is significantly different than random drone strikes. We’ve been drone striking targets all over the Middle East for the past 20 years.

First of all, I don't want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it reflects closing prices from June. 13 to June 20. 

It was a quiet and flat week. The S&P 500 lost 0.15%. However, Nasdaq gained 0.21% and Dow gained 0.02%.

Here are the S&P 500's week-by-week results,

May. 30 close at 5,911.69 - June 6 close at 6,000.36 🟢 (+1.49%)

June 6 close at 6,000.36 - June 13 close at 5,976.97 🔴 (-0.38%)

June 13 close at 5,976.97 - June 20 close at 5,967.84 🔴 (-0.15%)

🔸 Monday: The most important event was FOMC meeting in this week. On the other hand, Trump called for peace deal between Iran and Israel. The stock market opened higher more than 0.5%. During the session, we heard positive news about war. Iran wanted a ceasefire and resume to nuclear talks. The stock market closed higher around 1%. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: Before the session, retail sales and import/export price index data were released. These industrial datas came below expectations and it's a sign of economic weakness. Trump cut G7 trip due to Middle Easy situtation. He also said EU is not offering fair trade. As we know, when we heard negative news about tariffs, the stock market goes to negatively. The stock market opened lower. During the session, Trum said ""Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran"" and called ""unconditional surrender"" for Iran's. The stock market closed lower. 🔴

🔸 Wednesday: Sure, Iran's Khamenei rejected Trump's surrender call. The stock market opened slightly higher before the FOMC meeting. Silver hit the highest level since 2012 at $37. I'm following gold and silver, so I have not been writting about other precious metals like palladium. As expected, Fed held interest rate steady. Jerome Powell talked about many topics. He still wants to wait of result of tariffs. Also, the expected rate cut count dropped 2 to 1 in 2025. The S&P 500 closed down just 0.04%. 🔴

🔸 Thursday: Holiday.

🔸 Friday: Interestingly, Fed's Waller said central bank could cut rates as early as July. Sure, the stock market liked this and opened higher around 0.5%. However, during the session, Fed's Barkin said nothing urgent in data warranting a rate cut at this point. Also, Friday was Triple Witching Day which can create high volatility. As a result, the stock market lost its gains and closed lower. 🔴

Despite the FOMC meeting, it was a fairly quiet week. CME FedWatch Tool (you can find via Google search) currently shows no rate cut expected in 2025. As Trump mentioning, is Powell late? What do you think? How was your week?

1ldq1x5,2025-06-17,"Sunrun -35%, SolarEdge -30%, First Solar -16% as Senate Bill Cuts Green Incentives, EV Credit Ends Early
No paywall: [https://www.investors.com/news/solar-stocks-dive-senate-bill-cuts-solar-wind-energy-incentives/?src=A00220](https://www.investors.com/news/solar-stocks-dive-senate-bill-cuts-solar-wind-energy-incentives/?src=A00220)

Solar stocks such as Sunrun (RUN), SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) and First Solar (FSLR) plunged overnight after the newly released Senate budget bill would keep a full phase-out of solar and wind energy tax credits by 2028.

The GOP-led Senate Finance Committee late Monday unveiled changes to the Trump budget bill that passed the House, but left the wind-down of solar and wind incentives.

Sunrun stock dived 35.4% early Tuesday, with SolarEdge down 30.3%, Enphase Energy (ENPH) 19.9% and First Solar stock 16.3%. Array Technologies (ARRY) gave up 13.7%, Shoals Technologies (SHLS) 10.1% and Nextracker (NXT) 13.8%. Nextera Energy (NEE) lost 2.8%.

A decline in solar and wind projects could affect demand for battery storage. But Fluence Energy (FLNC) rose 3.%.

Tesla (TSLA) has a notable storage business under Tesla Energy while the Senate bill would end the $7,500 tax credit for EVs 180 days after becoming law. That's vs. the House's end-of-2025 cut-off. Tesla stock dipped 0.6% in premarket action.
These clowns would have us back to leaded gas if they could make a penny off it.  This kills momentum for clean energy stocks. Incentives were their backbone. What’s surprising is how mispriced this obvious outcome was. Frustrating, but it was to be expected. I think it was mostly 'priced in' already with the european companies Clean energy ruins the profits made off fossil fuels, markets cant have that. gasoline is a reoccurring sale, we need consumers burning fuel then they pay for it again. drill baby drill Hahaha sunrun fuck you",42,0.9,8,0,callsonreddit,stockmarket,['TSLA'],sunrun 35 solaredge 30 first solar 16 senate bill cuts green incentives ev credit ends early paywall solar stocks sunrun run solaredge technologies sedg first solar fslr plunged overnight newly released senate budget bill would keep full phaseout solar wind energy tax credits 2028 gopled senate finance committee late monday unveiled changes trump budget bill passed house left winddown solar wind incentives sunrun stock dived 354 early tuesday solaredge 303 enphase energy enph 199 first solar stock 163 array technologies arry gave 137 shoals technologies shls 101 nextracker nxt 138 nextera energy nee lost 28 decline solar wind projects could affect demand battery storage fluence energy flnc rose 3 tesla tsla notable storage business tesla energy senate bill would end 7500 tax credit evs 180 days becoming law thats vs houses endof2025 cutoff tesla stock dipped 06 premarket action clowns would us back leaded gas could make penny kills momentum clean energy stocks incentives backbone whats surprising mispriced obvious outcome frustrating expected think mostly priced already european companies clean energy ruins profits made fossil fuels markets cant gasoline reoccurring sale need consumers burning fuel pay drill baby drill hahaha sunrun fuck
1ld5pil,2025-06-16,"US and UK say they’ve cemented a trade agreement that Trump calls fair for both nations
No paywall: [https://apnews.com/article/trump-starmer-trade-deal-beef-g7-52bea5eb383a0b45d0d83e1982d277bf](https://apnews.com/article/trump-starmer-trade-deal-beef-g7-52bea5eb383a0b45d0d83e1982d277bf)

President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Monday that they are signing a trade deal that will slash tariffs on goods from both countries.

The deal does not include tariffs on steel, an especially important piece of bilateral trade. Instead, talks are still going on about whether steel tariffs will be cut to zero as planned in the provisional agreement.

Trump and Starmer announced in May they’d struck an agreement that would slash U.S. import taxes on British cars, steel and aluminum in return for greater access to the British market for U.S. products including beef and ethanol.

But it did not immediately take effect, leaving British businesses uncertain about whether the U.K. could be exposed to any surprise hikes from Trump.

British businesses, and the U.K. government, were blindsided earlier this month when Trump doubled metals tariffs on countries around the world to 50%. He later clarified the level would remain at 25% for the U.K.

Starmer said Monday that the trade agreement is “in the final stages now of implementation, and I expect that to be completed very soon.”

Trump said the deal is “gonna produce a lot of jobs, a lot of income.”
Wait haven’t they already made a deal a month ago? That was the concept of a deal. So how much tariffs am I going to have to pay now, that I didn't have to pay before? He doesn’t respect his own signed agreement so they might as well sign whatever he wants. Next year he will say the President in charge that signed it is an incompetent. Exactly. Now *this* is an almost final draft of a treaty that will be subject to the whims of the president and his tweets so long as he's in office. Which is effectively as reassuring to business as the agreements that existed in the weeks before he started indiscriminately tariffing everyone because of ""emergencies"". No, that was the concept of the concept. This is the actual concept *subject to how Trump (Putin) feels on any given day*. It seems to be the same deal, just with a few more questions answered. Of course, a trade deal with the UK, a country with whom the US already has a trade surplus, isn’t exactly that big of an accomplishment. They’re slashing tariffs for both countries? I thought Trump said the UK was ripping us off and taking advantage of us? How does lowering the tariffs on them stop them from taking advantage of us? Your president needs another parade in autumn :)) Parades are expensive! Because Trump is full of shit.

According to data from the U.S. Trade Representative for 2024, U.S. goods exports to the United Kingdom were about **$79.9 billion**, while U.S. goods imports from the United Kingdom came in at roughly **$68.1 billion**.

[**ORCL (Oracle)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ORCL&p=d)\-Had a massive run after earnings, going from 170 -> 220. Mainly interested on the short side of this due to the Iran/Israel conflict and oil surging and affecting all stocks on the market. Was interested in a short on the overnight exchanges yesterday. Watching $220 level. Also likely affected by Meta's superintelligence push and signal to continue spending in AI space.

[**SATS (EchoStar)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SATS&p=d)\-Trump urged EchoStar and FCC to resolve spectrum license dispute. This happened at the close on Friday but it seems this won't hold up the move completely (currently $24 vs $27). DirecTV terminated its agreement to acquire EchoStar's satellite television business last year over a failed debt-exchange offer. The FCC told EchoStar it was investigating the company's compliance obligations to provide 5G service in the U.S. (due to its buildout extension and mobile-satellite service).

Mainly looking for escalation, since the conflict has been signaled to last weeks, I will likely not do anything in this until escalation occurs. Middle Eastern conflict (especially between countries) drive energy costs up and gold/vol rallies during risk-off events (like war). Not an immediate trade worth looking at today, likely this will happen during OVERNIGHT or afterhours.

The big C is already near ATH, so I'm interested in seeing if we're able to make a significant move today.

There's a lot on the domestic calendar this week. But investors and the world are watching global affairs, too.

Meanwhile, several market-driving events are due in the coming days. The Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, consumer spending data, and possible news on President Donald Trump's tariffs headline the week. Thursday's Juneteenth holiday will mean a break from trading.

The Fed will hand down another decision on interest rates this week, with a decision scheduled for Wednesday. The coming weekend could see Tesla providing a significant update on the direction of the electric vehicle maker.

Did consumers in May continue to prop up the economy? Tuesday's U.S. retail sales will make it clear whether strong spending levels continued, while housing construction data will provide insight into whether builders are catching up with lagging inventory levels. Investors will continue to watch for trade developments as negotiations continue between U.S. officials and key trading partners.

It’s a light week for corporate earnings, highlighted by expected reports from homebuilder Lennar, accounting firm Accenture, grocery chain Kroger, and online used car seller CarMax.

# Fed Interest-Rate Decision Comes Amid Increasing Pressure for Cuts

Fed officials have said they are keeping rates steady amid a strong labor market as they monitor inflation data for signs that Trump’s tariffs are driving up prices.

But the pressure is on the Federal Reserve after May inflation data came in lower than economists expected. Despite comments from President Donald Trump urging the Fed to make a one-point cut, investors don't expect the central bank to take action when its two-day meeting concludes on Wednesday.

The CME FedWatch Tool, which measures fed funds futures to determine the path of interest rates, indicates that traders overwhelmingly believe that Fed will keep rates at their current levels in June. They also don't expect the central bank to move rates at its late July meeting.

After the meeting concludes on Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will provide more insight into the central bank’s view on the economy and interest rates when he takes media questions.

On Tuesday, retail sales figures from May will provide another barometer of the economy's health Consumer spending makes up about two-thirds of the U.S. economy. Meanwhile, housing data will also be scrutinized as affordability issues continue to depress home sales. The latest homebuilder confidence reading on Tuesday will show if construction industry officials see improvements coming in the market, while Wednesday’s housing starts data will indicate whether construction levels are rising amid a need for more housing inventory.

# Tesla Robotaxi Rollout Could Come as Early as Sunday

After months of waiting, investors could soon get a key update from electric vehicle maker Tesla (TSLA). CEO Elon Musk said in a recent social media post that the company could roll out its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, as early as Sunday, June 22. ""We are being super paranoid about safety, so the date could shift,"" Musk wrote.

The introduction of the company's robotaxi service could be a key moment for Tesla, which is banking on artificial intelligence (AI) and self-driving vehicles to become the transportation technologies of the future. Tesla is well-positioned to lead the market in the emerging technology, analysts have concluded, with Goldman Sachs writing that the EV maker could have a leg up on the competition through its ability to train self-driving through its AI development and to quickly scale production levels of the technology.

Despite a light corporate earnings schedule this week, investors will still get some expected updates from noteworthy companies.

Lennar’s (LEN) expected report after the bell on Monday follows the homebuilder's warning of weakness in the housing market in the prior quarter.  The scheduled Friday reports from accounting firm Accenture (ACN) and online car seller CarMax (KMX) will be posted in the shadow of both companies' lower-than-expected profits in the prior quarter.

Help me with a hypothetical: suppose Trump fires Powell and gets away with it and puts in a lackey. And further, that he fires any other people on the commission who won't play ball so that he gets his way.

What would happen in the event of a sudden one-point cut in the manner that he's been demanding? Line goes up? Line goes down? Line goes up briefly, and then down? How do you think that would play out in foreign markets? Trump cannot fire others on the commission. If he did so it would be like me firing the CEO of my company.

He would be ignored. These people have 12 year terms. They aren’t going to let their legacy be Banana Republicing the dollar and treasuries in order to impress one of a long line of presidents they will probably deal with. If Trump fires Powell, the markets go down. They will then come back but not as high as were. Once those rates drop markets shoot up higher than is reasonable then come down but will still be higher than pre rate drop. Honestly could go much higher. Markets are a casino. People are greedy and markets could go much higher. Even though a premature drop in interest rates could cause problems later, markets will still go up until there is evidence of those problems. But no one knows anything really. Everything seems obvious in hindsight, but it never is in foresight. High inflation is an economy killer No mention of Japan's interest rate decision tomorrow.

Yen carry trade is a topic that any cautious investor should always be aware and keep track over. Energy is definitely a major weak spot in the European economy. I doubt we can speak of an oil/energy crisis yet. In 2022 there was a perfect storm with the Ukraine invasion and slow investment because of covid. The damage that was done this weekend on Irans oil production is enough to cause a serious spike, but not in the neighbourhood of where it was it was back then. Probably because the dollar also keeps declining. We'll have to see if the fighting endures this week... If Trump fires Powell.....and he will, the economy and inflation will take a big turn for the worse. The economy is on shaky ground as it is. If interest rates drop the National debt  payment gets a smaller payment towards the debt....less interest  collected  equals less capital  put forth.
 Inflation is already right around the corner and the Fed has already hinted at two rate cuts, but just not now.  
Big business roots for rate cuts but it's no savior to our economy How the hell the future is green? Israel and Iran shooting at each other and yet the market is green af. What is this a joke? > He would be ignored.

I don't see that you have any reason to believe that. He should have been ignored when he fired the FTC members, but because he had installed a lackey as chairman they are being kept out of the building. So those FTC members are forced to sue to recover their positions. And that's a long process, and in the meantime Trump gets what he wants. Do we still see European stocks beating USA this year in the context of the Israeli Iran conflict?

Now this might be delusional to many, but food orders shows high transient population to key locations and hence activity. I can rely on such info that can impact stock markets as a precursor - may be I wouldn’t have bought that NVDA call after all. Right? 
This week? This has been known for decades Gen Z is finding out for the very first time, so therefore so is everyone else. Insane to think the Pentagon hasn’t learned their lesson with this. This has been an issue for decades now. Can't they just like, pay the cafeteria staff OT hours Right? I was about to say, this is a pretty well known thing. ....and officials know this.

I can't ""verify"" this explicitly, but every year or so I see somebody online saying ""I live near (White House, Pentagon, etc.) and I see a lot of deliveries happening!! Something going down!!""

...and nothing unusual happens. On the surface, you might say these people are lying or don't know what they are talking about. I believe them, actually. It makes total sense for officials to know this and purposely have food brought in every once and a while to ""normalize"" this behavior, so nobody can be tipped off.

On top of that, with the level of political journalism and the internet...things usually don't stay ""top secret""much anymore. Before big operations, or world events, some reporter somewhere puts out a ""stay tuned, something is happening"" report anyway. So, the idea that you can break codes at looking at pizza orders would only work aftter the initial rumblings.

And, when things actually NEED to be top secret, only people who need to know are aware. If you need to tell the entire Pentagon ""guys, order pizza, we will be working late..."", your secret operation won't stay secret for long.


TLDR; there is truth to this, but trying to discern anything meaningful from pizza orders overestimates your sluething capability, and underestimates public officials. From what i read years ago, it was such a well known thing that they started taking precautions when ordering food like having people pick it up and making several smaller orders.

These companies are left holding up the stock market. 
If they fall, the entire market falls. And it’s the opposite if they all go up the whole market goes up. But the chart tells a different story of the recent trend. They are going up but rest of market is going down. 
Here is what i think of the stocks left holding up the market. 

AAPL - weakness in innovation, losing growth

MSFT - might be overbought here

META - good ad business but questionable ai product profitability 

NFLX - high pe might give back massive gains its had

NVDA - ai sales increase already priced in. everyone says 170 eoy yet price is stalling. People relying on eoy to save them usually not a good thing. 

AMZN - aws has competition with new datacenter companies emerging. Needs to take on more debt just to maintain its margin intensive shipping business 

GOOG - losing search dominance, ai is good but not perfect yet, to maintain ai dominance intensive spending must happen will affect earnings

COST - taking a hit from tarrifs, it had a monster run and might give back a lot of gains

TSLA - lead roles stepping down, doesn’t look good for promises of products happening. 

We're always due, just no one knows when. On this sub, there’s a potential crash on a weekly, maybe daily, basis. Definitely maybe Probably.  But the market has been shockingly resilient over past few years to major disturbances. I'd keep playing the long term game, though. https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFuckingValue/s/vBfgbGUHzV

1lb4fcs,2025-06-14,"[ORCL] Larry Ellison's customer: ""We will take all the capacity you have wherever it is""
\[Edit: reposted images in higher resolution\]

I view Oracle’s (ORCL) post earnings market rally as an extension of the company’s premium valuation. The FY’25 report assured investors that the company is delivering, which is likely contributing to an extrapolation of success estimates for the company.

Summarizing my valuation below, I estimate an intrinsic value for Oracle of around $324 or $113 per share with projected revenues of $180B by the end of my 10-year forecast period. I also expect the company to maintain momentum and increase its operating margin to 35% by 2030 via cross-selling to new customers and upgrading its infrastructure to an autonomous cloud. In my view, the current rally is pricing the fundamentals above a 5-year premium which is too much of a risk.

https://preview.redd.it/06gv1ayj3v6f1.png?width=1037&format=png&auto=webp&s=04901d7c65221ad6bdb50b98fb9f282285c21fcb

At these price-levels I suspect that many investors \[including myself\] may have missed the boat on Oracle, and that is ok.

# Oracle Is Entering A Growth Upcycle

In Oracle’s FY 25 earnings call, they outlined their move to ramp up cloud infrastructure capacity in order to meet an unprecedented $138B worth of remaining performance obligations – A number which is expected to continue growing.

Oracle’s chairman, Mr. Ellison noted that they recently got an order that said

*“We will take all the capacity you have wherever it is.”*

While the statement is true, keep in-mind that it’s also a well-crafted pitch to investors.

The company posted a record $57.4B FY ‘25 revenue, up 8% from the $52.96B in 2024, with the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure \[OCI\] contributing 74%. The company expects to break out of its single digit growth rate, and has guided for a >16% revenue growth in 2026.

https://preview.redd.it/h8tnim8yzu6f1.png?width=822&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe5be3280a2c2bea4a2b337bfd9d6c2e25fe0894

There is currently a supply constraint for cloud infrastructure across the industry, and as long as AI applications are producing meaningful demand I expect the revenue growth for Oracle to persist. In my model, I will pull the revenue growth line forward for the next 4 years, but I do expect normalization after that and revert to single digit growth.

As you can see from the image below, the problem I have with Oracle is that revenues did not meaningfully improve prior to 2022 i.e. when AI entered the scene.

https://preview.redd.it/v8alsu553v6f1.png?width=1039&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a6fa899bdd9d32d43eb57aa51ec7b4c38607f86

In my view, the pre-2022 stagnation was a reflection of a brand-name impact from the past that kept customers away from Oracle’s products. Further, AWS and other cloud vendors provided viable alternatives, drawing market share. However, Oracle now has a chance to reinvent itself as more customers are steered into their cloud due to the lack of supply among cloud peers.

# Going All In On The Cloud

The company has invested $21.2B in capex, primarily consisting of infrastructure for the cloud business. For 2026, Oracle is intending to ramp up capex to over $25B.

The company is making a large bet on the cloud, and is even increasing leverage by around $5.6B to fund the projects. They will likely further increase debt levels in order to build their data centers, but I see this as an opportunity to positively recapitalize the company and maximize returns. For reference, Oracle currently has some $115B in debt, representing a Debt to Equity \[market value\] ratio of 18.6%. In my view, the company has room to increase this ratio and taking on more debt to fund a high-demand business is the right move.

# Oracle’s Pitch To AI Demand: The Vector Database

The fundamental product for Oracle is the database. Everything that oracle does, ties in some way to their database products with the core being relational (table) databases such as MySQL. Over time, the company has launched products that complement their database products by offering a place to host their database - such as the cloud, and creating software products from the database such as their ERP/CRM products.

Note that alongside the database, Oracle provides all the standard cloud products such as compute, storage, and their derivatives.

Now with the rise of AI demand, Oracle is optimizing the database for use of AI applications. This comes in the form of a vector database (highly recommended Fireship's YT video on vector databases) that is able to store data by similarity via embeddings, allowing AI applications to draw additional context from the database when the user makes a query.

https://preview.redd.it/uhv4ndf10v6f1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=85dae7283c5e4d350e6be0c42f835ff3709d6126

Oracle is pitching the vector database as a way for customers to increase the efficacy of their AI model, as well as a completely private product that can be accessed in the cloud. This enables customers to use their own proprietary data for context so that the AI model can produce tailored results. Oracle is not the only vector product on the market, and the space has seen a surge of innovation, but the company does offer database privacy features that are key to customers with proprietary data.

In my view, it will be a tight race between all cloud providers as they innovate in rapid succession. While Oracle holds the rights for MySQL and lends them under license agreements, competitors offer the open-source alternatives such as Postgresql - a highly scaleable relational database \[with many plugins, including for vector data\]. These alternatives are offered and supported in all large cloud providers such as AWS, Google Cloud, etc. This is why I don’t expect Oracle to maintain any persistent technological edge, and that their primary revenue driver will be the supply shortage for cloud infrastructure.

About a year ago, I was in a cloud presentation event. After the keynotes, we were chatting around with people. Most of the programmers shared their experience with either AWS or Google, and there was only 1 person that pitched Oracle cloud. He was a bit more on the eccentric side, but made a compelling argument about the price to performance for OCI. In the future, I expect OCI to go much more mainstream among the development community, developers to start experimenting, and later pitching their managers for OCI.

However, at the end of the day Oracle’s largest revenue contributors will continue being enterprise-level companies, so a bet on Oracle is a bet that these companies are going to need cloud & database products and a direct line of support.

# Valuation

Using the assumptions and updated numbers, I have constructed an unlevered DCF model for Oracle:

* Revenue growth 20%, 25%, and 20% in the next three years respectively. Converging on the riskfree rate after that. This results in revenues of $180B at the end of my forecast period, up some 3x from 2025.
* An increase in profitability after the infrastructure ramp due to moving an increasing portion of infrastructure from gen. 2 cloud to an autonomous cloud.
* Total reinvestment \[net of depreciation\] around $20B in the next 2 years.
* Negative free cash flows during the ramp period, up to 46B in year 10.
* Low, 8.5% cost of capital from the outset reflecting the stability of the organization.

https://preview.redd.it/s3bzxvh93v6f1.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdd8aa0fb5d4daa040fc0a39ed444216b8b7804b

The sum of present value comes up to $421, netting out debt and cash, I get an intrinsic value of $324 or $113 per share for the company.

While the debt is a great financing vehicle for CapEx investment, it still weighs on the final valuation and is reducing the intrinsic value by some $100B.

# Pricing At Maturity

Using the forecasts from my model, I estimate that Oracle will be able to produce around $46B in free cash flows by the end of my 10-year forecast period. At a 2035 20x FCF multiple, the forward pricing comes up to $920B. Discounting at a 8.5% rate back 10 years, I get a pricing of $407B or **$142** per share.

`[920 / 1.085^10 = 407]`

By comparing both approaches we see that despite being overvalued at the current price levels, the value of the equity may rise by an 8.5% CAGR for 10 years to reach a $920B valuation. I did not assign any excess returns to the company as I expect increased competition in the cloud infrastructure space, database innovation, and the ERP software.

My $920B pricing is indicative of just how far investors can take Oracle’s valuation with the *generous* assumption that they can wait out the price to value gap. In my view, if Oracle breaks above this point, its fundamentals will be fully priced-in for the next 10 years.

# Conclusion

As of the time of writing, Oracle has a market cap of $618B, indicating that the market is ahead of my $324B valuation by around 7 years, and 5 years ahead of my $407B pricing. This indicates that investors need to hold the company for 5-7 years before the fundamentals break-even on the current price.

In my view, 3 years is an acceptable premium for quality companies, and barring any major flaws in my predictions, I view the risk to return asymmetry to be unfavorable at the current price.

Using my intrinsic value, the 3-year premium range for the company would come up to $144 per share, which is where I would consider Oracle to be a portfolio candidate.

`[113 * 1.085^3 = 148]`

The company is on a growth uptrend, and I expect it to continue for at least the next 2 years. AI may not be the only growth driver, and Oracle may sustain higher growth rates from its ERP software applications, as well as the opening up of dormant cloud demand for industries such as the military industry with the digitization of drones. Because of this, it is likely that the company will continue trading 3 to 5 years ahead of the fundamentals.

Investors that had a position in the company pre-earnings may consider taking profit after the company shows a slowdown in its acceleration, which may take at least a few quarters. Finally, going short on the stock may not be wise despite the price being ahead of the fundamentals.

# Risks

* The cloud infrastructure demand cycle may be shorter than expected, and many customers may abandon their AI projects or switch to ready-made solutions by some of the large vendors. Innovation avenues in this space may become more narrow and the demand for training compute will alleviate the supply shortage.
* Large AI vendors may produce breakthroughs in the amount of compute required for AI inference and training, significantly changing the demand curve. Google, Microsoft and most other large vendors are already releasing light versions of their models \[phi, gemma\].
* Oracle had a 10-year period with little meaningful growth pre-2022 which was partly driven by the innovation of database technologies from cloud competitors. If the company fails to maintain a unique aspect to their value proposition \[such as the mentioned private cloud\], it will find it difficult to keep up growth after the next few years.
* Customers may switch their database preferences from a centralized and highly scalable database like MySQL to smaller and localized versions such as SQLite. MySQL is a good fit for large companies, but there is a case to be made that SMBs do not require the scale of a database of Oracle’s caliber. The development community has been increasingly experimenting with smaller and open-source alternatives, which may lead to more pitches from developers to managers to switch to lighter alternatives.
* Oracle’s software and infrastructure is sometimes reported to be difficult to work with. This has been a drag on the company’s brand reputation for software and databases alike.
* AI is great at producing insights from technical documentation, which enables easier implementations & troubleshooting of alternative databases, eroding Oracle’s support services moat.
* Oracle will keep maintaining pricing power relative to the quality of their competitors – if at any point competitive databases become higher quality or less risky to adopt, we will likely see an increase in the quality of Oracle products.
OP, is this driven by the forced push of on prem enterprise customers to Oracle Fusion cloud? Still hold all my Oracle shares purchased in 1995 with no plan to sell 😎 I didn't catch a breakdown on how customers are migrating within the stack during the earnings call. 

The growth driver was noted as an increased need for cloud capacity, primarily for A.I. workloads, not existing customer workloads. The extra debt is ok, debt to equity is 18%, and the company is stable enough to rack it up to 30%. It would be better if they recapitalize in a lower rate environment, but even if they don't they will make returns on their capex. 

The only problem is that they need much higher returns to justify the current $617B market cap. Bro you must work as an analyst or have a CFA because I bet half the people on this sub will have no idea what they are reading, they just see stonk market go up = green curlor Thanks, I have some experience, but started as a hobbyist.

Some people don't care, but if they do, most can at least intuitively understand what is going on. 

My pitch boils down to Oracle will make more money because there aren't enough servers to run AI models on.  
  
Heck, maybe I shouldn't have complicated it in the first place :) what would you rate microsofts current true value to? I was expecting 200$ to be a good price seeing how other big tech is valued Is it factoring the $500B Stargate investment?

I’m ALL IN with ORCL and NVDA for the last 5 years. Each pay check, each bonus. Partly, ORCL management were pressed multiple times about Stargate during the earnings call and refused to give any hint/direction. It seems that the specifics of obligations and rewards are still being discussed. My take is that ORCL will be expected to make capex contributions \[which I consolidated as my total reinvestment estimate\] to expand data centers and will receive some form of contracts or government benefits as kickback - Everybody wins.

This is purely my speculation!

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [Air India Plane Crash ](https://apnews.com/live/air-india-plane-crash-ai171-ahmedabad-london)

[**BA (Boeing)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BA&p=d)\-Air India Flight AI171, a Boeing 787‑8 Dreamliner carrying 242 people from Ahmedabad to London, crashed shortly after takeoff on June 12, 2025 due to suspected bird strikes. Boeing shares plunged \~8% pre‑market as this marks the 787’s first ever crash with total loss. Mainly interested to see if there is some kind of selloff and subsequent recovery. BA always has some selloff when there is a plane crash, but frankly this appears to be a bird strike so mainly a fault of the pilots and not the company (for what we know now).

[**OKLO (OKLO)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OKLO&p=d)\-Announced a tentative U.S. Air Force contract to provide small modular reactor-based nuclear power to Eielson AFB in Alaska. This stock broke ATH yesterday, one of the more interesting levels I was looking at was $60. They immediately did an offering of $400M in stock afterwards, so looking out to see if there's a continued selloff and we cool off.

[**GME (GameStop)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME&p=d)\-Announced a proposed private placement of $1.75B in convertible senior notes after earnings; Wedbush released a note this morning questioning whether GME can replicate MSTR's BTC strategy. Immediately sold off and I'm interested in the $20 level if there's any kind of bounce. Not interested in any sort of long-term hold, more of a day trade/scalp.

1l8tc5g,2025-06-11,"Is the AI Frenzy Far from Over? Which Concept Stocks Are Reaching New Highs?
There has been a chart circulating online comparing the stock trends of Cisco vs. Nvidia. The sharp decline in $NVIDIA (NVDA.US)$'s stock price at the beginning of the year brings back memories of Cisco in the 1990s. After the burst of the dot-com bubble, companies like $Cisco (CSCO.US)$ and $Intel (INTC.US)$ saw their stock prices plummet. Investors want to know if Nvidia will face the same fate.

However, there has been a new twist in this chart. On April 30th, a pivot occurred with Microsoft's earnings; Nvidia also continued its upward trend when it announced a series of contracts from the Middle East.

The quarterly earnings released by Microsoft sends a clear message: the AI juggernaut rolls on, at least for now. Since the earnings release, Microsoft's stock price has soared over 17%. This news has been comforting to the entire AI sector, proving that companies are not disappointed in this highly hyped technology. Microsoft's strong performance has also led the market to infer an increased demand for Nvidia chips.

Additionally, with Trump and bin Salman endorsing the US-Saudi AI deal, Nvidia said it will sell hundreds of thousands of AI chips in Saudi Arabia, with a first tranche of 18,000 of its newest ""Blackwell"" chips going to Humain, an AI startup just launched by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. Nvidia's stock price has recovered from its sharp decline at the beginning of the year.

**Is the AI frenzy far from over?**

Recent trends in AI concept stocks indicate that the AI ""stock market fuel"" is far from running out. On Monday, $Applied Digital (APLD.US)$ announced a transformative $7 billion, 15-year AI data center lease agreement with $CoreWeave (CRWV.US)$, a leading AI hyperscaler. Applied Digital saw its stock price skyrocket by 48.46%, closing at $10.14. Meanwhile, CoreWeave's stock has more than doubled since the start of the year.

$Tempus AI (TEM.US)$, a ""precision medicine"" company that leverages artificial intelligence to better treat patients, Shares soared 15% on Monday. Late Friday, the company announced an initiative it calls Fuses, a program designed to transform therapeutic research and build the largest diagnostic platform using its novel foundation model. Since the beginning of the year, Tempus AI's stock has surged by 88%, while the telehealth firms $Hims & Hers Health (HIMS.US)$ has skyrocketed nearly 135%.

**$Palantir (PLTR.US)$'s stock price has also continued to reach new highs, rising 74% since the beginning of the year. The up-and-coming AI firm $BGM is up over 88% so far this year.**

Furthermore, $Broadcom (AVGO.US)$ will release its second-quarter financial report after the market closes on June 5th. Wall Street expects the chipmaker to report growing revenue and profits fueled by demand for AI chips. Broadcom may soon become the first big tech stock to break historical highs. Its current stock price is $248.71, just under 1% lower than the peak of $250.45 in December last year.
Is that written by Chatgpt? 
It does very much feels like written by an AI than a person. While comparisons between Nvidia and Cisco during the dot-com era are interesting, today's AI ecosystem is structurally different. Unlike the speculative bubble of the 1990s, companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Palantir are backed by real demand, enterprise contracts, and global infrastructure needs. The AI rally may face volatility, but recent developments from Microsoft’s earnings to the US-Saudi AI initiatives suggest the long-term runway remains intact. Concept stocks like APLD, Tempus AI, and CoreWeave indicate that the AI story is expanding beyond chips into verticals like medicine, data centers, and national strategies. The frenzy might cool in phases, but the structural trend seems far from over. Palantir genuinely does have pretty sophisticated AI though... Quantum computing stocks are in hype Palantir is an AI stock in the same way McDonald's is a tech company because of its app. Internet boom ""ended and re-started"" before mid-2000

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\-More easing in Trump/Musk tensions, both have tweeted reconciliatory tweets earlier this morning and it seems their feud is at an end. Trump announced a 'done deal' in the rare earths deal, causing a small spike to the market premarket. The buying opportunity was the day of the tweets but obviously, still interesting to see if the Trump/Musk relationship can be completely repaired. It seems both sides are playing damage control and trying to repair the rift. There's been huge discontent from Musk due to Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" but we've moved from 325->275 ->335. MASSIVE move and trade of the month.

[**OUST (Ouster)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OUST&p=d)\-Premarket announcement that the US Department of Defense approved its OS1 digital lidar sensor for use in unmanned aerial systems. Most of the move occurred premarket, but will be watching to see if we make another leg higher- the daily chart looks near parabolic if we move up again today/tomorrow with a move from 7.50 to 20 in the past month.

[**CRWV (Coreweave)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&p=d)\- Staying surprisingly resilient at \~$160, we've also seen upward momentum an hour before the open (154->160). Overall nothing too compelling for a short unless we rocket past 160 to something ludicrous, this has stayed up longer/stronger than CRCL so far more interested in this.

[**ASTS (AST SpaceMobile)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)\-Somewhat still hovering fairly high from Jeff Bezos posting a picture that implied a partnership. This has diverged from RKLB's move up, and is still hovering around $36. Nothing too compelling unless we make a leg higher. Again, nothing confirmed from Bezos or Amazon, so the move may fade if no formal announcement follows.

1l860me,2025-06-10,"IBM (NYSE: IBM) announces new quantum processor, plan for Starling supercomputer by 2029
* IBM on Tuesday announced a detailed roadmap to develop a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer called Quantum Starling.
* Part of the company’s plan involves the new IBM Quantum Nighthawk processor, which is set to release later this year, according to a blog post announcing the roadmap.
* Microsoft and Amazon announced quantum chips this year, following Google’s “Willow” rollout in December.

1l836bo,2025-06-10,"Scale+Meta/OpenAi+Apple... impact on Palantir?
Palantir has been positioning itself as the answer to all Enterprise's problems, but how could these partnerships affect that? 

I have been building a few apps recently, and I'm moving away from API calls to training an agentic ai. It's pretty easy for a person like me, with low level coding skills to achieve this. I can upload any number of files which will instruct it on how to begave, set guardrails etc. I imagine for a team of seasoned programmers it will be a lot easier and way more effective. These calls are cheap as hell too.

Seems to me that much of the 500+ P/E ratio for PLTR is based on their forward enterprise TAM. And if it becomes easier and much cheaper for companies to develop their own systems, TAM is surely affected.

Btw I am an og pltr holder and I still am on board, but just wondering what people think?
It’s not just about skill.    it’s more about a willingness to do evil and to publically embrace it.  


Palantir, in its name, signals a willing to be public about its willingness to sell technofacism.   It seems there are many out there who want to profit off of it.   These other companies they may have the ability to do what Palantir is doing but better; but are they willing?  And do they have , through Anduril a way to turn that data into “action”. Palantir is an obscure company..cant really pinpoint exactly what they do and how disruptive and original they are!just another government contractor profiting from tax payers, long life government contracts, forever! And it mostly sells labor, not software licenses or SaaS. Pretty sure the big tech companies have tried building their own in house version and failed.

Palantir isn't a new company, its over 20 years old. Building an operating system is pretty difficult, especially from the ground up. Don't think its going to be cheaper for any of the big tech companies to build an operating system than to lease one from palantir. Doesn't matter. Big P is riding the government tit now. I don't think you're factoring in just how fast agentic AI is moving things along. Look at what it could do last year vs this year. And then project that into next year. It's moving exponentially. What was a timeline of 20 years at the beginning of this century is now 18-24 months with agents + knowledgable engineers. I mean what you're saying is that in your dream scenario everything is going to be replaced in 10 years including humans...

In reality, there are always blockades and hurdles to pass. Innovation is incredibly fast until it hits a bottleneck. I don't think it's a dream scenario. I think Apple and Meta tried to ""do AI"" themselves, the same way they've been copying other people's shit for years; they realized they couldn't, because it's hard, and caved. They would be left in the dust otherwise. Meta likely will be anyway because, Zuck.

Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [Zuckerberg Recruits New Superintelligence AI Group At Meta](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-10/zuckerberg-recruits-new-superintelligence-ai-group-at-meta?srnd=homepage-americas)

[**CRWV**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&p=d)\-DA Davidson released commentary suggesting their pro forma had underestimated its debt situation while not properly accounting for borrowing costs. This stock is ridiculously run up since IPO (\~4x it's opening price). Daily setup doesn’t look like a clean short, but watching to see if it mimics CRCL’s recent surge at the open yesterday. Interested in seeing if it breaks the highs ($166). Obviously CRWV has a huge debt load due to their GPUs/training chips, but whether this will actually affect the stock price remains to be seen.

[**TSLA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\-Musk/Trump tensions have cooled down and Trump publicly stated that they will keep their White House Starlink. This happened about 30 mins before the close and caused TSLA to shoot up a little, and ASTS/RKLB to sell off. TSLA was extremely interesting the day of the feud, but currently I'm minorly long.

Has been on a tear for the past 3 days, might have topped out yesterday. Wasn't this watching this too closely because I was trading CRCL but still interested to see if this makes a higher leg up. Yesterday was the most interesting day for this and RKLB, but if this breaks highs again today then I'll be interested.

[**CRCL**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&p=d)\-Strong run post-IPO has made this the most interesting stock this week outside of TSLA. Very likely we topped out yesterday but watching for additional momentum. Keep in mind that this is mainly ""C"" money + the hype of a recent C stock and IPO success of CRWV that has propelled this higher (it is a solid business model as well)\_. I think the momentum in this has deflated (we surged briefly off the open and then sold off for most of the day).

Take a look at this chart.

Orange line = SPX  
Blue line = SPX without AAPL, MSFT, META, NFLX, NVDA, AMZN, GOOGL, COST

Now tell me honestly… is this really a bull market?

Or is it mostly tech bull market where tech names like Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix and Google and Amazon too... 

Because if you remove these 7 tech names plus Costco too, the rest of the market looks like it’s been going sideways or even rolling over hard. This ain't a healthy, broad-based rally. It’s basically just a handful of mega caps doing all the heavy lifting while the rest of the market is lagging behind big time. 

There are other few more stocks that have done well such PLTR and WMT and HOOD and UBER that are much at their ATH... Feels like everyone’s celebrating all-time highs, but under the surface it's a different story. 

https://preview.redd.it/d4yxscbwew5f1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=21b2b8b618e8a5bbe5537f2d1763fb6bf213270f

Most stocks aren’t even close to their highs. **Such as AMD, Paypal, Target, NKE, ADBE, ABNB a**nd many many more. Those big names are down big times from **50% or even 70%** more down from their **ATH**  
Even chinese stocks such as BABA and Bidu are down and trading at very low valuations...

Personally i would like to ask how can any average person who is coming hot in this market which might seem easy on surface but very to invest in because on one hand you are either investing in tech stocks that are highest gainers but at absurd valuations or betting on losers that haven't gained any momentum in this market even though stock market is at pretty pretty close to ATH. 

So again… is this really a bull market?
With so much manipulation occurring how can you classify it as anything based on history. Corruption at this level has never been a variable one can use to predict. If you exclude the teams that made the playoffs the rest of the league looks pretty mid. It’s a bull shit market This right here. We’re at levels of liquidity pulls we have never seen before. Thank A.I it’s not just big money this time. Why I ignore charts and stick to fundamentals. Nothing fundamentally supporting bullish sentiment other than trading that which shorts the market once euphoria has expired and effects of tariffs become shown through lagging economic data. It’s likely to be a sad summer for bulls Definition of projection👆 I'm not sure that's the fair analogy to a bull market right? Unless we are seeing the 'mega-corp' era unfold.

The 90s had to have more broad rally than this right? A president shilling a car in the white house was never in bing car until 🥭 showed up My assumption is that layoff will pick up very soon & inflation will remain sticky. I mean there is a downward revision of 95,000 employment for March & April. This is an early sign & employment is going down. With the tariffs that are still pressnt, inflation will not go down.

High inflation & unemployment will cause the economy to slow down in Q2& Q3. Elon musk himself admitted that tariffs will cause a recession in 2nd half of the year. So, I do expect a major drop in  stock market in Q3.

This run up will trap alot of retail buyers & institutional will be the real winner (as always) Look at Teslas' last financials and look at the stock... several companies are like this",405,0.87,294,0,SpiritBombv2,stockmarket,"['AAPL', 'AMZN', 'MSFT', 'NVDA', 'META', 'GOOGL']",actually bull market take look chart orange line spx blue line spx without aapl msft meta nflx nvda amzn googl cost tell honestly really bull market mostly tech bull market tech names like nvidia apple microsoft meta netflix google amazon remove 7 tech names plus costco rest market looks like going sideways even rolling hard aint healthy broadbased rally basically handful mega caps heavy lifting rest market lagging behind big time stocks done well pltr wmt hood uber much ath feels like everyones celebrating alltime highs surface different story stocks arent even close highs amd paypal target nke adbe abnb many many big names big times 50 even 70 ath even chinese stocks baba bidu trading low valuations personally would like ask average person coming hot market might seem easy surface invest one hand either investing tech stocks highest gainers absurd valuations betting losers havent gained momentum market even though stock market pretty pretty close ath really bull market much manipulation occurring classify anything based history corruption level never variable one use predict exclude teams made playoffs rest league looks pretty mid bull shit market right levels liquidity pulls never seen thank ai big money time ignore charts stick fundamentals nothing fundamentally supporting bullish sentiment trading shorts market euphoria expired effects tariffs become shown lagging economic data likely sad summer bulls definition projection im sure thats fair analogy bull market right unless seeing megacorp era unfold 90s broad rally right president shilling car white house never bing car showed assumption layoff pick soon inflation remain sticky mean downward revision 95000 employment march april early sign employment going tariffs still pressnt inflation go high inflation unemployment cause economy slow q2 q3 elon musk admitted tariffs cause recession 2nd half year expect major drop stock market q3 run trap alot retail buyers institutional real winner always look teslas last financials look stock several companies like
1l6nzx2,2025-06-08,"AMZN + ASTS = Global Sovereign Connectivity and Cloud Services
I've been thinking about some recent news, and I need to share this theory because it feels big for AST SpaceMobile ($ASTS). This is just me connecting some dots, but it looks like something major could be brewing between them and Amazon.

First, just this past Monday, Jeff Bezos met with Abel Avellan, the CEO of ASTS and Adriana Cisneros, the first major ASTS investor. Adriana later posted saying ""amazing things are happening at ASTS and Blue Origin, congrats Abel and Jeff!"" That alone is a pretty big deal – Bezos doesn't usually make those kinds of public appearances for nothing.

**Then, literally the next day, Amazon drops news about launching a completely new, ""Sovereign Cloud"" business in Europe.** What that means is it's a super secure cloud, totally separate, managed entirely by EU citizens within the EU, designed for governments and super sensitive data. It’s built for total control and independence for European clients. **Now, about a month ago, ASTS and Vodafone announced their own joint venture in Europe, called SatCo. And guess what they heavily emphasized? ""Sovereignty.""** This venture aims to provide 100% cellular coverage across Europe using ASTS's satellites, designed with European control and ""sovereign backhaul capabilities"" for both commercial and government use.

See the pattern? ASTS launched a ""sovereign"" solution specifically for Europe targeting governments and critical industries, and then RIGHT after the meeting with Jeff Bezos, Amazon/AWS announces a similar sovereign solution for Europe. That doesn't just happen randomly. **To me, it screams that these companies are talking, strategizing, and probably planning to work together to create an end-to-end ""sovereign"" digital solution.**

If Amazon's secure ""Sovereign Cloud"" needs ubiquitous, reliable, and sovereign connectivity everywhere in Europe (especially where cell towers can't reach, or for emergencies), then ASTS's ""Sovereign SatCo"" is the perfect, ready-made solution. Plus, it's no secret Bezos wants to compete with Elon Musk in space. **Starlink struggles with direct-to-phone, but ASTS has that tech locked down. Starlink struggles with respecting digital sovereignty in Europe--and is even a threat to digital sovereignty after what we saw in Ukraine and Russia. ASTS has the Solution, and Jeff Bezos/Amazon/AWS want to take advantage.**

My guess? **Amazon is looking to capitalize in this blatant weakness in Elon Musk's Starlink stretegy.** Amazon will integrate ASTS's unique satellite-to-phone network into its AWS offerings, especially for these high-stakes sovereign clients. **It makes total sense for Amazon to partner with ASTS to offer a complete, end-to-end ""sovereign"" digital solution, from the cloud to your phone, anywhere in Europe.** If this happens, it's huge for ASTS and Amazon. It's bad for Elon and Starlink/SpaceX.

Curious to hear everyone's thoughts.
If ASTS and Amazon (and perhaps by extension Blue Origin) team up, very bullish. What I would REALLY like to see is ASTS using both Blue Origin and Space-x together to launch satellites, getting the company to the point where they can put aside capx and start raking in cash flow sooner. I don’t really care to think deeper than that. Amazon's been pretty aggressive about expanding AWS globally, and having that satellite to phone backup for truly sovereign connectivity would be a solid differentiator. Plus Bezos probably sees an opportunity to get back at Musk in the space game after Blue Origin's struggles. The ASTS tech could give AWS something Starlink doesn't really offer yet They already are lol ASTS has another contract with SpaceX to launch more, so that's just not true. Plus they were used twice so that also isn't true. BO is also planned for way more than 1 launch. Most of their launches aren't happening this year.

They will be using SpaceX for launches of 4 and BO for launches of 8 BB2s. Interesting ideas, but I would say that we shouldn't get carried away just because the word ""sovereignty"" comes up. As a European citizen, we hear about it every day; it's a topic in all technical and technological fields, and European companies expect a lot from it! But you're right, Ast has the technology and a top team! MIMO is multiple input, multiple output, meaning that data usage can be distributed across multiple sats. 6G is higher frequencies of EM data transfer meaning more data can be sent. How much data asts will need to move with aws clouds? Thats seems a bit far fetched don't get carried away. AWS may be talking to ASTS about the AWS groundstation service, but ASTS services won't do much in terms of facilitating a sovereign cloud. ASTS hasn't used BO so far, but they will. ( at least 1 contract with them for launch )

As for SpaceX, it was used 1 time, last September. They are not on the menu for 2025 so far. 

SpaceX doesn't like ASTS, and clearly they don't want to help them any longer. Yeah, you aren't right about any of this.

Hi everyone,

  
I'm currently struggling to find a reliable source for accurate and up-to-date financial data on publicly traded companies. I've been checking multiple platforms like TradingView, Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, Investing and others, but the numbers often vary widely between them. Sometimes the data is incomplete, outdated, or even contradictory. Financial ratios based on these numbers end up being completely inconsistent. Analyst consensus estimates are also frequently missing or disregarded. It's becoming increasingly frustrating and confusing to navigate all these sources. 

Do you know of a trustworthy platform that provides consistent, verified, and timely financial reports and metrics?

1l69olm,2025-06-08,"What To Expect in Markets This Week: June 9-13, 2025
No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/expect-markets-week-may-inflation-090000203.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/expect-markets-week-may-inflation-090000203.html)

News from a tech giant, inflation data and earnings from a meme-stock legend are among the highlights of the week ahead in markets.

Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference opens the week with a keynote session from CEO Tim Cook scheduled for Monday. Cook will likely use the event to address the company's new products, services, and partnerships. Key companies in the growing artificial intelligence (AI) market are also scheduled to update investors on their financials during the week.

A U.S. inflation report scheduled for Wednesday could indicate whether President Donald Trump’s tariffs are beginning to have an effect on the economy. The news follows a healthy jobs report Friday.

After markets shook off trade tensions last week to bring the S&P 500 back above 6000, investors will keep an eye on tariffs as Trump’s deadline on trade deals approaches. At the same time, the Senate will continue to work toward passage of Trump’s “Big, Beautiful” budget bill amid increasing criticism from Tesla CEO and former Department of Government Efficiency Chief Elon Musk.

# Economists Look for Inflation’s Impact in May CPI Report

Wednesday’s expected release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be the first look at inflation from May. With a Federal Reserve meeting around the corner, the report could set the tone for the central bank as it faces pressure from Trump to lower interest rates. Fed officials are in their blackout period ahead of their next two-day meeting, which begins June 17.

Trump’s tariffs will be a key topic in Friday’s consumer sentiment report, which dropped for four straight months before leveling out in May. Consumers are consistently worried that tariffs will drive inflation higher, sending the closely watched survey to some of its lowest readings since the pandemic. As inflation has lately appeared in check, the freefall in sentiment may have hit bottom.

Note: I removed GME from the post and this comment. We'd need to actually have something that looks like a riot (because what occurred in the HD parking lot isn't it) and see people get injured or killed for this to not get met with shoulder shrugs. Probably, because people are so focused on things that don’t matter. LA riots, Trump vs Elon don’t matter unless you’re holding Tesla options.

Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [Musk Blinks First in Bitter Trump Feud That Cost Him $34 Billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-06/musk-blinks-first-in-bitter-trump-feud-that-cost-him-34-billion)

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Elon Musk/Trump were in a public feud/argument on Twitter yesterday, and the threat of TSLA's government contracts being cancelled was brought up by Trump. Looking for the second day trade in this- we saw TSLA go to a low of $275 yesterday, so I'm interested to see if we continue selling off or make at least some attempt at recovery. Trump/Musk are expected to speak today to ""cool things down"". This spat is mainly political, another issue to add along with the rest. Musk did threaten to stop work on the Dragon Capsule, Trump threatened to stop all of TSLA/SpaceX's government contracts, causing the stock to fall 50 points throughout the day.

[**VERA (Vera)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VERA&p=d)\- VERA fell 30% after competitor Otsuka reported superior Phase 3 trial results for its IgA nephropathy drug, sibeprenlimab, which achieved a 51.2% reduction in proteinuria compared to Vera's atacicept's 46% reduction. We had seen VERA actually spike up due to their drug report a few days back from $20 ->$37 on this news- it's possible that it'll just stay flat at pre-drug release price.

[**CRCL (Circle)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&p=d)\- Watching the $100 level for potential breakout or breakdown. I regret not writing a DD for this but I was taking a break. We opened at \~2.5x multiple to the original IPO price and surged past $100 briefly in the first few minutes of trading, we've stayed pretty strong/sustained up since then. I'm interested to see if we can stay fairly at this level. I'm mainly interested in this because CRCL is one of the first listed stable C's on a US listing, and we've seen HUGE interest in recent catalysts that are related to this space/industry.

[**ASTS (AST SpaceMobile)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)\- ASTS surged over 13% amid speculation of a potential partnership or investment from Amazon, following social media posts featuring AST's CEO and Jeff Bezos. AMZN is beginning commercialization of its Project Kuiper initiative, a satellite-based project that will deliver retail wireless broadband to Earth (competitor to Starlink). There was a research report released that speculates ASTS's RF wireless service could complement Kuiper's broadband technology, and therefore make sense for an acquisition by AMZN. Regardless of how plausible you think an acquisition this is, this was driven all by a single picture and speculation. So be careful of volatility if nothing happens.

Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) stock plummeted on Thursday as the very public fallout between its CEO Elon Musk and President escalated, with Trump eventually threatening to slash government contracts and subsidies key to Musk's various business interests.

Thursday's spat included Trump telling reporters in the Oval Office he was ""disappointed"" in Musk, while Musk [argued on X](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1930667528696828120) — the social media platform that he owns — Trump wouldn't have won the White House without his support.

""The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

1l47nzb,2025-06-05,"Tesla drops 13%+ as Musk-Trump feud erupts over EV mandate cuts and spending bill
No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-slides-as-disappointed-trump-musk-trade-insults-after-musk-bashes-megabill-161612293.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-slides-as-disappointed-trump-musk-trade-insults-after-musk-bashes-megabill-161612293.html)

Tesla (TSLA) stock extended a two-day slide on Thursday as the very public fallout between its CEO Elon Musk and President Trump escalated.

""I'm very disappointed, because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here, better than you people,"" Trump said to reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday. ""All of a sudden he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to have to cut the EV mandate.""

""Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will anymore. I was surprised,"" Trump added.

Tesla stock fell to session lows on Thursday afternoon as Musk reacted in real-time to Trump's comments, falling over 11% near 2:45 p.m. ET.

Musk posted on X, the social media platform he owns, in apparent response to Trump's comments: ""Whatever."" He continued aiming at the president and the bill in a subsequent barrage of posts over several hours.

That prompted another response from Trump, who posted on Truth Social, the platform that he owns. Trump said he ""asked"" must to leave his government post, charging that he was ""wearing thin."" He also seemed to question the purpose of Musk's department.

""The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!"" Trump wrote.

Trump's comments amounted to an extraordinary public rebuke of Musk, who went from Trump booster and Republican Party megadonor during the 2024 campaign, to the head of the Trump-created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) with a mission to cut spending.

Musk kicked off the complaints over the bill earlier this week, calling it a ""disgusting abomination"" on Tuesday. The billionaire ramped up his barbs on Wednesday, telling users on X to, ""Call your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL.""

The Wall Street Journal also reported that the strain between the two was amplified by the White House's move to nix the nomination of Jared Isaacman for NASA administrator. Musk, a close ally of Isaacman, had advocated for him to get the job, sources told the Journal.

Bloomberg reported that Musk's ire may also be directed at the fact that the federal EV tax credit is being phased out by the bill, as he fought hard to keep it in place as a key driver for Tesla's business.

The Big Beautiful Bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate, with a Congressional Budget Office estimation of its impact on the deficit adding fuel to Musk's line of argument.

The nonpartisan office projected the House-passed version of the bill would add $2.4 trillion to deficits over the next 10 years.

DOGE itself, once led by Musk, has been criticized for not producing the budgetary cuts Musk touted it could find — and the cuts it has produced have been deeply unpopular.

Musk's ties to the Trump administration had been seen as a boon for his broader business interests, given SpaceX's close work with NASA and regulatory levers the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could pull in getting autonomous driving rules in place for Tesla's robotaxi testing.

But demand weakness in the EU and recent protests at US Tesla showrooms have followed Musk's controversial foray into politics, causing some Tesla owners to become alienated by Musk, specifically by his right-leaning tendencies, DOGE, and outward support of President Trump.

Tesla's big robotaxi test is slated for June 12 in Austin. Much of the company's value is tied to whether it can fully unlock autonomous driving for robotaxi purposes and individual owners.

Meanwhile, Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Waymo continues to plow ahead and is essentially the leader in the space, accumulating 250,000 robotaxi trips per week.
lmao. Nothing else to say. Get fucked muskrat Wait, so *now* TSLA is being affected by reality? Not dropping customer sentiment, decreasing sales, toxic CEO, none of that meaningfully affects stock price. But a spat between the CEO and Trump and the price goes tumbling? 15%, and counting. This is insane and absurd. Again. God what if he gets deported Two rich, terminally online, emotional men, one with the backing of podcast grifters and one with the backing of twitter grifters, go to war.

1l3y036,2025-06-05,"The iShares Defense Industrials Active ETF (IDEF) is the BEST, most diversified defense sector ETF available, is actively managed, has the most robust and niche holdings unavailable in other defense ETFs. Read on for my assessment why if you are into defense, this should not be slept on.
One of the themes of 2025 has been Defense ETFs with the geopolitical tensions in the world today which saw the rise of Europe Defense ETFs earlier this year that diversified away from US defense ETFs. With BlackRock/iShares latest offering (IDEF), I document my reasons why I think IDEF should be a *must-have* for investors who want an ***actively managed and diversified investment in the Global defense sector.***

# Context:

* Prior to the launch of IDEF, there were only a several defense ETFs available for US investors which were also aerospace heavy (e.g. Boeing).
* The prominent ETFs which have had good performance are SHLD (Global X Defense Tech ETF) and for non-US investors, there was also DFNS (VanEck Defense UCITS ETF USD A).
* Recently, there have been EU-centric ETFs that came to prominence with the increased EU spending, such as EUAD (Select STOXX Europe Aerospace & Defense ETF), NATO (HANEtf The Global Defence ETF) and several others.

# The cons of the above:

1. Many of these ETFs have large concentration in aerospace companies rather than defense companies (e.g. Boeing),
2. Many of these also bloat with cybersecurity companies rather than defense companies (e.g. Crowdstrike, Palo Alto, Cisco),
3. High concentration and limited holdings. Particularly with the EU defense, you see high concentration in one to three companies (e.g. Rheinmetall, Thales, BAE, etc) which each hold an average of 10-15% weight in the portfolio, while ETFs such as DFNS are concentrated in 20-30 holdings,
4. With the prominence of Palantir, it also holds a high concentration in these ETFs of around 7-10%.

# What makes IDEF better and more well diversified:

1. It has approximately 120+ holdings, higher than any other Defense ETF,
2. The fund is actively managed, unlike majority of others which just track an index of companies thrown together to fit a theme,
3. Portfolio has exposure to South Korea, France, UK, Japan, Germany, Israel, Italy, Sweden, Canada, Australia, Singapore. The highest weight is just under 6% of all holdings (GE AEROSPACE, 5.58% as of 3 June)
4. The portfolio has the usual defense favorites such as Palantir, Thales, Rheinmetall, Rolls-Royce, Airbus and many more,
5. The portfolio also includes gems and companies that serve national defense infrastructure like Singapore Technologies Engineering Ltd (Singapore - 70% YTD), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd (Japan - 48% YTD), DroneShield Ltd (Australia - 117% YTD),
6. The portfolio also includes small exposures to potential high growth companies like Rocket Lab Inc, Archer Aviation, C3.ai, Redwire, Bigbear.ai,
7. Expense ratio is 0.55% which is in-line with other Defense ETFs but considered low when you consider this is actively managed compared to those that passively track an index or basket of companies.

# Downsides to the ETF:

* While this is currently the ETF which is the most diversified and has a large number of holdings, it is still US heavy at 59%.
* Being iShares/BlackRock, feels like there will always be the usual suspects such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin included.
* Current volume is low as the fund was only incepted on 19 May 2025, less than a month ago.

# How to address the downsides:

* To balance out the US heavy concentration, consider supplementing together with an EU defense ETF if you want more exposure to EU and less to US. There is no Asia/Oceanic ETF at the moment.
* To balance out the Boeing/Lockheed holdings, consider supplementing together with SHLD which does not hold these, and is arguably the 2nd best defense ETF available on the market.

1l3ikf4,2025-06-04,"Shiny Rocks Not Stocks - Financial Repression and the Bull Case for Metals

THE DEBT PROBLEM

The U.S. government has a debt problem. With debt-to-GDP levels approaching those last seen during World War II, and the largest twin deficit in U.S. history, we’re borrowing the illusion of prosperity with no real path to pay it back.

Every administration since Reagan has expanded deficits and financed them with debt, all while exporting inflation to developing nations through the “King Dollar” system and exploiting cheap labor abroad.

Now, debt levels are reaching extremes. Inflation remains sticky, and government revenues can’t keep pace with rising interest payments. The conditions are ripe for a return to financial repression—and with it, a global repricing of everything.

FINANCIAL REPRESSION

Definition: Keeping interest rates (yields) below the rate of inflation in order to quietly erode the real value of debt.
Translation: Inflate your way out—without telling anyone that’s the plan.

We’ve seen this playbook before. In the post-WWII era, financial repression was used to whittle down a massive federal debt load. It worked, but only because savers took the hit, real returns were crushed, and capital was locked inside the system.

INFLATION COMES IN TWOS—AND SO DOES FINANCIAL REPRESSION

In Charts 1 and 2, you can see that every time real yields turned negative (i.e., inflation was higher than the 10-year Treasury yield), a second wave of inflation followed.

Each of these second waves saw real yields go deeper into negative territory—and commodities outperformed equities, as seen in the GOLD/SPX ratio.

We already saw the first wave in 2020. Real yields hit historic lows after the fastest rate cuts in history collided with a global economic shutdown. The Fed panicked, inflation collapsed, and markets sighed in relief. But if history’s any guide, that was just round one.

We aren’t out of the woods. The second wave is often even worse.

THE GOLD/SILVER RATIO (GSR)

The gold/silver ratio is flashing a major signal. Gold has dramatically outperformed silver, with the ratio spiking back above 100.

Historically, the GSR hasn’t spent sustained time above 97. Each time we’ve entered a second inflation wave paired with financial repression, this ratio has corrected sharply—with silver catching up violently to gold.

This setup looks eerily similar to those previous cycles. Gold has moved first. Silver may be next, but this time it’s jumping from the roof with no parachute 🪂 

TLDR
Shiny rocks not stocks. NFA

	
Saudi Arabia has been selling their oil to the West for physical gold this whole time. Read it all here:

[Thoughts from ANOTHER - Part I](https://www.goldchartsrus.com/papers/ANOTHER.php) Compared with the stock bull market that is drained by inflation, the bull market in precious metals such as gold and silver is better able to preserve and increase value in an environment of financial repression with high inflation and low interest rates 5000 year old meme coin… Yup and that shiny rock has been outperforming SPX since 2001. Check the last slide too, it’s the only thing thats maintained it’s purchasing power when compared to the average hourly wage. It beat stocks in that regard as well and the only thing that’s grown faster is the gov debt.

There’s been a hyper financialization in the US since the 80s that came along with globalization and free trade that’s coming to an end. The US has a debt problem and needs to inflate it away and in these high inflation negative real yield, and stagnating economic situation, gold and other commodities will outperform stocks and bonds. The 60/40 had its time and real assets are back for a repricing. If you buy a ""shiny rock"" does the seller buy that rock back from you at a higher price even if the demand to sell increases? Is there a ""shiny rock"" equivalent of a share repurchase agreement (share buyback?)

Share buybacks have kept the rate of return of the SPX higher than inflation since 2015 or so and companies are still buying back shares. MongoDB just added a buyback today.

If there is a bactrian inflation event people will have to sell their ""shiny rocks"" to pay their mortgage and you fill find (much like in the Great Depression) that the price of ""shiny rocks"" fall faster and more extreme levels than other asset classes.

As I explained here.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/1kdjrdm/comment/mqbk5jb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/1kdjrdm/comment/mqbk5jb/) Interesting... who is this guy? Yupp Share buybacks work in cheap debt low inflation environments. When real costs are rising pricing power and free cash flow are what matters. With rising debt servicing costs and inflation running hot companies can’t just spend their free cash flow on share buybacks.

Also stocks are far more leveraged and susceptible to forced selling events than gold. Yes in a panic sell off correlations often go to 1 and everything goes down together, but history shows in this type of market regime gold outperforms stocks. Name ends in 4 digits.

1l3c52q,2025-06-04,"Apple ($AAPL) stock forms 'death cross'
[Apple is currently the worst-performing stock](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-stock-hit-with-downgrade-by-needham-analysts-citing-stiff-ai-competition-165555298.html) of its [""Magnificent Seven"" Big Tech peers](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-magnificent-7-are-outperforming-other-stocks-again--heres-why-080034631.html), down roughly 18% for the year. The company has faced lagging sales in China and a sluggish smartphone market. The stock was hit with [two downgrades](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-stock-hit-with-2-downgrades-on-weak-iphone-sales-ai-outlook-180001870.html) in January from Jefferies and Loop Capital.

The company's stock ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)) was downgraded to Hold from Buy by Needham analysts who said the stock is overvalued amid growing AI competition.

Shares, which stood just above $200 on Wednesday, are priced at roughly 26 times the company's projected 2026 earnings, a multiple 50% above its 10-year average and 25% above the current average forward-year 2026 price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 ([\^GSPC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC)).

In April, Apple stock's 200-day moving average rose above its 50-day moving average, a phenomenon called a ""[death cross](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-stock-hit-with-downgrade-by-needham-analysts-citing-stiff-ai-competition-165555298.html).""
Calling that a “death cross” sounds way over the top. Looking at the graph I see the 50-day MA only just rose above the 200-day MA in 2024, so while it’s certainly not good for the past fifty days to be below your highs before then, that doesn’t seem like any kind apocalyptic indication to me. Insane that it’s performing worse than TSLA. 

In all honesty I think it’s an early mover and all the mag 7 will follow this pattern after midterms or sooner. Welcome to ‘technical’ analysis Spooky This is just nonsense. Apple is a leader in sales and merchandise. It might not be the greatest and it is over priced. But, even on a cold slow Wednesday people are in the store buying. Oh no is Apple doomed again?

1l3302h,2025-06-04,"US major automakers manufacturers, fearful they will have to shut down assembly lines, consider moving some parts production to China
Four major automakers are racing to find workarounds to China’s stranglehold on rare-earth magnets, which they fear could force them to shut down some car production within weeks.  


**Several traditional and electric-vehicle makers—and their suppliers—are considering shifting some auto-parts manufacturing to China** to avoid looming factory shutdowns, people familiar with the situation said.  


**Ideas under review include producing electric motors in Chinese factories or shipping made-in-America motors to China to have magnets installed.** Moving production to China as a way to get around the export controls on rare-earth magnets could work because the restrictions only cover magnets, not finished parts, the people said.  


If automakers end up shifting some production to China, it would amount to a remarkable outcome from a trade war initiated by President Trump with the intention of bringing manufacturing back to the U.S.   


“If you want to export a magnet \[from China\] they won’t let you do that. If you can demonstrate that the magnet is in a motor in China, you can do that,” said a supply-chain manager at one of the carmakers.  


China in April began requiring companies to apply for permission to export magnets made with rare-earth metals, including [dysprosium and terbium](https://archive.ph/o/7xsIa/https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/dyspro-what-why-an-obscure-element-has-the-ev-industry-in-a-panic-70623bf4). The country controls roughly 90% of the world’s supply of these elements, which help magnets to operate at high temperatures. Much of the world’s modern technology, from [smartphones to F-35 jet fighters](https://archive.ph/o/7xsIa/https://www.wsj.com/business/china-rare-earth-magnets-us-production-782677e5), rely on these magnets.  


In the U.S., Ford Motor shut down production of the Ford Explorer at its Chicago plant for a week in May because of a rare-earth shortage, a spokesman said.  


Carmakers are also considering stripping out some premium features, such as adjustable seats, that make use of several tiny electric motors. High-end speaker systems that use rare-earth magnets could also be replaced with downgraded versions.  

Make America Horse and Buggy Again! MAHBA! Wouldn’t that be ironic, Trumps attempt to re-shore manufacturing ends up reducing US manufacturing instead. I'm in the automotive supply chain and this electric motor issue has the potential to really halt several brands outright. We could return to the days of the chip shortage where partially completed vehicles roll off the assembly line, to be staged in storage lots. 

Another fun fact, almost all the abs and thermoplastic trim panels are sourced from China. US corporations sold off or sold into private equity factories that had the potential to compete. The usual result of El Tacos plans. Trump is the dumbest, most myopic nation leader in the world. Second place can't even be seen from the White House balcony. Well. Over on the Conservative sub they are calling for the mass jailing of anyone who's against the Trump regime. Anyone who criticises Trump is an enemy and needs to be deported. They want the number of ICE agents doubled. So basically, invest in private prisons I guess. That's going to fix the economy or something. Oh no! Look who really has the cards! Ahhh, this is hilarious.

So instead of the US manufacturing highly technical things like electric motors and fighter jets, we're going to make stupid junk like toilet bowl brushes and have china do the technical manufacturing instead.

It almost makes sense since we've decimated our school system for the last 30 years and stopped pumping out people capable of doing those jobs. The few that can we push into other fields by offering low pay and benefits for manufacturing jobs.

Mission successful I guess? Yeah but they are going to build factories in the US. They should we ready in 2050. ""MAHBA"" sounds like the laugh I did when I saw that Trump's actions are now being proven to not bring manufacturing jobs back.

1l1vc78,2025-06-02,"Alphabet stock could fall as much as 25% in 'black swan event' if judge orders Google Chrome divestiture

It could also gain as much as 25% if someone decides to late night tweet So calls it is Possibly the company could split. If the split entities are revenue generating, the combined value of split entities could be worth more than the parent. This has happened before.

Just bought GOOGL. Who knows. Antitrust has effectively become a subsidiary of Big Tech — and that’s one of the most alarming failures possible in a free-market economy. Let’s see what happens to Alphabet It’s not a black swan event if you see it coming. Solid reporting ""I use Google AI to make all my decisions.""

-Tronald Dump Yep I'd argue its already priced fairly given the risk of Chrome divestiture. Already heavily discounted at 18x earnings despite excellent earnings growth, growth in core businesses, and margin improvements. Not to mention AI potential that could drive growth in Android, Google Cloud, YouTube, Workspace, etc. They have a clear advantage over competitors in AI due to vertical integration. They co-design their models with their custom hardware (TPUs) to provide unmatched efficiency per token.

There's a lot of upside potential the next few years between earnings growth and multiple expansion. GOOGL as a sum of parts is worth nearly 4T which is more than 100% its current valuation.

Google Cloud worth 750B (\~50B annual revenue growing 30% YoY).

YouTube worth 500B (\~50B in annual revenue matching Netflix which is valued at 500B).

Android worth 500B (\~50B in annual revenue from app store).

Google ad network worth 300B. (\~30B in annual revenue)

Deepmind and Gemini models worth 300B. (OpenAI just raised at 300B).

AI hardware (TPUs) worth 200B.

Waymo worth 100B.

100B in cash.

200B in other assets (net of debt). (This includes 10% of SpaceX and other capital assets)

That's already 3T and I haven't even accounted for Search, Chrome, Gmail, Maps, Workspace, Pixel and wearable devices, Isomorphic Labs, Verily, etc. There's another 1T in value there even after discounting for risk to Search revenue from AI disruption.

Current market cap 2T compared to an estimated 4T in assets.

At 4T they would trade at 36x trailing earnings (comparing favorably to Microsoft that trades at 36x right now). “I just had a beautiful dinner with Sundae at Google. We agree!

1l0qefc,2025-06-01,"Bullish on SPY
What I have understand is that market negatively reacts to Tariff implementation. This is the market sentiment.  
  
Since Tariffs have been paused, cut off, or delayed to another time. Some courts are suspending the Trump Tariff.  
  
Market has been behaving positively, It has also broken the previous small resistance at the price $575. And has also retracement. If you put moving average of 10, you can see it has retested below level but closes above the MA which is a good signal.  
  
I believe SPY will touch $607 within 2 weeks from now, and hopefully a fundamental news will break the $610 level.  
  
And it is common sense if SPY moves rapidly upwards, almost all of the SP500 companies will go up ( not all).  
  
Bullish volume has also massively increased.

lol, what you overlook is that we’re no longer trying to predict the trajectory of the market, instead it all comes down to what Trump is going to say next. He literally just started fresh attacks on China and the EU. Fundamentals don’t matter This dude is bullish and Trump is fighting the courts for tariffs, while Trump randomly adds more tariffs at random to random sectors of the market all the while he completely lied about any deals he actually made….

Oh boy were at the top In the long run, yes. In the short term, no. 

The reason I say that is because the constant flip flopping from Trump is having a negative effect in the real world, it isn’t just some market swing. Businesses are raising prices to counteract the tariffs, people are buying less. Less demand for product = less demand for manufacturing said product = less people needed to make said product = layoffs. Vicious circle.  

Not to mention our exports are down.

When it comes to the market, tariffs aren’t the issue, the issue is Trump changing his mind every 2 weeks. 😱 I mean can spy make an ATH this month? Sure.  Is this the time to 'buy the dip'?  I feel that time was closer to when SPY was around 500.  But markets do what markets want to do.  So we'll see how things play out. Remindme! in 2 weeks Expect more downward pressure into Monday, though market is supportive through June opex for positive movement. News and events could change this though. Either way it’s still a risk off atmosphere of fundamentals. The market price is the market sentiment. You dont have any secret information.

So this is pure guessing.

Also you seem to believe in ""TA signals"" which also isnt real. Did you miss the announcement for new tariffs on steel and aluminum starting on Wednesday?


Those tariffs he does have control over. The issue is tariffs are just the opening volley. No one understands how these prices will affect businesses yet. Could be that we’ve priced-corrected enough but I think it’s more likely that we’ll begin seeing minor layoffs or reduced/negative profit margins next quarter.

1l05nrd,2025-05-31,"Week & Month Recap: The week and month closed positively. Core PCE inflation decreased. This May was the best-performing May since 1990.
First of all, I don't want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it reflects closing prices from May. 23 to May. 30. 

Today is the last day of the May and we've completed the week as well. So, we can discuss both of them in a single post. As mentioned in the title, May performed very good compare to long-term in May's. It was the most positive May since November 2023 with a gain of 8.92%. It also the best-performing May since 1990 with a gain of 9.19%.

Of course, these gains are closely linked to the performance in February and April, but the S&P 500 showed a strong recovery after that. The stock market continues to focus on tariff concerns which caused some volatility depending on related news. Additionally, inflation data has supported this rally so far, but the Fed has not given any positive signals yet. They continue to mark tariffs and their potential impact.

Let's take a look at the weekly and monthly closing values, and then we'll continue with this week's events.

🔸 Tuesday: Monday was a holiday, so the stock market opened on Tuesday. Last Friday, Trump said that a deal with EU could not reached and prosed a 50% tariff starting June 1. Over the weekend, he extended the deadline to July 9. Thus, the stock market started higher more than 1%. This week also was several key economic data releases. Consumer Confidence acme at 98 and its the highest level in the past 3 months. Since June 2024, this data had not dropped below 100, but it began a streak after March. It boosted the market. The S&P 500 closed more than 2% higher  and breaking 4-day losing streak. 🟢

🔸 Wednesday: The FOMC meeting minutes and $NVDA’s earnings results after the session were two key events. The stock market opened flat. In my opinion, FOMC meeting went as expected. They noted that the tariffs were larger and broader than expectations. The market didn't lose much and closed down by around 0.5%. 🔴

🔸 Thursday: After Wednesday's session, Nvidia released stronger than expected Q1 results. Before the market opened, Q1 GDP data came in slightly better than expectations. The forecast was -0.3%, but it came -0.2%. Also, the federal court blocked tariffs. However, weekly continuing jobless claims were released and reached 1,919K the highest level since October 2023. The stock market focused positive news and opened around 1% higher. As we know, tariffs are major concerns on the market. In the session, the stock market gave back some gains, but it still closed around 0.5% up. Lastly, U.S. trade team will visit India June 5-6. 🟢

🔸 Friday: Before the session, Fed's favorite economic indicator that Core PCE inflation was released. It came mounthly at 0.1% and decreased yearly from 2.6% to 2.5%. It's the lowest level since March 2021. However, Scott Bessent said trade talks between the U.S. and China have a bit stalled. As a result, the stock market opened slightly lower. During the session, The White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy said that Trump is preparing actions against China. The stock market reacted negatively at first, but later recovered and S&P 500 closed down just 0.01%. 🔴

After PCE inflation data, the earliest predicted rate cut is September 2025. However, expectations for total number of cuts in this year decreased from 3 or 4 to 2. This is not a good sign for the stock market yet. On the other hand, tariffs remain the main concern and we've been hearing both positive and negative updates. The S&P 500 has reached around 6,000 level and I believe it needs some strong positive news to break. What do you think? And how was your week?

The market was artificially dragged down, and is trying to snap back to where it was before it was messed with. Saying that's a good thing is like watching an olympic swimmer do really well, then someone slap cement shoes on them to make them drown, then take off the shoes and applaud at how amazing they're doing resurfacing so quick. When you look at the big picture, we all could have been so much higher if market manipulation hadn't happened in the first place. This is ignoring that the other guy was right and you can’t read a simple graph or you would be able to see that. This month was only impressive because it rebounded after our moronic leadership attempted to fix their ridiculous mistakes, and the markets reflect that perfectly Best performing since 1990 is a bit misleading since the market dipped in March and April and still hast recovered to the same level. how can I find this app and does it support zoom in? Great recap! May was a standout month for the S&P 500, up 6.15%, the best since 1990, despite tariff concerns driving volatility. The week's 1.87% gain, boosted by positive Consumer Confidence and Core PCE inflation dropping to 2.5%, shows resilience. However, stalled trade talks and Fed caution on rate cuts (now eyed for September) keep markets on edge. I think breaking 6,000 needs a clear tariff resolution or stronger economic signals.

1lnhfn1,2025-06-29,"District Metals (DMX.V / DMXCF): The Most Asymmetric Uranium Play No One’s Talking About
While most uranium investors are focused on Canada, Kazakhstan, or Namibia, a massive uranium deposit in Sweden is quietly positioning itself to shake up the entire sector. It’s called Viken, and it’s owned by a tiny company with a market cap under $100M CAD: District Metals.

This is a sleeper play with ridiculous potential. Here’s why:

⸻

🗺️ What is District Metals?

District Metals is a Canadian junior exploration company with a flagship project in central Sweden, known as the Viken deposit.
	•	Once owned by a Swedish state company
	•	Contains Uranium, Vanadium, Zinc, and Nickel
	•	Dormant for over a decade due to legal bans on uranium mining in Sweden

They just released an updated 2024 resource estimate — and it’s absolutely massive.

⸻

🔥 Updated 2024 Resource Numbers

📌 Indicated:
	•	456 million tonnes @ 175 ppm U₃O₈ → 176 million lbs of uranium

📌 Inferred:
	•	4.33 billion tonnes @ 161 ppm U₃O₈ → 1.53 billion lbs of uranium

Total: ~1.7 BILLION lbs of uranium — and they haven’t drilled a single new hole yet.
This update was made using historical data (2006–2012) and new modeling.

Also included:
	•	27B lbs of Vanadium
	•	4B lbs of Zinc
	•	3.3B lbs of Nickel

We’re talking about one of the largest untapped critical metals resources in the Western world.

⸻

🧨 Legal Uranium Ban in Sweden? Here’s the Catalyst

Sweden banned uranium exploration and mining in 2018.

But here’s the kicker:
	•	The current pro-nuclear government has already committed to reversing the ban
	•	The vote is expected in September or October 2025
	•	The legal change would take effect in January 2026

This would unlock Viken as one of the largest uranium resources in Europe, at a time when nuclear energy is regaining momentum globally.

⸻

💡 Why Isn’t Everyone Talking About This?

Because:
	•	No production yet
	•	Low-grade deposit (but massive scale)
	•	No modern PEA (yet)
	•	Located in a country without a uranium mining track record

But that’s exactly why the stock is still trading under the radar.
This is how asymmetric bets are born.

⸻

👥 The Team

District is led by Garrett Ainsworth, one of the key geologists behind NexGen’s Arrow discovery. This isn’t his first rodeo.

Also: the Lundin family (yes, that Lundin family) is quietly part of the shareholder base. Enough said.

⸻

💣 The Real Potential

If the uranium law passes in Sweden and District publishes a solid PEA…
	•	Viken could attract majors or strategic partnerships
	•	EU critical metals funding or offtake agreements could follow
	•	A full re-rate toward $500M–$1B CAD is not a moonshot — it’s plausible

Compare that to today’s ~$90M market cap.

⸻

⚠️ Risks You Should Know

Let’s be real. This isn’t Cameco.
	•	No cash flow → future dilution is coming
	•	No PEA → we don’t know capex/opex yet
	•	Community and permitting risk → it’s Sweden, not Namibia
	•	Grades are low, but scale is enormous

That said, at this valuation? You’re being paid to take on early-stage risk.

⸻

📈 Final Thoughts

This is the kind of setup I love:
✅ Massive overlooked asset
✅ Upcoming legal catalyst
✅ Proven leadership
✅ Insider/family office involvement
✅ Unloved jurisdiction on the cusp of change

If the law passes and a decent PEA lands… District Metals could go from a forgotten microcap to a core uranium player in Europe.
Before I get any shit about it the all research is mine, I have been invested for months already and I wanted to share this opportunity with you all, but because my first language is not English I use chat gpt to write the thread for me, and I’ll say it again using all the information that I gathered 😊

1lm0wbi,2025-06-27,"PSTV - is $3.80 programmed?

Doing some research and stumbled on some Alpha— Plus Therapeutics ($PSTV) may be quietly setting up one of the most mathematically predictable climbs we’ve seen in a while. And no, this isn’t some hyped-up meme pump — it’s baked into their financing structure.

Here’s what’s going on:

⸻

THE SETUP
	•	PSTV is raising $25 million via equity financing
	•	They’re limited to selling 300,000 shares per day
	•	To hit the full $25M in 60 days, the share price must gradually rise
	•	Starts at $0.30 and must climb to about $3.80 by Day 60

If the price stays flat at $0.30, they’d only raise around $5.4M. That’s not enough.
If the price increases about 4.4% per day, they hit the full $25M right on time. This isn’t speculation — it’s just math.

This is one of the rare times where price growth is structurally necessary for the plan to succeed.

⸻

DARK POOL ACTIVITY JUST DROPPED — BIG SIGNAL

Huge development:
	•	Short volume in dark pools dropped from 164 million shares to 29 million
	•	That’s a massive unwind, and it’s likely a signal that institutional shorts are backing off or covering

Institutions may have shorted PSTV heavily during its weaker phases, selling shares they didn’t own to suppress the price.
But now? The price has to rise for the funding deal to succeed — and suddenly, short volume collapses.  Also, HC Wainwright magically adjusted their outlook to $3. That timing isn’t coincidence.

⸻

WHERE THE BREAKOUT COULD START

Here’s the likely pressure point setup:
	1.	Price hits $0.50 to $1.00 → shorts start to panic
	2.	Short volume stays low → selling pressure eases
	3.	Price needs to reach $3.80 by Day 60 → the funding partner may begin actively supporting the price

The closer it gets to that $3.80 mark, the more explosive it could get.

⸻

""A"" PLAN

Right now, this stock is at .32. If this hits just $1, you’re already up huge.

But I’ve mapped out a strategy to secure profits while still keeping upside alive:
	•	Sell 500 shares at $1.50
	•	Sell 500 at $2.50
	•	Sell 400 at $3.80
	•	Keep 700 for moon dreams in case this rips to $5 or higher

Goal: lock in ~ $2,500 profit and let the rest run.

⸻

THIS ISN’T RANDOM

Notice the back-to-back “positive” press releases? That’s not coincidence. It’s part of a controlled campaign to support the price — not flood the market.

They’re not dumping shares into the market — they’re managing the slope upward to hit a funding goal.

⸻

WHAT IS PSTV?

Plus Therapeutics (NASDAQ: PSTV) is a clinical-stage biotech company developing targeted radiotherapeutics for rare and difficult-to-treat cancers, including glioblastoma, leptomeningeal metastases, and other CNS tumors. Their platform uses radioisotope-based drugs delivered directly into cancerous tissue through localized infusion, maximizing tumor impact while minimizing harm to healthy cells. They’ve received FDA Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations and are backed by NIH funding and military grant support, giving them both regulatory momentum and long-term potential.

FINAL THOUGHTS

	•	PSTV is in a rare position where price growth isn’t just hopeful — it’s required
	•	Short sellers appear to be backing off
	•	Positive news isn’t random — it’s part of a carefully timed strategy
	•	$3.80 isn’t a dream target — it’s a math-backed funding goal
	•	If it gains momentum, it could ignite something far bigger

If it runs, you heard it here first, save receipts now!
No such thing as a free lunch ""Down 16% today? That's just PSTV's morning warm-up routine 

With 35% average daily swings, this thing moves more than my wife's boyfriend when he hears me coming home. Still needs to 40x to hit those analyst targets, so today's dip is just a rounding error on the way to tendie town (or zero, I eat crayons remember)."" This news certainly helped the equity price--https://finance.yahoo.com/news/plus-therapeutics-announces-comprehensive-restructuring-113000722.html And the shorts were caught....short. But they still need to raise capital. There is NO way you can project a guarantee on stock movement. Sorry. Not possible. Be careful with this one. Just an opinion. It is already 16% down today, which I don't think, according to you is needed to reach the goal Question.....

 Now let's get this straight. I'm dumb as hell in this stock trading world. I huff the brake cleaner and paint in the shop class, sniff the sharpies and then i eat the crayons.

But..... if it MUST go to 3.80..... why are you selling along the way? Wouldn't you let your .30ish shares ride? Because things breakdown, black swans fly, and shit happens - this is a use case where the company has coordinated a pump but you have to hedge against Murphy’s Law always. Sounds like you are banking on ""the company really needs the share price to increase so it will increase."" But while issuing new shares will raise capital for the company, it will also dilute and probably result in the share price dropping or staying flat. I'll keep an eye on it but this sounds like wishful thinking. Pretty much every company wants their share price to go up but just having a buyer doesn't seem like enough to me. Good luck though! Is $20-$127 even possible seeing now today analyst predictions Appreciate the caution, and you’re absolutely right that no outcome is guaranteed — market behavior always involves uncertainty.

That said, the unique aspect of PSTV’s current financing structure is that it creates a mathematically modeled incentive alignment between the issuer (PSTV) and the capital provider (Lincoln Park Capital). The agreement caps daily equity sales at 300,000 shares, meaning that in order to raise the full $25 million authorized over a 60-day horizon, the average share price must increase incrementally — from roughly $0.30 to a terminal value near $3.80.

This isn’t a speculative projection about market behavior — it’s a structural reality embedded in the financing math. If the share price remains static, the company raises significantly less than intended. Therefore, both the company and the funding counterparty have vested interest in maintaining orderly upward price momentum — either through press releases, investor engagement, or withholding supply from the market.

Of course, market volatility and external factors could derail that trajectory — which is why this is not a prediction, but rather an analysis of aligned incentives and capital structure mechanics.

1llx4ou,2025-06-27,"$EXFY: A $3 Penny Stock with F1 Movie Hype and Big Upside Potential
Hey r/pennystocks! Let’s talk **Expensify ($EXFY)**, a $2.55 tech stock that’s flying under the radar but could pop off thanks to a massive marketing push in the new *F1* movie, out today. If you’re hunting for a cheap play with a catalyst, this might be your ticket.

https://preview.redd.it/vela3otiph9f1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbafc480714b13782bd55f182894aa29575bd99c

Why $EXFY?

* **Hollywood Spotlight**: Expensify is the lead sponsor for the fictional race team in *F1*, starring **Brad Pitt**. The movie’s a global blockbuster, and their logo is plastered everywhere—think millions of viewers Googling “What’s Expensify?” They’ve already seen sign-ups *quadruple* after events like the Met Gala, per their CEO.!\[Brad Pitt in *F1* racing suit with Expensify logo\]
* **Dirt-Cheap Valuation**: At $2.50, $EXFY’s market cap is \~$306M with $142M in revenue. That’s a **price-to-sales ratio of \~1.5**, crazy low for a SaaS company (most trade at 5-10x). This thing’s priced like it’s going bankrupt, but it’s not.!\[Chart showing EXFY’s drop from $27 IPO to $3.30\]
* **Growth Signals**: Expensify’s expense management software has 657K paid users and a new travel platform growing 166% quarter-over-quarter. Their card interchange revenue jumped 43% last year. Small businesses love their app—it’s like QuickBooks for receipts.
* **Squeeze Potential**: No hard data on short interest (penny stocks are opaque), but low-float names like this are prime for volatility. If *F1* drives hype, shorts could get burned.

# The Play

This is a high-risk, high-reward bet. The *F1* buzz could drive user growth and put $EXFY on Wall Street’s radar, pushing the stock toward $5-$7 (still below its $27 IPO). With a 1.5 P/S ratio, there’s not much downside—worst case, it drifts sideways. It’s like buying a call option with serious upside if the movie lands.

# Risks

* *F1* flops, and the hype fizzles.
* Penny stocks get crushed in a bad market.
* They burn cash on marketing (though they cut $35M in costs last year).

1llwrn6,2025-06-27,"These 3 Nuclear Stocks Should Be on Your Energy Radar $DNN $NXE $PDN
* Trump boosts nuclear sector with sweeping reforms, including faster reactor approvals, expanded uranium mining, and new federal reactor sites.
* Big Tech strikes landmark nuclear deals as Meta and Microsoft secure 20-year power purchase agreements with Constellation Energy to power AI data centers off-grid.
* Investors eye uranium surge with top stock picks like Denison Mines, NexGen Energy, and Paladin Energy offering high upside amid renewed interest in nuclear power.

https://preview.redd.it/nidd4ku7nh9f1.jpg?width=718&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8ef8882806084580f92d5b54ae29e2553140d792

Nuclear energy stocks have been on a tear again after U.S. President Donald Trump signed executive orders that will facilitate the expansion of nuclear energy production, including expediting the regulatory approvals for new nuclear reactors. The Trump administration intends to reform the nuclear energy sector by overhauling the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), allowing the DoE to build nuclear reactors on federally-owned land, enhancing research at the U.S. Department of Energy and expanding domestic uranium mining and enrichment.

And, Big Tech companies are seizing this opportunity to secure cheap, abundant power supplies for their power-hungry AI data centers. Shares of America’s leading nuclear power plant operator, **Constellation Energy Corp.** (NYSE:CEG), have surged more than 15% after the company unveiled on Tuesday an agreement to sell more than 1,100 MW of nuclear power to **Meta Platforms** (NASDAQ:META) from its Illinois nuclear plant for 20 years. 

According to *The Wall Street Journal*, the deal is the first deal of its kind[ ](https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/meta-signs-nuclear-power-deal-to-fuel-its-ai-ambitions-70c85367)for an operating nuclear plant in the United States, and closely mirrors a similar deal Constellation signed with **Microsoft Corp.** (NASDAQ:MSFT) last year. The Microsoft deal is a 20-year power purchase agreement  (PPA) that will see Constellation Energy restart its undamaged reactor in Three Mile Island, which was undergoing decommissioning. 

Neither deal will draw power from the main grid. However, Meta appears to have secured a better deal, with Citi’s Ryan Levine estimating that the 20-year PPA is priced in the $70-$95/MWh range, considerably cheaper than  Jefferies' estimate of at least $110/MWh for Microsoft's PPA, because Meta’s deal “…*does not offer a substantial premium for low-carbon nuclear power”*. Levine has projected that \~70% of Constellation's existing nuclear plants could secure comparable datacenter deals at \~$80/MWh.

Constellation is unlikely to be the only nuclear power producer that will see surging power demand under a Trump administration that refuses to put a premium on low-carbon energy. Nuclear stocks have mostly taken a breather after a scorching rally triggered by Russia’s war in Ukraine. However, here are 3 nuclear stocks with significant upside.

**Denison Mines Corp.**

**Consensus Price Target: $4.04**

**Implied 12- Month Upside Potential: 148%**

**Denison Mines Corp.**(NYSE:DNN) engages in the exploration, acquisition and development of uranium properties in Canada. Denison has become a Wall Street favorite, with BMO analyst Alexander Pearce saying the stock’s price-to-net present value ratio of 0.9x is one of the most attractive in its group, with clear near-term catalysts. Denison boasts one of the sector’s strongest balance sheets, critical for funding modest capital requirements for its 2.2M lbs Phoenix In-Situ Uranium Recovery project.

Last month, Denison reported Q1 2024 revenue of C$1.38M, good for +66.3% Y/Y growth while quarterly loss of $0.03 per share missed the Wall Street consensus by $0.01. The company achieved \~75% completion of total engineering for Phoenix, and has committed $67 million for long-lead capital purchases. 

**NexGen Energy**

**Consensus Price Target: $12.85**

**Implied 12- Month Upside Potential: 102%**

**NexGen Energy Ltd.** (NYSE:NXE), is a Canadian exploration and development stage company that develops uranium properties in Canada. The company  holds a 100% interest in the Rook I project in southwestern Athabasca Basin of Saskatchewan, totaling an area of \~35,065 hectares. Back in March, NXE shares surged after the company revealed that recent drilling at its Rook I site intersected a rich uranium concentration at its Patterson Corridor East property, the largest development-stage uranium deposit in Canada. According to the company, drillhole RK-25-232 unveiled rich uranium concentration, making it one of the shallowest high-grade intersections at Patterson Corridor.

**Paladin Energy**

**Consensus Price Target: $5.08**

**Implied 12-Month Upside Potential: 21.5%**

**Paladin Energy Ltd** (ASX:PDN TSX: PDN OTCQX:PALAF) is an independent uranium developer with a 75% stake in Namibia’s Langer Heinrich Mine. Last year, Paladin acquired Canada’s **Fission Uranium Corp**., with the company now operating an extensive portfolio of uranium assets across Canada. Paladin is positioning itself as a significant player in baseload energy provision in multiple countries across the globe and contributing to global decarbonization.

Last month, Paladin reported Q3 revenue of $60.97M and GAAP EPS of $0.06. Uranium sales for the quarter were 872,000 pounds, at an average price of $69.90 per pound. The Langer Heinrich property produced 745,000 pounds of uranium, good for a 17% increase on the previous quarter's production to bring total production to over 2 million pounds in the financial year-to-date.

1llvzl0,2025-06-27,"LPSN - Liveperson is being squeezed over $1 again to maintain listing requirements.
It needs to stay over $1 for a certain period of time and the investors are pushing for this. At $1.50 or above for 1 week there will be significant buying pressure on the .5p options closing out. 

They still make money, just not as much as they had once promised which is why they fell. As of right now this isn't a $20+ stock, but its definitely not a penny stock for long. Anything AI is being pushed heavily now. Even if they are very good at taking existing ai features/ functions and applying it to businesses.

1ll947m,2025-06-26,"MVIS at $1 – Undervalued LiDAR Play with Real Tech and Explosive Upside?
Been digging into MicroVision (MVIS) lately and honestly surprised it’s still trading just over $1. This might be one of the more overlooked LiDAR plays in the market and with its current setup, even a single positive announcement could cause a major re-rating.

Here’s why I think it deserves attention:

**1. Real, validated LiDAR tech**  
MVIS has a highway-optimized MEMS-based LiDAR system with specs that rival or exceed the competition. It offers a 250+ meter range, 10.8 million points per second, and a wide field of view, all while resisting sunlight and bad weather. This puts it in a strong position to serve long-range autonomous driving and ADAS needs, where accuracy matters most.

**2. Financially solid with room to execute**  
The company has around $70 million in cash and no long-term debt. That’s 6 to 7 quarters of operational runway, rare for a small-cap tech stock at this stage. It gives them real time to continue R&D, refine their product, and pursue commercial partnerships without immediate dilution.

**3. Acquisition of Ibeo assets**  
Their acquisition of Ibeo’s automotive LiDAR assets strengthened both their IP and their engineering team. It also brought in software capabilities and production-ready systems that could help them scale quickly if a partnership materializes.

**4. Massive upside potential on a single partnership**  
This is the key point. MVIS is pre-revenue, yes, but that also means they’re one OEM or Tier 1 partnership away from a major breakout. If they land a development or licensing agreement, especially with a big name in the EV or robotaxi space, this stock could reprice very quickly. The last time MVIS was tied to Microsoft HoloLens rumors, it ran well past $20. Even a partial move toward that range from today’s $1 levels would be a multi-bagger.

**5. High short interest and technical setup**  
Short interest sits around 20–25% of float, with high borrow costs and a 6–8 day cover ratio. That creates a perfect storm setup if news hits,  it doesn’t even have to be huge. A signed letter of intent, a test fleet integration, or a licensing announcement could be enough to spark a sharp squeeze. Technically, the $1.06–$1.08 range has held repeatedly, and it’s currently sitting just above that base.

**6. Leadership with long-term focus**  
CEO Sumit Sharma has been with the company since 2015 and led the strategic pivot into automotive LiDAR. He’s not just a figurehead, he has engineering and product leadership experience at Google X, Jawbone, and other tech firms. He’s stayed consistent in refining the tech and positioning MVIS for automotive integration.

**7. Demand for LiDAR isn't going away**  
Even though Tesla pushes a camera-only approach, most other OEMs are leaning toward sensor redundancy, including LiDAR, for both safety and regulatory reasons. If Tesla’s robotaxi rollout shows flaws (as early reports suggest), that could strengthen the case for high-resolution LiDAR like MVIS offers.

Bottom line: MVIS is a legitimate tech company with a real product, strong balance sheet, and a clear catalyst path. It’s still speculative, but in my view, undervalued given its positioning. At this price, it feels like a low-cost call option on a major future partnership or product win.

Also found recent posts like this one:

[https://retailtimes.co.uk/why-mvis-stock-is-gaining-attention/](https://retailtimes.co.uk/why-mvis-stock-is-gaining-attention/)

Anyone else in this? Would love to hear thoughts,
Nice to see MVIS shared here again. For those interested, we probably have the most active penny stock subreddit at r/MVIS if you want to dive deeper into the recent action.

Besides OP's points the sustained elevated volume over the past two weeks is notable. Last week Monday traded over 20M shares, and Friday hit 21M with an 11M closing cross. Most of the other days since have been around 10M shares traded — way above the 90-day average of 5M. That kind of volume suggests someone is accumulating, maybe in anticipation of upcoming news.

Longs are still waiting on an industrial deal that was mentioned by Sumit at the retail investor day, expected by September. There are also old executive incentive share price tiers — $12, $18, $24, $36 — if the stock holds those levels for 20 trading days in 2025. Feels out of reach right now, but I'd think possible if MVIS technology is validated with industrial + defense or an auto oem win.

Also worth pointing out: look at AEVA and OUST lately. They’ve been ripping, and while MVIS has a bigger float, it’s also more heavily shorted. So if a legit deal comes through, the upside could be massive — possible short and gamma squeeze potential. I’m in, should say been in.  The tech is 100% going to take off with autonomous vehicles but no idea when, thought they would have exploded around Covid times their tech never did.   

I have around 1000 shares, it is by far my smallest holding but just one of those companies I like and root for Done well swing trading this. In this range it's easy to tell when to buy, when to sell. I’ve held this stock for years it’s been continuously down falling but hopefully things turn around with recent volume Nah he became CEO in 2020 after share price was beat down to $0.15 a share.  It had the meteoric and meme-fueled rise from there up to $28 in 2021.  Been beaten down into penny stock land since waiting for an OEM win with recent pivots to try to market IP in defense and industrial applications. Well it has been holding up surprisingly well over the last 3 months, going up 20% constantly from the support and showing signs of accumulation. It’s been consolidating in a tight range around 1.10, and I’m watching for a breakout above 1.25+. The spike attempts and higher lows lately make me think it's coiling. It is also forming a narrowing wedge. Feels like it’s coiling for a breakout, possibly above 1.25+. I just bought in too, waiting for volume to confirm the move EVEN without news.

1ll0ry5,2025-06-26,"Alt stock info
Altimmune (ALT) may be approaching a key zone after the sharp drop on June 26

Altimmune (NASDAQ: ALT) shares dropped over 60% on June 26 following the release of Phase 2b trial results for pemvidutide, its candidate for the treatment of MASH (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis with fibrosis). While the primary endpoint was achieved—resolution of MASH without worsening of fibrosis—the data on fibrosis improvement did not reach statistical significance compared to placebo, which triggered a strong negative market reaction.

However, after hitting an intraday low around $2.67, the stock showed a solid rebound above $3.20, with significantly elevated trading volume. Secondary analyses, including AI-based assessments, suggest there may be a clinically relevant antifibrotic effect, though this would need to be confirmed in Phase 3.

In the short term, Zacks Investment Research maintains a “Buy” rating on ALT (Rank #2), while the average analyst price target remains in the $20–$21 range, implying a high upside potential—contingent on upcoming clinical and regulatory milestones.

Investors should closely monitor technical behavior and volume over the coming days, especially in light of any news related to partnerships, buyouts, or the anticipated End-of-Phase-2 (EOP2) meeting with the FDA.

Does anyone else believe the reaction was overblown and that this could represent a technical or fundamental rebound opportunity?

I bought it this morning.

^(if) ^(you) ^(have) ^(any) ^(questions) ^(or) ^(concerns.) According to some sources, the drug does what it promised and the results are promising. Somehow the investors decided to go away from the stock because the progress was not significant enough.

I decided to hold the bags for a while; I will gather more info about this case. ""Investors should closely monitor technical behavior and volume over the coming days, especially in light of any news related to partnerships, buyouts, or the anticipated End-of-Phase-2 (EOP2) meeting with the FDA.""

and what if none of those things happen? Bankruptcy? Yeah, I already studied this stock and I believe it could reach at least $4. My target is between $5 and $6, so let’s see what happens. The rebound might come tomorrow or sometime next week. Thanks for sharing this. I’ve seen the announcement. These types of investigations are actually quite common after sharp drops, especially when clinical results are involved. For now, it seems more like law firms trying to gather shareholders for a potential class-action lawsuit. As long as there are no official charges or a negative response from the company, I still view this as a short-term speculative move.

1lkzk6z,2025-06-26,"Apple iPhone Fold Production Start
Kuo had written that the hinge will be made of LiquidMetal (LQMT), and this rumor indicates that production will start in the fall. 

(FYI - Yes, my alias has LQMT in it, but I am not a pumper or trader. I have been holding long and accumulating this one for a long time. For more info, you can visit the LiquidMetal website and the LQMT Reddit site.)

https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/18/foldable-iphone-manufacturing-2025-start/
I am very optimistic on LQMT. Been holding and doubling down for 12 years. 
This company just makes sense to me. They have been moving toward mass production for years and finally accomplished it a few years ago. The adoption is under way. 
I doubt Apple and Medical companies are going to be using aluminum and titanium forever. The new material always comes a long in the mage of advancement. I think Liquidmetal will be it. lol I’ve had LQMT since the rumors of the iPhone 5 Sim tray and ejector were made from them lol ......... people actually like foldable smartphones? Sold Apple last night and bought Rocket Lab. Very happy I did! I didn’t miss the point - just trying to put a positive spin on it. I know some people got in too early before LiquidMetal had adequate production technologies and lost money. There are investors with a chip on their shoulder and will just pound the crap out of the company to make themselves feel better. I’d be underwater myself if I hadn’t loaded up on 4 cent shares. In the last two months the PPS has nearly tripled. I loaded up on them because I believe this is a game changer material that is now ready for prime time thanks to Lugee Li’s work over the past six years. It might be a good idea for investors to keep an eye on a company working with $30 million in assets and developing sales. Anyway, I’ll keep posting the news here so that people can make their own decisions about where the company is today vs.15 years ago. Awesome. Keep holding! Did you see at the last CC the CEO mentioned that they were prototyping a premium credit card for a major company? Did you see that they just created LiquidMetal Asia Holdings and Lugee Li will be paid to run it? They are also working with health companies. It’s finally starting the commercialization phase, and I believe it will be significant. Exciting times ahead! This is actually piquing my interest.  Research commences.  Thank you.

1lkyroi,2025-06-26,"Gold > $2,300, Copper > $4.50: Macro Tailwinds Point Right at USAU
Inflation fears, central-bank buying, and geopolitical jitters keep gold elevated. Add copper’s EV-driven deficit, and CK Gold’s Au-Cu combo becomes a macro hedge with growth torque.



Contrast that with offshore peers battling royalties and social risk. A fully domestic project reduces supply-chain headaches and ESG scorecards love “local metal.” Betting on USAU isn’t just a gold play—it’s a way to ride two critical metals inside U.S. borders.



📢 Not financial advice—just a macro lens on a micro-cap.
Multiple reverse splits done. 

NTCPF is a significantly larger project with far more upside potential.

and it's not even a penny USAU is trading at $12.60 ...

Rather buy USAS 🏆 Americas Gold and Silver Not really. The RSs happened  almost 25 years ago when it was a tech company called Dataram and they were one of many caught in the Dot Com bubble bursting. They merged with a mining explorer and reincorporated in 2016, so basically a completely different company.

Also, stock price may be high, but because it has such a low float, market cap is only about $170M. I'd consider that a penny stock. With enough stock splits, Google could get their share price under $1, but it wouldn't be a penny stock.

That said, USAU is at a point on the Lassonde Curve where they're going to need serious funding to keep moving the project forward. They have strong inside ownership, so I think they'll do whatever they can to avoid dilution, but that risk is always out there. And just as a general rule, I get nervous when I start seeing marketing posts like OP popping up here.",13,0.88,4,0,3421431boom,pennystocks,['META'],gold 2300 copper 450 macro tailwinds point right usau inflation fears centralbank buying geopolitical jitters keep gold elevated add coppers evdriven deficit ck golds aucu combo becomes macro hedge growth torque contrast offshore peers battling royalties social risk fully domestic project reduces supplychain headaches esg scorecards love local metal betting usau isnt gold playits way ride two critical metals inside us borders financial advicejust macro lens microcap multiple reverse splits done ntcpf significantly larger project far upside potential submission fit subreddit please upvote comment fit subreddit please downvote comment bot comment made automatically please contact us via modmail questions concerns gifgiphydum6jzemplojuyqmxd even penny usau trading 1260 rather buy usas americas gold silver really rss happened almost 25 years ago tech company called dataram one many caught dot com bubble bursting merged mining explorer reincorporated 2016 basically completely different company also stock price may high low float market cap 170m id consider penny stock enough stock splits google could get share price 1 wouldnt penny stock said usau point lassonde curve theyre going need serious funding keep moving project forward strong inside ownership think theyll whatever avoid dilution risk always general rule get nervous start seeing marketing posts like op popping
1lkxa54,2025-06-26,"The New Corporate Treasury Boom
Public companies are increasingly replacing their traditional cash reserves with digital assets as a long-term treasury strategy. For some companies, it’s a hedge. For others, it’s a headline. Either way, digital assets are creeping onto corporate balance sheets fast, and I don’t see that slowing down anytime soon.

BTC was the gateway, but now we’re seeing ETH, SOL, and many others make their way into treasury strategies. What started with MicroStrategy has become a full-blown shift in how companies think in 2025. And it’s not just large caps anymore; this trend is trickling down into juniors and microcaps.

Many of the obvious names have already run. Others are getting lost in the flood of announcements. But if you zoom out, it still feels like we’re early. My approach is to find one to hold long-term, and a few others to trade around. Here’s how I’m playing it:

**Metaplanet Inc ($MTPLF)** – *The long-term hold watch*

Metaplanet is a former hotel management company that has pivoted into Japan’s first publicly listed BTC treasury company. They have an aggressive strategy to acquire and hold BTC as their core reserve asset. Metaplanet has quickly accumulated over 11,000 BTC and aims to reach 210,000 BTC by 2027, which would make it one of the world’s largest public BTC holders.

On June 24th, Metaplanet announced that they are expanding into the U.S. by allocating the capital to its American subsidiary to execute the ""555 Million Plan"", which is how they will become one of the world’s largest corporate holders.

The company is issuing 555 million shares to raise $5.4 billion, with over 95% of the funds dedicated to buying BTC. They’re using a mix of convertible bonds, moving strike warrants, and traditional debt to raise the money over the next two years.

The plan marks a significant shift in corporate treasury strategy, with Metaplanet focusing solely on accumulating BTC rather than traditional business investments. They are executing the same plan in Japan that Saylor did in the US.

Their BTC roadmap:

* 30,000 BTC by the end of 2025
* 100,000 BTC by the end of 2026
* 210,000 BTC by 2027

It’s bold and aggressive, but if you believe in BTC long-term, Metaplanet is a high-beta way to get exposure. Personally, I missed the early run on MicroStrategy, so this feels like a second chance to be early on something similar.

**Spetz Inc ($SPTZ.CN)** – *The short-term trade watch*

Spetz brought in a new CEO, announced the divestiture of its legacy Spetz app business, and confirmed a strategic pivot to focus entirely on its blockchain infrastructure subsidiary, SonicStrategy Inc., which is now the primary business of Spetz.

This move allows Spetz to dedicate all resources and attention to expanding within the Sonic blockchain ecosystem, specifically through validator infrastructure, staking, and DeFi strategies.

On June 12th, they announced the launch of their first institutional-grade validator (Validator #45) on the Sonic blockchain, where they’re currently earning:

* 4.62% yield on 500,000 $S tokens staked ($S is the native token of the Sonic network)
* 15% of staking income on \~6.7 million tokens delegated by other users.

On June 20th, they closed the final tranche of their PP for \~$8.5M, giving them a strong cash position. They also recently acquired 1.2M $S tokens for $520K, and 1M $ tokens for $373K, bringing total holdings to 8.2M tokens. This is all part of the strategy to build long-term exposure to Sonic.

Sonic ($S) was listed on Coinbase on June 24th and has rebounded from a $0.34 low to around $0.42. It’s already moving, and $SPTZ has been performing well even while $S was getting smoked YTD.

That’s what caught my eye. The company is earning yield and building token exposure regardless of price. If $S rebounds further, I expect $SPTZ to follow.

And if $S stays weak? They keep stacking at a discount. It's the same logic Metaplanet and MicroStrategy use to accumulate as much as you can while it’s cheap.

This whole trend feels like we’re still in the early innings of something much bigger. Digital assets on the balance sheet are no longer just a speculative bet. I’m watching this space closely because there are going to be more of these.

If you’re watching any others, drop them below. I want to see what names are on everyone’s radar. This is NFA, cheers!

1lkkufb,2025-06-25,"$FOMO – Deep Dive into Formation Metals' Media-Driven Battery Metals Play
**Hello!**  
Been digging into *Formation Metals* ($FOMO — yeah, wild ticker name) and found some cool stuff about what they’re up to. Quick rundown:

# What Do They Actually Do?

They’re in the battery metals + clean energy space, but not just sitting on assets like most small caps. They're building a *narrative-first* brand — and they’re doing it loud.

* **Media Focused**: Pushing content, awareness, and trying to stand out in front of retail. Think more visibility, less drill results.
* **Looking for Deals**: Exploring partnerships + acquisitions across the supply chain — possibly refining/logistics.
* **Retail Branding**: Positioning themselves as *the* early-stage play in battery metals for small investors.

# What’s New?

* They filed a Form 1-A extension (June 2025), likely prepping for a Reg A+ raise.
* Revamped branding + content rollout seems to be picking up steam.
* They're clearly gearing up for attention — maybe a campaign or awareness push?

# Why Watch?

* **Capital raise = more momentum.**
* **Battery metal demand is heating up globally.**
* **Low float + media push = could move quick on news.**

Not financial advice, just watching the story unfold. Anyone else looking into them?

1lk9bb3,2025-06-25,"This AI Stock is at $0.74 – Here’s Why I Think $5 Isn’t Crazy ($LPSN)
LivePerson ($LPSN) has come up a few times here, but the situation seems to be shifting more meaningfully now.

They’re not building flashy LLMs or consumer apps their focus is enterprise AI for contact centers essentially replacing human agents with automation.Not the loudest AI story, but potentially a very profitable niche

A new exec team (ex-VMware) has taken over and started the cleanup:

* Divesting unprofitable segments
* Refocusing on core products
* Pushing toward positive cash flow

**Q1 2025 earnings** came in better than expected:

* Revenue: $64.7M (above midpoint of guidance)
* Adj. EBITDA: +$0.2M (positive, above guidance range)

There’s still a path to go but directionally, this is the most stable they’ve looked in a while.

Delisting panic? Already happened earlier this year. They're now required to trade above $1 for 10 consecutive days before mid-October. They’re hovering around that markso next earnings could tip the scales.

**Cash on hand**: $176M  
**Full-year revenue guide**: $240M–$255M  
**Q2 loss guide**: $2M–$4M (same ballpark as previous quarters)  
In December, they beat and the stock nearly doubled, so it wouldn’t be the first time sentiment flips quickly.

Why bring this up now?  
There are **upcoming contract wins** expected that will serve as a catalyst and management is still targeting **profitability by Q1 2026**. If that holds and the AI tailwind continues, the valuation looks compressed relative to peers.

Yes, they still carry debt and yes, risk is there but the fundamentals are trending in the right direction. Still seems under-followed, and likely undervalued at current levels. Charts look calm, volume is thin, and it feels like it’s waiting on something

Not financial advice, just wanted to share where things stand  
Curious if anyone else here is still tracking $LPSN or already positioned??
If they continue to under promise and over deliver I think the turnaround can succeed. https://preview.redd.it/k59i667jb59f1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5622b23d7f5b42c7bc8ec3b39dc2f92ae6305d24

1lk61a9,2025-06-25,"Diving Deeper into Formation Metals... Don't get FOMO
Good morning everyone! I dove deeper into Formation Metals (($FOMO), yes i know their ticker is crazy, and uncovered some interesting details about their company and current operations. Alright lets dive in!  
  
**What Does Formation Metals Actually Do?**

Formation Metals is focused on **battery metal resource development** and **clean energy infrastructure** . These are two sectors that continue to get global attention, even as markets stay shaky.

But unlike most junior miners or “green” companies that just sit on assets, FOMO is actively creating a narrative-driven platform which is quite different. I break it down below:

* **Media & Retail Investor Targeting**: They’re pushing consistent messaging, running educational content, and building online awareness. Their public-facing strategy isn’t just about discovery drilling — it’s about visibility.
* **Strategic Acquisitions & Partnerships**: FOMO has been exploring upstream and downstream opportunities to strengthen their supply chain positioning. That could mean future deals in refining, logistics, or joint ventures.
* **Narrative Positioning**: They’re not just playing the “battery metals” card. They’re trying to own it. Formation is becoming the brand that retail investors associate with early-stage exposure to the green metals push.

Is this narrative push good or bad? Only time will tell, but it is nice to see them actively trying new. ideas. 

**Recent Activity (June - July 2025)**

* Formation filed a **30-day Form 1-A extension**, indicating they’re moving toward a **Reg A+ offering**. This is a strong signal of intent to raise capital for upcoming initiatives (likely exploration or media expansion).
* New branding, updated digital assets, and content rollouts have picked up pace. They're actively courting attention from both institutional and retail sides.

**2025 Outlook: What Could Happen?**

Let’s lay it out:

**Capital Raise Incoming**: The Form 1-A extension points to a new raise. If successful, this means more cash to move the needle.

**Catalyst-Led Awareness**: With more attention on battery metals thanks to global EV targets and power grid demands, expect stronger organic tailwinds. A single drilling update or environmental approval could spark upside.

 **Retail Momentum Play**: FOMO’s media-heavy approach means it’s well positioned to run when sentiment shifts. The chart doesn’t need much volume to move, which makes this a ticker that could pop fast on the right news.

Communicated Disclaimer - This is not financial advice. Just the tip of the ice berg of DD [1](https://formationmetalsinc.com/), [2](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VF1.F/), [3](https://stockresearchtoday.com/powering-the-clean-energy-transition-with-critical-minerals/)
Interesting breakdown, definitely some potential, but still feels early. Let’s see if they can actually follow through on the plans. Interesting!! Could be super early to the party with this one. Have you invested yet? Not enough movement and it’s hard getting behind companies who are just behind on revenue. I have had some success in the past, but obviously not every company has been a winner.

1lk3qv8,2025-06-25,"Plus Therapeutics: Brain Cancer Tendies or Behind Wendy's? 🚀
# Plus Therapeutics: Brain Cancer Tendies or Behind Wendy's? 🚀

**DISCLAIMER: This is not financial advice. I eat crayons for breakfast and my last ""sure thing"" was buying Blockbuster calls in 2023. If you're taking investment advice from someone who thinks ""diversification"" means buying both red AND green crayons, you belong here.**

Listen up degenerates, gather 'round for the most regarded DD you'll read today about Plus Therapeutics (PSTV) - a penny stock biotech that's either going to print harder than JPow's money printer or send you straight to the dumpster behind Wendy's. Currently trading at a spicy $0.18-$0.32 after getting absolutely demolished 88% this year, this bad boy is showing the kind of volatility that makes GME look like a boomer bond.

# The Science Stuff (For Wrinkle Brains Only) 🧠

Alright smooth brains, try to follow along. PSTV's got this drug called REYOBIQ™ that basically nukes brain cancer from orbit. We're talking **76% of patients** showing improvement in the nastiest brain cancer that usually deletes people in 4-6 weeks. Their other trial? Patients living **17 months instead of 8 months**. That's literally DOUBLE the survival rate - imagine if your portfolio only went down 50% instead of 100%!

The FDA is all over this like apes on green crayons - Fast Track status, Orphan Drug designation, the whole nine yards. They even let them name it REYOBIQ™ which sounds way cooler than whatever garbage names other biotechs come up with. Phase 2 trials are pumping, and they're planning to test this on kids with brain cancer by late 2025 (yeah, I know, right in the feels).

# The Tendie Mathematics 📊

Here's where it gets spicy. Three analysts with actual wrinkles in their brains have Buy ratings with price targets averaging **$10-13**. Current price? Sub-$0.50. Quick maffs: that's potentially 4,000%+ gains. One absolute madlad at Ascendiant Capital threw out a $20.50 target - that's nearly 6,000% upside. Even the biggest 🌈🐻 analyst says $4, which is still a 10-bagger from here.

BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE! Management just pulled a galaxy brain move and canceled warrants that could've diluted shareholders with **1.5 BILLION shares**. That's right, they literally deleted the ""dilution to oblivion"" button. They raised $15 million in March, turning their cash position from ""literally can't afford ramen"" ($0.1M) to ""can survive another 6-9 months"" ($9.9M).

# Why This Could Moon 🌙

* **Breakthrough drug data**: Literally doubling survival rates (imagine if you could double your Wendy's shifts!)
* **Zero competition**: They're the only players in this space (monopoly money printer go brrr)
* **FDA loves them**: More designations than your wife's boyfriend has side pieces
* **Analyst PTs**: Even the bears think this is a 10-bagger
* **Dilution cancelled**: Management actually didn't screw shareholders for once
* **Partnerships locked**: Got the manufacturing sorted with real companies

# Why You Might End Up Behind Wendy's 🗑️

* **Cash runway shorter than my attention span**: 6-9 months left, tops
* **Nasdaq is big mad**: Trading under $1, missed filing deadlines (compliance deadline July 21)
* **Volatility is INSANE**: Daily swings average 35% - this thing moves like a meth'd up kangaroo
* **Penny stock problems**: More manipulation than my ex's Instagram photos
* **Clinical trials can fail**: Phase 3 failure rate is over 50% (worse odds than FDs on SPY)
* **Burning $15-20M annually**: They bleed money faster than WSB loses on 0DTE options

# The YOLO Thesis

Look, I'm not saying you should dump your entire Wendy's paycheck into PSTV. But if you're the type of degenerate who thinks ""risk management"" is making sure you have enough left for gas money, this might be your play. The setup is simple:

**BULLISH**: Drug works → FDA approval → Stock goes from $0.30 to $10+ → Lambo **BEARISH**: Drug fails/No money → Stock goes to $0 → Wendy's application

Upcoming catalysts include Phase 2 results, FDA meetings, and potential partnership announcements. Any of these could send this thing to Valhalla or straight to zero. The short interest dropped 85% recently - even the shorts are scared to bet against brain cancer drugs (imagine having a soul).

**FINAL DISCLAIMER: This is absolutely not financial advice. I failed high school chemistry and think ""due diligence"" is a type of detergent. I'm literally just a smooth brain with a Robinhood account and a dream. The fact that you read this entire thing proves you're just as regarded as me. May the tendies be ever in your favor, and remember - it's only a loss if you sell! 💎🙌**

*Position: None because I already YOLO'd everything on gourd futures*
TLDR

 I'm in. All aboard the tendie train Both You took the time to post this. Great DD, keep up the good work fellow degen 🦍 Nice write up. I appreciate your candor. You sold me. I'm in.

The company recently raised $15 million through a preferred convertible offering at $2 per share in October 2024. SKYX has experienced nearly five consecutive quarters of growth and anticipates that its all-in-one fan/heater product will drive cash flow positivity by year’s end.

# Operational Updates

SKYX is making strides in the smart city sector, particularly with a three-year project in downtown Miami’s Wynwood area. This initiative is expected to feature over 500,000 installations of smart platform technologies. The company has partnered with two of Miami’s largest builders and a major international builder.

Distribution partnerships have been secured with leading retailers such as Home Depot, Wayfair, and Kitcher, along with European and Chinese partners, Quizzell and Rui Appliances. The product lineup includes three generations: Plug, Smart, and the soon-to-be-produced All-in-One platform, compatible with Siri, Alexa, and Google Home.

**Unidentified speaker, Narrator**: Skyx platforms. Skyx, the future is here. Advancing, simplifying, while saving time, cost, and lives. Skyx’s technologies won seven CES awards and has nearly 100 US and global patents and patent applications. Thomas Edison invented the light bulb that for many years was installed by twisting hazardous wires until inventing the Edison base that became the global standard in every home and building for billions of light bulbs.

Billions of fixtures are installed annually while touching hazardous dangerous wires and risking lives. SkyX has a goal to follow Edison’s path to become a US and global standard in homes and buildings for billions of fixtures, including smart home, AI, lighting, and fans to become plug and play, advancing their performance, making homes become safer and smart within seconds, while saving time, cost, and lives. Our Gen one Sky Plug enables a safe installation of light fixtures, ceiling fans, smart home, and electronics within seconds, making it safe, easy, and convenient for the user. First time installation takes a minute to install and it is safe to touch. Sky Plug is recognized as part of the NEC, the National Electrical Code, and mentioned in multiple publications acknowledging the safety and the usability its technology brings to the electrical profession.

Our gen two is a smart Sky Plug, takes only seconds to install, and is integrated with the newest technologies and platforms. The Sky Plug Smart is integrated with many smart features, including phone control, voice control, energy saving eco mode, scheduling, dimming, works with Siri, Alexa, Google, Cortana, and SmartThings. It has an emergency light, night light, color changing light. Our Gen three Sky all in one smart home platform enhances your all around lifestyle, making your home become smart and safe instantly. It includes the most advanced smart and safe features that are necessary for every home.

The Sky platform installed safely and simply within minutes to the top center of your ceiling, blending inconspicuously with your decor. The Sky platform is integrated with a backup power failure LED light. In the center of the Sky platform is embedded the Sky outlet as approved by the National Electric Code. Sky plug lighting, fans, accessories can connect with the click of a button to the Sky platform. A series of Sky platforms installed in a home could repeat WiFi signal and play the same music throughout the house.

In the event of a fire, the integrated smoke and c o two sensor would make an alarming sound. The Skyhome app can easily control light intensity, motion detector, light color control, temperature and humidity monitoring, room to room intercom, control volume and music in each room. SkyX platforms.

**Lenny Sokolow, CEO, SKYX Platforms Corp.**: Okay. So sorry. There have been at least some audio problems that we’re having. So we have know, I’m sure you’ve seen the slides, but the CAGR growth has been extraordinary. We have, as I said before, the growth in the markets in multiple ways for home construction, and new buildings, etcetera, will continue.

**And smart, you know, smart buildings, are, again, 97 patents, 36 issued globally. So to continue on, and I know some of the audio has been missed, we have the slides are a little lagging. I’m sorry. The $20.23, 58,800,000.0 in sales. $20.24, 86,300,000.0.**

And we we’ve had almost five consecutive quarters of growth. We did a six with insiders and and the strategic investors, we did a a 15,000,000 raise starting on October of twenty twenty four for a preferred convertible of $2 per share. We have we have, again, our three generations, the plug, the smart, and the all in one, which is will be in production by the end of this year. We have already in the market through our app and and control our generation two, **and it works with Siri, Alexa, Google Home, etcetera. In the last few years, we we’ve won seven CES awards, and we’ve announced a few weeks ago, the $3,000,000,000 smart urban city in Miami was announced.**

This is Downtown Miami. The Wynwood, which is the the graffiti, you know, cool area that they’ve built. You have South Beach over here in the horizon, and we’re the smart city is just north of that. We we expect to have over 500,000 installations of our our smart platform technologies and products. And we and we know that’s a conservative number.

They’re gonna it’s gonna be mixed use commercial and train station to name the other construction that they’ll have there. This is gonna be a, you know, what you know, a a three year project. We have announced two largest builders in Miami as well as one of the most the biggest international builder. And so this is, we think, also a beginning for the smart cities and that we find them as early adopters. So in terms of distribution, we’ve had the Home Depot, Wayfair, Kitcher.

**These are all announced relationships. Quizzell, Agba, the largest in Europe, and Rui Appliances, which is the largest Chinese manufacturer for The US, the Chinese markets, and the European markets. They do about half of the manufacturing for these markets. They’ve provided, as a partner, also financing financial support similar to the financial, you know, opportunity that we use on our websites where we use the Dell model. We collect day one.**

**We don’t pay the vendors till thirty sixty ninety six thirty to sixty days. So we have we’ve also, again, solving this problem of the wires and the plug and using our technology. And so what we’ve done is from a mandatory this is now the the the the regulations behind all of those accomplished. You have the wall outlet here on the left. Lights used to be put in by three wires, and then the outlet was created in nineteen o four.**

Again, the Edison bulb didn’t didn’t become a standard till the Edison socket was created. Nineteen eighties, you have the ground fault circuit interrupter. I know you all have that in your your home or, yeah, in terms of your kitchen or bathroom because it was mandatory in the eighties. This they they created a standard, and your your your buttons may be different color, but everything is a GFCI ground fault circuit and a rupture. The people that all have these patents, they still get royalties on them.

**But what’s interesting is that the people the inventors of the  wall outlet and the GFCI, they  have patents only on the receptacle, not on what got plugged into it. We’re different. We have patents on both sides, the receptacle and the our plug. Very unusual. And I actually met the founder and the executive chairman over thirteen years ago.**

I was the executive general counsel and EVP of a a hair company made hair dryers. And then in the eighties, just after this g GSCI was mandated, I went through the process of having to license this technology, and all the hair dryer companies like GE and Phillips and Sunbeam, Conair, like my company, we had to go license this technology, and it’s now mandatory. You go and buy a hair dryer today. It’s on the end of the cord. And so this is the standard, and this is what the the the the landscape that we completely have in The United States.

And so what we’ve done is that, you know, we’ve we’ve created a standard, just like the solution the solution. This is the equivalency of concepts. So if you the wall outlet that is involved in our outlet. And so what’s what’s transpired is the in terms of the the saline receptacle and why the TAM is so huge is that there’s, you know, there’s so many installations. You’ve got four hundred  over a 140,000,000 homes in The US and about 30 fixtures or installs in The US, about five times more than the wall outlet.

And you’ve the the market for this is massive, and this is just in The US and just in residential. We’re we’re talking about, annually, about 420,000,000 US fixture installs in The US, and then you get the commercial. It’s it’s that much, if not more. So, you know, again, when we went to the regulators, we we presented the equivalency of concepts just like the wall outlet. We have the junction box, which is standard, and we don’t cannibalize anybody.

We don’t replace this. The three wires come out of here, and our those three wires go into our receptacle. We screw in the bracket, cover plate, finished product, and then the plug. So this is what the regulator saw, and this is what we’ve accomplished, really. When you think about FDA or the equivalent, it’s like we got almost over over 10 FDA phase three approvals.

19 o four is the water receptacle. We talked about the eighties, the ground fault circuit interrupter became mandatory. And what happened is over the last thirteen years, we’re we’re at 10 segments in the electrical code. And two years ago, we got approved by ANSI, which most people don’t know. It’s probably even more groundbreaking.

Those are the standards for the commercial buildings. Excuse me. And they this is you you can’t put in rebar or concrete without getting ants having an answer to your subject to answer specifications. We got ANSI approval, which is very unique and very rare. And the American Institute of Architects was already training on our on our solution or products.

So what happened basic basically, after all these segments that were approved and mandated, after a hundred and twenty years, the definition of a receptacle got changed, which most people don’t know. And this is a little disconnect we have in the marketplace because if people knew what they know about the FDA, about the NEC, we would it there’d be a better understanding. But now the the National Electrical Code has changed the code to add a second defined receptacle. You have this one, old from nineteen o four, and you have hours. And so what’s happened is that as a result, a builder could put in a wall outlet.

They don’t need to plug in lamps. They got their seat certificate of occupancy or a permit. They could put in a ceiling receptacle or sconce or an outdoor light, and they don’t need to put in a fixture or a cheap fixture. They just need to put this in. They could get their certificate of occupancy or permit.

**It’s that’s one that one is a groundbreaking time saving and money saving, but that’s not really the best part. And then they what what besides that, they’ve now given us a a generic name already. This is all, you know, codified. They’ve called the they’ve called us the WSER, just like the GFCI. We’re the weight support ceiling receptacle.**

**We’re a receptacle, but we can hold weight. We can hold 200 pounds. The junction box only holds 50. So we we’re we’re we’re overengineered from a weight perspective. So it’s it’s what’s groundbreaking is that over after a hundred and twenty years, the definition has been changed.**

**We’ve been given a a generic name. It’s already in the NEC code book. And the next step that we’ve done is that we’ve applied for mandatory. And the guys that signed our application, just to remind you, are these two guys, Mark Early, had the code and Eric Jacobson. We’ve also announced a very prominent person who’s very close with the US administration and president that the the and a lawyer and very well prominent internationally has concluded that there’s at least four other US agencies that can also require this to be mandatory because we’ve proven that we save lives, and we we mitigate damage damages and property damage.**

**This is the data from the National Fire Protection Association, which is the parent umbrella to the national electrical code.** There’s over four hundred and thirty civilian deaths per year and thousands of injuries annually. This was just from twisting wires of fixtures in the ceiling. Response was wrong. They may work for a couple years, but they’ll maybe they’ll they’ll start to spark an arc if it wasn’t done correctly.

And then over five hundred thousand ladder falls and hundreds of deaths annually. Yesterday, I spoke to someone, an analyst who said their uncle died changing a light bulb in their garage from being on the ladder. And, of course, the tens of thousands of electric shocks, you know, annually. So this is their data. This is they don’t they didn’t give us these code provisions because they like us.

It’s because we save lives according to their own data. So our whole strategy is is basically to you know, when the builder builds the building, they’re putting in, you know, the receptacle, they’re putting nonreceptacle. And they could get their certificate, and then, you know, it’s a we call it the razor and blade model, not to be as simplistic. But and then all these products can click right in and be chain interchange. The reason why the lighting companies have collaborated with us is they believe that we will reduce the velocity we’ll increase the velocity and reduce the replacement cycle of lighting sales because it would be so easy to replace your light.

And you’ve seen already for two seasons, we’ve got the Christmas tree that you plugged in. So we all these products, these are already sell selling on our websites. These are landed already with the plugs ready to go, and we have patents on all of those recess lighting, which is the massive lighting, and global patents and the exit signs, of course, for commercial and emergency lights. And then the fans, we announced a fan that we’re launching and getting great demand for our an all in one fan that we’ve that we’ve have a global patent score. It’s a fan and a heater.

And, for all season, the big box stores, we believe, will be very interested in this and are very interested in this. We did a press release yesterday. And the turbofan below, fan to cool, and the same thing. It was two different styles. And what we didn’t know, thinking we’re smart sometimes, we know it all, but we didn’t know that these big box stores have a big problem with these box heaters that the people do have fires and and injuries and death, and they sue the manufacturer, and they sue the retailer.

And having these heaters off the floor is why we designed it for safety, but we didn’t realize that these corporate these enterprises, there’s a whole there’s a whole risk, issue for them as well, for liability. So this is a major product. We this is a product we believe will get us to cash flow positive by the end of this year. And, of course, it’s smart. It comes with all our smart features.

It’s incredible. So maybe with that, I will see if there’s any q and a. And we’re and I could do quickly one question is and I I’m not sure what the there was a referral about ANSI and NEMA. The the ANSI and NEMA has already approved the product. I I think it’s unrelated to what the regulators do, but it does help.

The and, again, the mandate opportunities are broader now with other government agencies. And I apologize for the sound getting cut off. Another another quick question is how is the pipeline of new partners and distributors? Some of them are you know, the pipeline’s good. We we just I mean, we just announced the smart city, which is massive in a quant in unit opportunity.

1ljmflk,2025-06-24,"These 3 Nuclear Stocks Should Be on Your Energy Radar $DNN $NXE $PDN
* Trump boosts nuclear sector with sweeping reforms, including faster reactor approvals, expanded uranium mining, and new federal reactor sites.
* Big Tech strikes landmark nuclear deals as Meta and Microsoft secure 20-year power purchase agreements with Constellation Energy to power AI data centers off-grid.
* Investors eye uranium surge with top stock picks like Denison Mines, NexGen Energy, and Paladin Energy offering high upside amid renewed interest in nuclear power.

https://preview.redd.it/n7gov00msx8f1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b094839574b7f8c2c67cf56422cd0a6f39d8bc2

Nuclear energy stocks have been on a tear again after U.S. President Donald Trump signed executive orders that will facilitate the expansion of nuclear energy production, including expediting the regulatory approvals for new nuclear reactors. The Trump administration intends to reform the nuclear energy sector by overhauling the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), allowing the DoE to build nuclear reactors on federally-owned land, enhancing research at the U.S. Department of Energy and expanding domestic uranium mining and enrichment.

And, Big Tech companies are seizing this opportunity to secure cheap, abundant power supplies for their power-hungry AI data centers. Shares of America’s leading nuclear power plant operator, **Constellation Energy Corp.** (NYSE:CEG), have surged more than 15% after the company unveiled on Tuesday an agreement to sell more than 1,100 MW of nuclear power to **Meta Platforms** (NASDAQ:META) from its Illinois nuclear plant for 20 years. 

According to *The Wall Street Journal*, the deal is the first deal of its kind[ ](https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/meta-signs-nuclear-power-deal-to-fuel-its-ai-ambitions-70c85367)for an operating nuclear plant in the United States, and closely mirrors a similar deal Constellation signed with **Microsoft Corp.** (NASDAQ:MSFT) last year. The Microsoft deal is a 20-year power purchase agreement  (PPA) that will see Constellation Energy restart its undamaged reactor in Three Mile Island, which was undergoing decommissioning. 

Neither deal will draw power from the main grid. However, Meta appears to have secured a better deal, with Citi’s Ryan Levine estimating that the 20-year PPA is priced in the $70-$95/MWh range, considerably cheaper than  Jefferies' estimate of at least $110/MWh for Microsoft's PPA, because Meta’s deal “…*does not offer a substantial premium for low-carbon nuclear power”*. Levine has projected that \~70% of Constellation's existing nuclear plants could secure comparable datacenter deals at \~$80/MWh.

Constellation is unlikely to be the only nuclear power producer that will see surging power demand under a Trump administration that refuses to put a premium on low-carbon energy. Nuclear stocks have mostly taken a breather after a scorching rally triggered by Russia’s war in Ukraine. However, here are 3 nuclear stocks with significant upside.

**Denison Mines Corp.**

**Consensus Price Target: $4.04**

**Implied 12- Month Upside Potential: 148%**

**Denison Mines Corp.**(NYSE:DNN) engages in the exploration, acquisition and development of uranium properties in Canada. Denison has become a Wall Street favorite, with BMO analyst Alexander Pearce saying the stock’s price-to-net present value ratio of 0.9x is one of the most attractive in its group, with clear near-term catalysts. Denison boasts one of the sector’s strongest balance sheets, critical for funding modest capital requirements for its 2.2M lbs Phoenix In-Situ Uranium Recovery project.

Last month, Denison reported Q1 2024 revenue of C$1.38M, good for +66.3% Y/Y growth while quarterly loss of $0.03 per share missed the Wall Street consensus by $0.01. The company achieved \~75% completion of total engineering for Phoenix, and has committed $67 million for long-lead capital purchases. 

**NexGen Energy**

**Consensus Price Target: $12.85**

**Implied 12- Month Upside Potential: 102%**

**NexGen Energy Ltd.** (NYSE:NXE), is a Canadian exploration and development stage company that develops uranium properties in Canada. The company  holds a 100% interest in the Rook I project in southwestern Athabasca Basin of Saskatchewan, totaling an area of \~35,065 hectares. Back in March, NXE shares surged after the company revealed that recent drilling at its Rook I site intersected a rich uranium concentration at its Patterson Corridor East property, the largest development-stage uranium deposit in Canada. According to the company, drillhole RK-25-232 unveiled rich uranium concentration, making it one of the shallowest high-grade intersections at Patterson Corridor.

""D*iscovering mineralization of this intensity so early in our 2025 program outpaces the success pattern experienced at the Arrow deposit*,"" CEO Leigh Curyer said.

**Paladin Energy**

**Consensus Price Target: $5.08**

**Implied 12-Month Upside Potential: 21.5%**

**Paladin Energy Ltd** (ASX:PDN TSX: PDN OTCQX:PALAF) is an independent uranium developer with a 75% stake in Namibia’s Langer Heinrich Mine. Last year, Paladin acquired Canada’s **Fission Uranium Corp**., with the company now operating an extensive portfolio of uranium assets across Canada. Paladin is positioning itself as a significant player in baseload energy provision in multiple countries across the globe and contributing to global decarbonization.

Last month, Paladin reported Q3 revenue of $60.97M and GAAP EPS of $0.06. Uranium sales for the quarter were 872,000 pounds, at an average price of $69.90 per pound. The Langer Heinrich property produced 745,000 pounds of uranium, good for a 17% increase on the previous quarter's production to bring total production to over 2 million pounds in the financial year-to-date.

1ljfh7e,2025-06-24,"New to the Watchlist: FOMO – Formation Metals Inc.
With all the buzz around electrification and energy security, this small-cap critical minerals play just landed on my radar. $FOMO is focused on securing North American supply chains for key battery metals like cobalt and nickel materials the U.S. and Canada now consider strategic for clean energy and defense. I will be covering this stock over the upcoming weeks and diving deeper into their financials! 

Chart-wise, FOMO is up 250% since inception back in late 2024. We’re currently seeing signs of stabilization after a pullback from the recent \~$0.42 highs. The volume continues to trend up on green days and the average has been increasing over the past few months. If accumulation continues here, this could be an interesting setup heading into the second half of the year.

There is support at $.30 and just below that might be a great stop loss. After the small pullback yesterday the risk to reward got even better.

**Why I’m Watching:**

* Domestic cobalt and nickel asset in a mining-friendly jurisdiction
* Lean cap structure and new management team
* Aligned with ESG, EV, and defense sector priorities
* Under-the-radar name as capital starts rotating back into energy transition plays
* FOMO is aiming to become a key link in the critical minerals value chain.

1ljbdvl,2025-06-24,"Anyone looking into $RZLV?
Hey guys, anyone been looking into Rezolve AI? They announced yesterday that they'll be joining the Russell 2000 & 3000 Indexes. They also recently announced that they've hit $70 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) through customer contracts and are now targeting $100 million ARR by year-end.

They also have Partnerships with Microsoft and Google to integrate their AI tools into Azure and Google Cloud Marketplace.

lmk thoughts  

ngl $RZLV kinda came outta nowhere for me. hitting $70M ARR already and now landing in the russell? feels like ppl are still sleeping on it. the cloud partnerships make it more than just another AI play too. might dig in deeper. thx Rezolve is SOUN without the hype with an excellent business model. I was a SOUN shareholder, but sold for a 100 percent profit, and bought Rezolve AI. You can't buck the market, head to head Rezolve is a better investment than SOUN.  Probably too late to buy in tbh If they keep landing contracts at that pace, this could be an under-the-radar gem. Just took a look at their chart today...WOW! Its a solid company, high growth. IDK if their business model is very effective though, ai for shopping seems unnecessary and not that big to me. But its just my opinion target price is around 6$ so there is still some room It IPO’d around $10 when it didn’t have the fundamentals to be trading that high, now it’s quickly gaining the fundamentals and momentum. This is definitely going to run back to $10 a share, probably fairly quickly. RZLV was slept on after their IPO and rightfully so, but now they’ve made the moves to justify serious excitement and a very bullish outlook. I wouldn’t be surprised to see $20 per share in 18 months. Wow I really like what I am seeing from them. Could be a 10x bagger in a decade. Shopify like. Fantastic platform and great partnerships.

1liakyq,2025-06-23,"Analysis That is Fool Regard Proof
I rarely see people post actual valuation analysis on stocks on here. I see pump info, ChatGPT queries, and horrific leaps of logic with no research. I'm going to show my analysis again on a stock, but with a TWIST.

ELTP has an earnings call in one week. When they do - I am GUARANTEEING fiscal year record breaking revenues, and, if they early announce Q1 earnings next week (since the quarter will have technically ended the day before), then I am GUARANTEEING YOY record breaking revenue for the quarter. I'll accept monetary bets up to $100 per poster, or I will accept a ban from this sub if I'm wrong on either of those points.

Now, I'll first post my (brief version) analysis on the valuation of this company and then show the regard proof version.

Current revenue: $70 million (from current Adderall and other drug revenue)  <--Edited to add this comment in parentheses

Future revenue: $400 million (from 33% less market penetration in Vyvanse, HydroCod, and Percocet than our current penetration in Adderall) <---Edited to add this comment in parentheses

$470 million X 6 multiplier = $2.82 billion or **$2.82 per share (approx.)**

Plus $1 for anti abuse technology, Oxy lawsuit win, and other small drugs = **$3.82 per share.**

Let's add our Regard filter here: Cut the anticipated share price by 33% because you want to pretend I'm regarded and all of my variables are overly aggressive. **Ok, so, $2.56 per share?** Are you kidding? Even if I'm full regard it's $2.56 a share? Ok ok ok...wait. What if I'm ***KING OF THE REGARDS?*** Ok, then let's take another 33% off due to your abusive epithets....and we **are STILL at $1.72 per share?!??!?!?!?!?!?!? ARE YOU FOR REAL?!**

That's unbelievable. a 77 cent stock that should still be worth $1.72 even if the King of the Regard's analysis is Regard\^2.

Wow...but, wait. It get's worse...

Elite Pharmaceuticals just got a positive BE study that they announced for a **$27 BILLION** drug. Oh, my....

That would equal **$7.80** per share or **$5.23** per share as a regard, and **$3.50** calculated as a regard squared?!!?! These are **ADDED** to the share price above.....

Tell me a SINGLE stock, just ONE, that has the CEO announcing that the company will be bought out or uplisted in less than 14 months, and has a VERY realistic potential to 8x to 14x under REASONABLE assumptions and not even pushing up the rev numbers, the penetration numbers, OR the exit multiple. I hope that answers why I put $1 million on this stock. Not even TSLA or NVDA have this much upside from a percentage growth potential standpoint.
That’s …. not a reason. You’re basically just saying “trust me bro” Yeah. Buy almost 1% of a company and you can say “we” as well. Commenting for engagement. Been following and buying since your WSB post. You’re the man. I have \~20k in this at \~74c/share

  
See you behind the Wendy's 👍 This is OTC stock. Try Fidelity in US or IBKR in Europe. I love this question. Let me answer, what look like two separate concerns...maybe three. 

1. Short term - honestly probably bumpy. There are paid agitators whose sole job is to try and suppress this stock price. I've written about proof before, you can go look at those posts, but you'll have to trust someone who has watched them act out for the last 8 years that I can tell someone has a role to play when it's all negative posts for 8 straight years to the tune of 60k posts over a 13 year period even while GAME changing positive news comes out quarter after quarter. This is why I don't shake on the short term and mostly just keep accumulating. 

2. We would see the price go up to 90/95% of the offered price immediately. Then people trade on the gamble of the deal going through. You can liquidate at this point, or hold out for the rest of the gain when the sale closes, at which point you would receive cash (private company) or equivalent shares would be more likely if it's a public company. 

3. When to sell: Think of this like that suitcase gameshow with Howie Mandell. As the price gets closer and closer to your expected value, you have a higher motivation to unload the stock. 

Let's say I think the stock is worth $10 - I don't sell any shares at 3 cents, or 50 cents, or 75 cents. I accumulate as much as I can because the risk to reward is so high. I literally only sell if i NEED (not want) the money for another life event.

As the stock goes UP, the risk reward ratio changes. at $5, it's a 50/50 shot and I might sell a little. $9, I might sell a decent chunk because my upside is only 10% and I can make 10% in my sleep. If it went to $40 i'm selling all of it because there is a higher risk, based on my personal assessment of value, for it to go DOWN $30 than up more. Now, even at this $40 hypothetical, I could be wrong, but I would likely sell there since my risk reward ratio would tell me to sell everything. 

Hopefully that helps you, and anyone else who has this question, how to deal with knowing when to sell any asset. It works for real estate, businesses etc. I watched all the know it alls tell me this stock was worthless as it was achieving milestone after milestone. And I realized 99% of the people on here aren’t doing analysis- they are gambling. They don’t invest long in companies - they trade in and out. They don’t understand how to commit to actual value or even how to evaluate it. For instance, one know it all in this very thread is telling me “those factor are already priced in” and that “this has a PE ratio of 80” implying it is overvalued right now.

Horrible, horrible analysis. You don’t evaluate a growing company based on earnings - you base it on revs. Now, he could argue my valuation by offering his own analysis, but the people on this board never do that. They make emotional statements and wrap them in the appearance of logic. When he said “already priced in” - how? What metric did he use? What was the value of each drug and how did each one apply to the prior value of the stock? Then people will compare it to Teva on the flip side and completely discount the history of both companies. Teva was almost run in to the ground by the founders son after he used it as a piggy bank and ran up a whole bunch of debt on deals that weren’t priced right. Now that the new CEO is in TEVA, they are performing wonderfully….but they still have like $17 or $18 billion in debt. So comparing ELTPs value if we hit similar revenue is silly….because we have zero debt as of June 2nd, unless Nasrat extended the Notes, but if so that’s still only like $2 or $3 million of debt. Oh, and btw, another HUGE sign to invest in a company. When the debt on the company is lent by a board member and another $1 million by the CEO. Huge signs that a C suite will do everything they can to make the company successful. If she wants to upgrade, I'll take my wife changing money and by Wendy...and maybe the Wendy's as well. $3.60/$3.80 I think was very fair based on Adderall penetration. Sales team is just THAT good. 

But now with the new bio equivalence for a $27 billion dollar drug...I'm not sure how you get to anything less than $5.25 to $7. TEVA is $18 ish dollars and they are STRADDLED with debt. We have none... Dec 2020 but accelerated buying over two years. Price target is minimum $3.60 - high end $17 ish. My reasons are in a few of my recent posts. My successes in the past have more to do with businesses, real estate, buying/selling money or buying discounted assets. lol I also listened to the earnings call. Thats already priced in. The CEO also said don’t use January numbers to extrapolate. Market Cap is already $800m. Operating income is $10-12m. That’s like a 80x PE.

1les1cx,2025-06-18,"GLMD- Massive Breakout Coming!
GLMD is setting up for something massive, and I’ve been watching it closely.

Here’s what nobody’s catching:
	•	Only 4M float. That’s micro.
	•	Over $20M in cash, no debt, cleanest balance sheet I’ve seen at this level.
	•	They’ve got a sublingual semaglutide play (yes, the same ingredient in Ozempic) — but this one is under the tongue, NOT injectable.
	•	Licensing deal already in motion, term sheet signed, finalizing soon.
	•	They just uncovered a biomarker signature that could expand their drug into inflammation and heart/metabolic conditions.
	•	Active cancer trial. Active MASH program. ZERO attention.

Meanwhile, short interest is climbing, and nobody’s priced in any of this. No promos, no pumpers, no scanners lighting up yet. Just a quiet powder keg.

 I’ve done the digging, and the setup is stupid obvious.

All I’m saying is if GLMD drops news while short interest is still stacked, it’s going to rip.
And not just a little pop. I mean full-on rerate, liquidity choke, halt-city type of move.

Most of you will read this and forget it. Some of you will come back later wondering how you missed it.
I’m already in. I’ll be louder when it’s obvious.

Watch GLMD. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

”Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (GLMD), traders beware. Potential pump and dump scam.”

From an other thread some time ago. There are these few accounts that post about this company all the time.  All Pharma stocks are a pump and dump 100% of the time Only thing you forgot to mention that the company resides in a country that is in an active war with two other countries at this very moment. Doesnt really build trust to this company.  I see 40% decline in the past 6 months and 30% in the past 3 months. The further back you go the bigger the decline gets. Are we looking at the same charts? 

“Pump and dump!” the bear’s favorite term when they’re scared and short.

Imagine traders posting non stop about a biotech stock like $GLMD you know, one with a billion dollar GLP-1 catalyst, no debt, cash on hand, and trading 90% under its fair value. What a scam, right? 😂🤣

It’s almost like people post when they find something undervalued. Not really that hard to understand.

The float’s tight, shorts are sweating, and every day we get closer to catalyst windows. But sure, keep yelling “scam” while we load at levels you’ll wish you bought.

I know you wanted it to be for your own shorting interests but this isn’t a pump, get ready for the ride of your life. 🩳 That’s what I told myself when I bought SEDG at $60 a year ago. Ok so 95% pump & dump, you have convinced me I’ve been in this stock for about three weeks. I have no idea about the long-term potential but I like the setup with potential catalysts and tiny mkt cap / micro float. Seems like it ran last fall, could be a fun one. 

I’ve also done like an hour of DD so don’t quote me on anything.

Edit: Two other thoughts. 1. I like to gamble so take this for what it is. 2. Part of my rationale is that algos could pick up on the oral semaglutide term sheet and pump this thing. We shall see. Because the people in this thread don’t seem to understand why they’re here. All penny stocks could potentially get pump and dumped, that’s what happens with a super low market cap. Everyone’s afraid to take the jump into something before it jumps and it’s easier to criticize than to critically think. They’ll gladly FOMO in though after the price has surged Sir, this is r/pennystocks, we are never talking about “good companies” lol

1legnyl,2025-06-18,"MIRA Pharmaceuticals' Lead Drug Candidate Ketamir-2 First Manuscript Accepted For Publication In The Peer-Reviewed Journal Frontiers In Pharmacology
MIRA Pharmaceuticals, a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics for neurologic, neuropsychiatric, and metabolic disorders, today announced that the first manuscript describing its lead drug candidate Ketamir-2, currently being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial for neuropathic pain, has been accepted for publication in the peer- reviewed journal Frontiers in Pharmacology.  
  
The article, titled **'KETAMIR-2, A NEW MOLECULAR ENTITY AND NOVEL KETAMINE ANALOG'**; authored by Itzchak Angel, Ph.D., MIRA’s Chief Scientific Advisor, highlights Ketamir-2’s pharmacological differentiation from ketamine and its potential as a next-generation CNS therapeutic.  
  
**Peer Review Validates Differentiated Pharmacology and Safety**  
Acceptance into Frontiers in Pharmacology provides external scientific validation by independent experts, underscoring the rigor and credibility of MIRA’s research. The publication confirms that Ketamir-2 was specifically engineered to overcome limitations associated with ketamine—such as poor oral bioavailability, dissociative side effects, and non-specific receptor binding.

1le2bus,2025-06-17,"THE NEXT 10X PENNY STOCK $WWR
Ticker: WWR (NYSE-American)
Market Cap: ~$39M
Sector: Critical Minerals / Battery Materials
Stage: Pre-revenue, nearing commercialization
Investment Thesis: One of the only pure-play domestic graphite developers positioned to power the U.S. EV and battery revolution. Fully integrated project. Government-backed. Offtake-secured. De-risked. Dirt cheap.

⸻

What is WWR?

Westwater Resources is a U.S.-based critical minerals company developing the Coosa Graphite Project in Alabama along with the Kellyton Processing Plant, which will produce battery-grade coated spherical purified graphite (CSPG) — the #1 material by volume in EV batteries.

WWR is targeting first commercial production in 2026, with offtake agreements already in place and financing well underway. The company also holds an optional upside in vanadium, another high-value critical metal used in energy storage and defense applications.

⸻

Why Buy Now?
	1.	The U.S. Has Zero Commercial Graphite Production
China controls over 80% of global graphite refining. The U.S. classifies graphite as a strategic material, and federal policy now strongly favors domestic development. WWR is one of the only near-term U.S. suppliers with real assets and infrastructure already under construction.
	2.	Fully Integrated and De-risked
WWR owns the mine (Coosa) and the processing plant (Kellyton). This vertical integration means lower costs, higher control, and higher margins. Phase I of the Kellyton plant is under construction, and over 85% of equipment has already been delivered.
	3.	Offtake Agreements Secured
WWR has already sold 100% of its Phase I production — including long-term agreements with SK On (a major Korean EV battery manufacturer) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. The demand is real.
	4.	Financing is Coming Together
A $150M debt financing package is awaiting syndication approval. In addition, the U.S. EXIM Bank has issued a Letter of Interest, backing the project under the federal “Make More in America” initiative.
	5.	Patent-Protected Purification Technology
WWR holds a patent on its CSPG purification process, which avoids harmful chemicals and allows for environmentally compliant production. This gives them a potential cost and ESG edge.
	6.	Massive Resource Scale
The Coosa deposit spans 42,000 acres and contains one of the largest known flake graphite resources in the contiguous U.S.

Phase II economic modeling:
	•	$1.4B pre-tax NPV
	•	31.8% IRR
	•	$6.3B in life-of-mine cash flow

The company trades at a ~$39M market cap.
	7.	Vanadium Upside
The Coosa deposit also contains vanadium — used in batteries and military-grade steel. This could be monetized with minimal additional investment.
	8.	Strong Policy Tailwinds
WWR is positioned to benefit from:

	•	Tariffs on Chinese graphite
	•	Bipartisan support for critical minerals
	•	DOD interest in domestic battery supply
	•	Federal project financing (EXIM, DOE)

	9.	Valuation Disconnect
Despite billions in modeled value, secured offtakes, and construction already underway, the company still trades under $1. This is a classic asymmetric opportunity.

⸻

Upcoming Catalysts
	•	Final close of $150M debt facility
	•	EXIM loan approval
	•	Full plant commissioning in 2025–2026
	•	First commercial graphite sales
	•	Phase II expansion update
	•	Vanadium development news

⸻

Bottom Line

WWR is a rare opportunity in U.S. strategic minerals: a small, overlooked company with a massive asset, locked-in demand, patented technology, and momentum toward production. If they hit their milestones, this stock has room to run — fast. My position is 5000 shares. Join me in the wave.
Batteries are where investors go to die have you forgotten abt the top tier penny stock kulr, trust me they r superr big on batteries totally didn't pop bcuz of buying bitcoin a while back Not touching anything that has to do with critical minerals while Capt Crazy Pants is in the white house. I bought at $1, sold at $4, read about BTC on balance sheets and thought holy hell the CEO just ruined the company nobody takes it serious since what a joke! Then that includes:

Anything space, transportation, defense, ev, mining, semiconductors, oil, gas, and definitely not anything gaming related. 

I suppose you could buy dirt.

It's not if, it's when...except that the when isn't even an if either. It should be before August of 2026. Fintel is one of those things that people crutch on to do research for them. If those types of tools were always right, there would be no delta to make in the market. 

I've done a legitimate 8 years of research on this stock. I invested when everyone told me it looked awful.

1ldvuci,2025-06-17,"The Oil Investor’s Dilemma: Where Should Oil Investors Place Their Bet?
***Reactivation Bargains or Frontier Blue Sky?***

When it comes to junior oil exploration, strategy and geography make all the difference.

James Bay Resources ($JBR) is working to restart legacy production in Nigeria’s OML 90 block, a field with known reserves but plenty of baggage. Between regulatory hurdles, political risk, and aging infrastructure, it’s a classic reactivation play in a complex operating environment.

Meanwhile, Supernova Metals ($SUPR.CN), soon to be Oregen Energy, is taking a cleaner, more forward-looking approach: early-stage positioning in Namibia’s Orange Basin, one of the most active and high-potential exploration frontiers globally. With Shell, TotalEnergies, and Galp all making multi-billion-barrel discoveries nearby, interest in this basin has surged. SUPR’s interest in Block 2712A puts it directly on the map, not for reviving old wells, but for chasing the next wave of transformational offshore discoveries.

In a world hungry for new supply and long-cycle barrels, especially as global oil demand continues to climb, the contrast couldn’t be clearer:

$JBR is looking backward, reviving what once was.

$SUPR.CN is looking ahead, betting on what’s next.

Which strategy gets rewarded more: reactivation or first-mover frontier positioning?

1ld1xqh,2025-06-16,"Blue M00n Metals ($M00N / $BMOOF) Just Blasted Their Way Underground, Europe’s Copper Supply Gets Real
Zeros in the title because we can't say that forbidden word on here. Anyways junior maximalists: Blue Moon Metals just dropped some hard news on the next chapter of their Nussir copper project in Norway, and it’s feeling like the kind of operational milestone that’s long overdue for a rerate.

On June 12, they completed the first blast in the access portal, a full 2,500 m decline that’s now officially underway ahead of schedule. That might sound like standard mining corridor talk, but remember: getting underground is the point where a mining story goes from geological promise to engineering reality.

Why it matters? This decline isn’t just a tunnel, it’s the artery that will feed all the future underground drilling, engineering data collection, and eventual production infrastructure. Blue Moon’s contractor, LNS (a big Norwegian name in tunneling), built it fast and smart. And if the next 12 months of underground exploration go even half right, they’ll have everything needed to make that final investment decision around 2026.

And get this, this blast follows a June 5 announcement that the EU Commission designated Nussir as a “Strategic Critical Raw Material Project” under their Critical Raw Materials Act. That essentially stamps Nussir as a priority for Europe’s supply chain diversification strategy, unlocks better access to funding, grants, and political support, all while positioning Blue Moon as a potential clean copper supplier powered by renewables.

Execution wise, they’ve been checking boxes all year: appointing new VP Mining on April 21, moving to OTCQX in mid April, and locking in port and infrastructure through a $16M plus industrial land acquisition in March. That stream of deliverables is becoming a pattern.

**Why this could become a game changer:**

At roughly a C$160M market cap and over 51 million shares outstanding , Blue Moon’s valuation still feels cautious. But the combination of EU strategic support, on time underground construction, and engineering forward exploration means they’re a few steps closer to production than most TSXV juniors. If this keeps tracking smoothly into 2026, the story shifts from hopeful to real.

Now, drilling underground isn’t sexy, it’s grams and tonnes and timeline based inflection risk. But this is exactly the kind of de-risking event that often unlocks rerates. Momentum from execution matters just as much, if not more, than a flashy drill result.

**TL;DR:**

Blue Moon just delivered the first underground blast at Nussir ahead of schedule, a milestone event that separates them from the “hovering juniors” in the space. They’re now positioned as an EU backed critical miner with the infrastructure and execution chops to hit the final investment decision. Definitely one I’d keep on the radar through 2025.

1ld1mp5,2025-06-16,"Rare Earth Boom Is On – But One U.S. Miner Is Still Deeply Undervalued: Meet NioCorp ($NB)
As stocks like $MP, $USAR, and $TMC soar with renewed investor interest in critical and rare earth minerals, **NioCorp Developments ($NB)** remains **massively undervalued**—despite having a **fully permitted, near shovel-ready project** in the U.S. with strong economics.



# 🧠 The Hidden Gem: Elk Creek Project

* Located in Nebraska, the **Elk Creek Project** is **one of the world's richest sources** of **niobium, scandium, and titanium**, with rare earth elements as potential upside.
* 2022 Feasibility Study:
   * **Pre-tax NPV (8%)**: US $2.35 billion
   * **IRR**: 29%
   * **38-year mine life**
* Permits already secured. Just awaiting financing and final investment decision (FID).



🧑‍💼 A Proven CEO with Skin in the Game

**Mark A. Smith**, CEO & Executive Chairman, brings:

* 40+ years in mining and critical materials.
* Former CEO of **Molycorp** (then the largest U.S. rare earth miner).
* Led **over $3 billion** in project capital raises.
* Is **NioCorp’s largest individual shareholder**—strong alignment with retail investors.



# 📊 Rare Earth Stocks Are Booming — But Look at the Valuations

|Company|Market Cap|Stage|Revenue|Asset Valuation|Price-to-Asset Value Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
||
|**MP Materials ($MP)**|\~$6.5B|Production|Yes|\~$4.5B NPV|\~1.4×|
|**USA Rare Earth ($USAR)**|\~$300M–400M|Development|No|\~Early-stage|\~0.3–0.4×|
|**The Metals Company ($TMC)**|\~$1.5B|Exploration|No|Highly speculative|\>1×|
|**NioCorp ($NB)**|**\~$160M**|Permitted/Pre-FID|No|**$2.35B NPV**|**\~0.07×** ❗️|



# 💥 If $NB was valued like its peers…

|If valued like…|Implied Market Cap|Stock Price (Est.)|
|:-|:-|:-|
||
|**USAR (\~0.4×)**|\~$940M|\~$18.50–20/share|
|**MP (\~1.4×)**|\~$3.3B|\~$65–70/share|
|**Even a modest 0.3× NPV**|\~$700M|\~$14/share|

📉 Current stock price? Just **\~$3/shar**e. That’s a **potential 4×–20× upsid**e.



# 🔜 Catalysts on Deck

* Engineering & updated feasibility work ongoing.
* U.S. Export-Import Bank term sheet being finalized—potential **$800M+ financing**.
* Final Investment Decision (FID) expected in 2025.
* Rare earth policy tailwinds from the U.S. government’s domestic supply chain push.



# ✅ The Bottom Line

While other rare earth stocks surge, **NioCorp remains overlooked**, trading at **just 7% of its project’s value**. Backed by a **seasoned CEO**, a **fully permitted U.S. asset**, and an improving macro backdrop, NB could **easily re-rate 5x–10x** as capital flows return to critical mineral plays.

🔎 **Don’t sleep on NioCorp. The rare earth boom is here—and this is your chance to get in before the market wakes up**.

  

I can't find any evidence of congressmen invested in them...not a good sign Thanks Chat GPT Really good DD that I definitely read 🤖. Which REEs do they have, and grades with commodity breakdown? What's the reserve, resource, annual production? CAPEX needed? Ramp up time? Construction time? Off take agreements? Who will process? Will they produce REO, concentrate, or separate the metals? Why did they use NPV8? What WACC are we looking at?

If you're going to do a ChatGPT dive, you should have some answers that investors actually would ask, not just generic high level bullet points

^(if) ^(you) ^(have) ^(any) ^(questions) ^(or) ^(concerns.) Don’t forget the addition to Russell 3000 **Great question — here’s the most current, verifiable info on the $800M EXIM loan for NioCorp ($NB):**

✅ In **May 2024**, NioCorp announced it received a **non-binding indicative term sheet from the U.S. Export-Import Bank (EXIM)** for **up to $800 million** in project financing for the Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project in Nebraska.

🧾 This was not just a Letter of Interest — it’s an actual financing structure under review, with **JPMorgan Chase advising** NioCorp on how to structure the debt.

📌 As of **February 2025**, EXIM officially advanced the project into **TRC-2**, the second of three formal technical review stages required before board approval. These reviews are rigorous and focus on:

* Environmental & permitting compliance (✅ already in place),
* Updated mineral resource data (in progress),
* Offtake agreements and economic modeling (pending finalization).

🛠 In **April 2025**, NioCorp began a **12-week in-fill drilling program** to support a feasibility update aligned with EXIM’s requirements — this demonstrates real alignment with EXIM’s due diligence expectations, not just words.

🌍 In **May 2025**, NioCorp also received a **non-binding Expression of Interest for $200M** in loan guarantees from **UK Export Finance (UKEF)** — giving the project **multi-agency international backing** and reducing EXIM’s standalone risk.

# 🔑 Bottom Line:

* NioCorp’s Elk Creek project is one of the **only fully permitted niobium-scandium projects in the Western Hemisphere**, and the **first critical minerals project to advance this far through EXIM’s technical review.**
* The $800M loan isn’t a rumor — it’s part of a documented, multi-phase federal review with major banking support.
* All signs point to a **potential final funding decision later in 2025**, pending TRC-3 completion.",4,0.63,9,0,ThanosTheBalanced,pennystocks,['META'],rare earth boom one us miner still deeply undervalued meet niocorp nb stocks like mp usar tmc soar renewed investor interest critical rare earth minerals niocorp developments nb remains massively undervalueddespite fully permitted near shovelready project us strong economics hidden gem elk creek project located nebraska elk creek project one worlds richest sources niobium scandium titanium rare earth elements potential upside 2022 feasibility study pretax npv 8 us 235 billion irr 29 38year mine life permits already secured awaiting financing final investment decision fid proven ceo skin game mark smith ceo executive chairman brings 40 years mining critical materials former ceo molycorp largest us rare earth miner led 3 billion project capital raises niocorps largest individual shareholderstrong alignment retail investors rare earth stocks booming look valuations companymarket capstagerevenueasset valuationpricetoasset value ratio mp materials mp65bproductionyes45b npv14 usa rare earth usar300m400mdevelopmentnoearlystage0304 metals company tmc15bexplorationnohighly speculative1 niocorp nb160mpermittedprefidno235b npv007 nb valued like peers valued likeimplied market capstock price est usar 04940m185020share mp 1433b6570share even modest 03 npv700m14share current stock price 3share thats potential 420 upside catalysts deck engineering updated feasibility work ongoing us exportimport bank term sheet finalizedpotential 800m financing final investment decision fid expected 2025 rare earth policy tailwinds us governments domestic supply chain push bottom line rare earth stocks surge niocorp remains overlooked trading 7 projects value backed seasoned ceo fully permitted us asset improving macro backdrop nb could easily rerate 5x10x capital flows return critical mineral plays dont sleep niocorp rare earth boom hereand chance get market wakes cant find evidence congressmen invested themnot good sign thanks chat gpt really good dd definitely read rees grades commodity breakdown whats reserve resource annual production capex needed ramp time construction time take agreements process produce reo concentrate separate metals use npv8 wacc looking youre going chatgpt dive answers investors actually would ask generic high level bullet points submission fit subreddit please upvote comment fit subreddit please downvote comment bot comment made automatically please contact us via modmail questions concerns dont forget addition russell 3000 great question heres current verifiable info 800m exim loan niocorp nb may 2024 niocorp announced received nonbinding indicative term sheet us exportimport bank exim 800 million project financing elk creek critical minerals project nebraska letter interest actual financing structure review jpmorgan chase advising niocorp structure debt february 2025 exim officially advanced project trc2 second three formal technical review stages required board approval reviews rigorous focus environmental permitting compliance already place updated mineral resource data progress offtake agreements economic modeling pending finalization april 2025 niocorp began 12week infill drilling program support feasibility update aligned exims requirements demonstrates real alignment exims due diligence expectations words may 2025 niocorp also received nonbinding expression interest 200m loan guarantees uk export finance ukef giving project multiagency international backing reducing exims standalone risk bottom line niocorps elk creek project one fully permitted niobiumscandium projects western hemisphere first critical minerals project advance far exims technical review 800m loan isnt rumor part documented multiphase federal review major banking support signs point potential final funding decision later 2025 pending trc3 completion

1lczeda,2025-06-16,"Nuclear tensions are rising — is CPSH quietly preparing for the next defense cycle?
With the Iran-Israel conflict reigniting fears of nuclear escalation, there’s been a noticeable uptick in conversations around missile defense, radiation shielding, and military-grade thermal management systems.

While most investors focus on large defense contractors, CPS Technologies (CPSH) tends to fly under the radar. Yet this company specializes in advanced materials  particularly metal matrix composites  that are engineered to withstand extreme thermal environments. Their components are used in aerospace, military, and energy systems where heat dissipation and durability are mission-critical.

They’ve worked with the Department of Defense in the past, and while they don’t make weapons directly, they seem to operate in the kind of niche that becomes essential during high-stress defense cycles especially when nuclear deterrence and thermal resilience come back into focus.

Not suggesting this is a hidden gem, not pumping. Just wondering if anyone else sees the geopolitical shift as something that might indirectly benefit companies like CPSH.

1lcvlp7,2025-06-16,"Roadzen's drivebuddyAI partners with SUPERGAS aiming to enhances LPG Fleet Safety implementing ADAS with integrated Transport Operations Command Centre
drivebuddyAI’s, an Indian ADAS & Automotive-AI company has announced its partnership with SHV Energy Pvt Ltd \[popularly known as ‘SUPERGAS’\] – a leading Private LPG Company in India, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Dutch Multinational SHV Energy N.V. one of the world leaders in LPG business, for implementing real-time driver safety using in-cabin ADAS AI dashcam & cloud-based command center. 

As a part of the engagement, drivebuddyAI will deploy its multi-patented AI platform, drivebuddyAI ADAS & AMCS camera-based product equipped with locally developed AI & Computer Vision technologies to alert drivers in real-time for risks such as drowsiness, distractions, smoking, collision warning & seatbelt non-compliances. The complete implementation also involves 24×7 running Transport Operations Command Centre setup at SUPERGAS to monitor drivers with intelligent command center, taking pro-active actions to avoid any possibility of accidents or any misconduct of drivers on the road.  

SUPERGAS has taken this initiative of implementing ADAS cameras on the transporter’s trucks moving LPG from its filling plant and LPG storage terminal locations using the fleet of 500+ trucks and installation is expected to be finished by September 2025.  SUPERGAS is committed towards enhancing safety and setting up a benchmark of taking road safety as one of the most critical aspects in its operations with in-depth analytics of driver behavior, driver coaching, route risk assessment and journey risk management to enhance logistics operations with data-driven decision-making process.  SUPERGAS has been working with drivebuddyAI since more than 6 months validating the product and integrating the capabilities to scale up to achieve significant reduction in road accidents and aiming it to run operations with zero fatalities and optimized logistics with automation.  

“Working with SUPERGAS has been a great experience and learning for us. LPG transportation being one of the high-risk logistics segments and we’re excited to see how our AI dashcams synchronized with real-time command center will be able help SUPERGAS optimize their operations with reduced road accidents, cases of pilferage, advanced monitoring ensuring no mistakes and optimized delivery TAT for their customers.”

Just my opinion but this company will eventually be bought out by the likes of Google or Microsoft! Holding for the WIN! People don’t realize the big money doesn’t come from these AI companies marketing to the general public.

# CISO Global: Choose Your Own Adventure

*A real business. A tight float. A setup that could go fundamental… or feral.*

# TL;DR: The Setup

CISO Global ($CISO) is a cybersecurity company trading at a \~$30.76M market cap with:

* **Real revenue**: $39M projected for 2025, EBITDA-positive
* **High-margin software**: 80%+ margin, tied to cyber insurance
* **Insider/retail locked float**: \~90% of shares not trading

https://preview.redd.it/hzexnnwt177f1.png?width=1380&format=png&auto=webp&s=200bcdc7e74c2c5734d0589bb377abda1b1a780a

* **Dark pool activity**: 60–80%+ of daily volume is off-exchange
* **Reg SHO list**: Failures to deliver = structural tension
* **Trading at less than 1x revenue**: Cybersecurity peers typically trade at **4.8x–6.7x** revenue for medium-growth companies
* **Private market multiples**: Acquisitions in cybersecurity often occur at **8–12x revenue**
* **Insiders in blackout**: Management is currently restricted from buying/selling, suggesting material news is pending.  My guess is that the end of blackout will also come with an avalanche of insider buying
* **CUSIP change trigger discussed**: Management has previously indicated that they are preparing to take action that could result in a CUSIP change—a corporate event that would force all borrowed shares to be returned, disrupting any hidden or synthetic short positions

This is either a **deep value tech play** or a **short squeeze powder keg**. Maybe both.

See how she runs:

# 🍽️ Path 1: “Meat & Potatoes” (The Fundamental Thesis)

* ✅ SOC 2 Type II certified
* ✅ $34M services + software guidance
* ✅ 93% client retention
* ✅ 80%+ gross margin product: CheckLight
* ✅ Partnered with insurance firm CAGI
* ✅ $5M+ in high-margin software bookings expected
* ✅ Software alone independently valued at $50M
* ✅ No toxic debt, no ATM usage, insider-aligned
* ✅ Built for Microsoft and AWS environments, with early traction positioning CheckLight for scalable enterprise and cloud deployment

# 🔥 Path 2: “The Pressure Cooker” (The Short Squeeze Thesis)

* 🔒 \~90% float lock-up:
   * 9.9M self-reported by Stocktwits holders
   * 18.5M known held by insiders/friends/family
* ❌ Only \~3M shares remain in the wild
* 🔀 60–80% dark pool routing = market maker internalization
* 🧾 On the NASDAQ Reg SHO list (ongoing FTDs)
* 👀 Wild volume patterns: 30M+ volume days with tiny floats
* 📉 Reported short interest is low... but behavior is not

#  Why It Matters Either Way

This isn’t AMC. It’s not GME. It’s not air.

**CISO has a business. Has revenue. Has software.**

But it also has:

* A float tighter than GameStop’s in early 2021
* Enough abnormal behavior to raise questions
* A structure that doesn’t need 100% short interest to break

#  Final Thought

If you’re here for fundamentals, there’s a case. If you’re here for fireworks, there’s a fuse. If you’re here for both... well, you’re probably not alone.

https://preview.redd.it/xh1hefi4277f1.jpg?width=4500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6f85aa2c9e166dc2770964032dd65424421a75fc

# 🔥 The Pressure Cooker Thesis: Why CISO May Be Squeeze-Prone

This is not a hype play built on hope. This is a structurally starved float wrapped around an undervalued cybersecurity business. Here’s why CISO ($CISO) is exhibiting key signals of a classic short squeeze setup:

# Locked Float: Almost Nothing Left to Trade

* **Total shares outstanding**: 32.04 million
* **Known long-term holdings**:
   * \~18.5 million held by insiders, family, and known associates
   * \~ 9.9 million self-reported held by retail (Stocktwits/Substack polls, screenshot-based tracking)
* **Estimated locked float**: \~90%+
* **What’s left?** Fewer than 3 million shares available for actual market trading.

# Why It Matters

This is **GameStop mechanics with microcap friction**. A tiny tradable float makes it easy to trap shorts and hard to find supply in a rising market.

#  Abnormal Dark Pool Activity

* **60–80% of daily volume** is regularly routed off-exchange
* **Typical small caps** might see 20–40%
* **What this suggests**:
   * Market makers may be **internalizing trades**, reducing visible price discovery
   * Could indicate **non-retail participants masking exposure** or **avoiding upward price impact**

When you’re seeing 20M+ volume days on a stock with 3M tradable shares, and most of it is off-exchange, something’s wrong.

#  Reg SHO List: Structural Pressure is Building

* CISO has appeared on the **NASDAQ Reg SHO threshold list**, indicating repeated **failures to deliver (FTDs)**
* This means broker-dealers **aren’t delivering borrowed shares on time**
* Regulation requires these positions to be closed within **13 trading days**

# What This Means

Reg SHO status is often a precursor to explosive volatility. It implies **phantom shares or naked shorting**, which cannot be sustained if real demand shows up.

#  Short Interest is Reported Low… But May Be Misleading

* **Reported short interest** is not extreme (as of last update)
* But that doesn’t account for:
   * **Synthetic shorts** through options
   * **Unreported offshore or swap-based positions**
   * **Internalized shorting** not yet reflected in disclosures

This is a **float trap** more than a pure short interest play. It’s not about 100%+ shorts. It’s about a lack of exit doors.

# Volume Surges + Illiquidity = Combustible Setup

* We’ve seen multiple **30M+ volume days** despite minimal float
* Price barely moves—why?
   * Likely internalization + short pressure + volume masking
   * Price suppression may be active or incidental, but it’s real

When the volume flips back to lit exchanges, and supply can’t meet demand, the spring can snap.

#  Timeline Catalyst: Time-Based Exposure Risk

* Each day CISO remains on Reg SHO **raises the stakes**
* If retail or institutional interest rises, shorts may be forced to cover under duress
* No dilution means **no relief valve** for those caught short

#  Precedents & Analogues

* **LODE (2021)**: Ran from \~$1 to $9 on float lockup + speculative flow
* **HKD**: Exploded on no fundamentals, purely float scarcity
* **GME**: Iconic, but what made it dangerous was float structure, not just short interest

CISO has:

* Real revenue
* Real product
* Real lockup

#  Conclusion: The Case for a Squeeze

CISO is not guaranteed to squeeze. But structurally:

* The float is unavailable
* The trading is opaque
* The regulatory pressure is building

Even without a squeeze, these factors often force **unpredictable price action**. Add news or increased interest, and this setup has potential to move quickly.

It’s a spring wound tight—not by hype, but by math.

#  The ""Meat & Potatoes"" Thesis: Why CISO's Fundamentals Matter

https://preview.redd.it/rp42xdr6277f1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=c05f290da55b3315a2845bbe6911a885a7e8a60d

CISO Global ($CISO) isn’t just a possible squeeze setup—it’s a real cybersecurity company with real revenue, sticky software, and growing relevance. Here’s why the fundamentals justify serious attention.

#  Real Revenue, Not Projections

* **$39 million projected revenue** in 2025
* 2024 already marked the company’s **first EBITDA-positive quarter**
* Revenue is split between:
   * **Cybersecurity services** (recurring)
   * **Proprietary software** (high margin, scalable)

This isn’t hype revenue. These are real enterprise contracts and recurring customer relationships.

#  Recurring and Retained

* **75% of revenue is recurring**, primarily from managed cybersecurity services
* **Client retention rate is 93%**

This gives CISO a base that grows organically and reduces customer churn risk—a major valuation driver in the SaaS world.

#  CheckLight: A High-Margin Growth Engine

* **CheckLight** is CISO’s proprietary endpoint detection & response (EDR) solution
* It’s being distributed through a **cyber insurance partner (CAGI)**
* CheckLight is:
   * 80%+ gross margin
   * Bundled with policies
   * Designed for small and mid-sized enterprises
   * **$25/month** per computer, server, firewall or connected endpoint

This turns CISO from a services firm into a **scalable SaaS/software player**

#  Built for Enterprise, Backed by Giants

* CheckLight is compatible with **Microsoft** and **Amazon AWS** environments
* This enables **broad enterprise adoption** and future integration with large IT ecosystems
* These relationships increase trust and accelerate enterprise pipeline growth

#  Undervalued by the Numbers

* CISO’s **current market cap is \~$30.76M, less than 1x revenue**
* **39m Projected 2025 revenue, 30.8m revenue in 2024**
* Competitors trade at 4.8x-6.7x for medium growth cybersecurity companies
* Theor IP alone has been **independently valued at $50M**
* That’s not counting services revenue, customer base or SaaS revenue

If CheckLight meets its $5M bookings guidance and scales through insurance distribution, the stock rerates naturally

#  Clean Balance Sheet, No Games

* No active ATM dilution
* High-interest debt has been **paid off**
* Remaining convertibles are **friendly and extended**
* Management is **not selling shares and has never sold shares**

This is rare for a microcap—CISO is running clean and aligned

 **Why It Works Even Without a Squeeze**

Even without any short squeeze mechanics, CISO is positioned for rerating:

* Clear path to profitability
* High-margin product with insurance channel access
* Services backbone with strong retention
* Software with clear enterprise compatibility

This is a value stock in growth stock clothing

And if the float stays tight, fundamentals alone could force price discovery as real investors move in.

#  Final Thought

CISO isn’t just a speculative ticker—it’s a maturing cybersecurity company with upside from both performance and perception.

Whether or not the market recognizes it today, the business itself is real, scalable, and increasingly valuable.

Real revenue. Real product. Real potential. This is the meat and potatoes.

That's a long one.

But for someone new, it's helpful to decide.

Great work again PQ. I'm long-winded.... I left out soooo much Great article and analysis. In my opinion, it is harder to imagine a greater opportunity to invest in. With so few shares ""in the wild,"" how is there so much trade volume of this stock? Seems a little counterintuitive. Because it isn't real trading.  One day, it traded 66 million shares.  That is the problem and the opportunity. Since then, we've locked up much more of the float This seems like a decent opportunity 🤔 off to DD. Thanks much! I deal with cyber insurance as a day job. If they can get on the radar of the big guys like Chubb, Beazley or Hiscox, then it would get very interesting. Tell me everything you know The CUSIP change also RS **CISO Global is an early-stage growth company that has successfully turned adjusted EBITDA positive through its transition to AI-driven security software. The shift in revenue mix between its services and software divisions is expected to drive margin expansion. However, due to declining revenue, continued losses, and its micro-cap status, the company carries high liquidity and volatility risks, making it a high-risk, high-reward investment.**

**Recommended Allocation:** Limit to a restricted 1–3% of the portfolio through gradual accumulation.

**Investment Strategy:**

* Increase position after confirming momentum in adjusted EBITDA from the services segment in 2025.
* Set a stop-loss price (e.g., below $0.60) to manage short-term volatility.

One Stop Systems (OSS): The Overlooked Edge AI Defense Stock Powering Palantir’s (PLTR) Battlefield A

**Introduction and Thesis**

While AI software leaders like Palantir ($PLTR, ~$325B market cap) capture headlines, the specialized hardware enabling their platforms in mission-critical environments remains a significantly undervalued segment. This post presents an investment thesis for One Stop Systems ($OSS), a company with an ~$80M market cap (~$3/share) that builds the rugged, high-performance edge computers—the essential ""picks and shovels""—of the unfolding AI defense revolution.

The core thesis is that OSS presents a profound asymmetric risk/reward opportunity. It is a pure-play on the explosive growth of battlefield autonomy, yet trades at a microscopic fraction of its software peers. This analysis will detail verifiable, near-term catalysts and a strengthened leadership team as the foundation for a significant potential re-rating of the company's value.

---

**TL;DR: The Investment Case in Brief**

*   **The Problem:** Commercial-grade computers, even high-end ones, fail on the battlefield. Mission-critical AI requires immense local processing power (""at the edge"") that operates through extreme conditions without latency.
*   **OSS's Solution:** OSS designs military-grade supercomputers that bring data-center performance to tanks, drones, and warships, enabling real-time AI where it's needed most.
*   **Strengthened Leadership:** The recent appointment of CEO Mike Knowles, a former VP from the defense C5ISR sector (Cubic), brings deep industry experience to execute on the company's growth strategy.
*   **Verifiable Catalysts:**
    1.  **$200M+ Sole-Source Contract:** OSS is the designated provider for a U.S. Army vehicle modernization program. This single contract is valued at **~2.5x the company's entire current market cap.**
    2.  **$1 Billion Sales Pipeline:** Management has confirmed a qualified pipeline exceeding $1 billion, indicating massive, long-term demand for their technology.
*   **Primary Source:** Both catalysts are detailed in the **[Official OSS Letter to Shareholders (PDF)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/b2icontent.irpass.cc/2595/rl144894.pdf#popup)**.
*   **The Asymmetry:** An ~$80M company that is a key technology enabler for a multi-trillion dollar industry undergoing a generational tech upgrade.

### **Why Edge Computing is Non-Negotiable: A Practical Scenario**

To understand OSS's moat, contrast its technology with a traditional data-center hardware provider like Super Micro ($SMCI) or TSS ($TSSI).

*   **Data Center / Cloud Approach (The SMCI/TSSI World):** Imagine a U.S. drone swarm on a reconnaissance mission. The lead drone detects a potential mobile missile launcher. To confirm the threat, it must stream high-definition video back to a ground station, which then relays it to a remote data center for analysis. **If the enemy jams that data link, the entire swarm is rendered blind and the mission fails.** The latency is too high, and the operational risk is unacceptable.

*   **Edge AI Approach (The OSS World):** Now, imagine each drone in that swarm is equipped with an OSS rugged computer. The lead drone uses **sensor fusion**—combining its optical, thermal, and radar data—and its onboard OSS supercomputer identifies the threat in milliseconds. It doesn't need to send video; it sends a tiny, encrypted data packet to the rest of the swarm: *""Hostile missile launcher at coordinates X,Y.""* **Even if the primary link to base is jammed, the swarm can autonomously react, adapt, and neutralize the threat.**

This is the OSS advantage: **resilience, security, and zero-latency decision-making.** They are not competing with data center players; they are enabling a completely different, more critical application of AI.

---

### **Evidence of Ecosystem Alignment: Serving the Same Customers**

The synergy between AI software and rugged hardware is not theoretical. Consider these two recent developments:

1.  **Palantir's Maritime AI:** Palantir and Hyundai recently unveiled the Tenebris, an Unmanned Surface Vessel powered by Palantir's AI. Such a platform fundamentally requires a rugged, onboard computer to run its autonomous systems.
    *   *Source:* [Naval News - Palantir Reveal Tenebris USV](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2024/05/hd-hhi-and-palantir-reveal-tenebris-unmanned-surface-vessel/)

2.  **OSS's Maritime Design Win:** OSS announced a design win to provide the AI compute system for an autonomous maritime application for a major Asian defense contractor.
    *   *Source:* [GlobeNewswire - OSS Announces Maritime Design Win](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/12/03/2990581/0/en/OSS-Announces-Follow-On-Order-and-Design-Win-from-a-Leading-Defense-Contractor-in-Asia-for-an-Autonomous-Maritime-Application.html)

These announcements demonstrate that both companies are operating in parallel to solve the same problem for the same set of global defense customers. Investing in OSS is a bet on the entire trend of battlefield autonomy, not just a single software provider.

---

### **Strengthened Leadership to Execute on Growth**

A critical piece of the puzzle is leadership. In May 2024, OSS appointed Mike Knowles as CEO. Knowles isn't a generic tech executive; he joined from Cubic Corporation, where he was President of its C5ISR (Command, Control, Computers, Communications, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) division.

This means the person leading OSS has spent years selling advanced technology directly to the same military and defense contractor customers that make up OSS's target market. This significantly de-risks the ""execution"" aspect of converting their massive sales pipeline into revenue.

---

### **Catalysts for a Potential Re-rating**

**1. The Transformative Sole-Source Contract ($200M+)**
The U.S. Army has designated OSS as the sole-source provider for the computing and storage hardware for a 360° situational awareness system for its armored vehicles. ""Sole-source"" status removes competition and represents a clear path to revenue that is multiples of the company's current value.

**2. The Validated $1 Billion Sales Pipeline**
The investor presentation confirms a pipeline of over $1 billion in potential deals. This isn't a theoretical market size; these are qualified programs in autonomous logistics, electronic warfare, and next-gen avionics that OSS is actively pursuing.

---

### **Valuation: The Path to a 100x Return**

The current market disconnect is stark.

| Company | Market Capitalization | Role in AI Defense |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Palantir ($PLTR) | ~$325 Billion | AI Software & Platforms |
| Anduril (Private) | ~$30 Billion | Integrated AI Systems & Drones |
| **One Stop Systems ($OSS)** | **~$80 Million** | **Essential Rugged AI Hardware** |

A 100x return implies an $8 billion market cap. While ambitious, this is plausible in the long term for a company that becomes the ""Intel Inside"" for rugged AI hardware. To justify an $8B valuation (at a reasonable 8x Price-to-Sales), OSS would need ~$1B in annual revenue. The company's own **$1B+ qualified sales pipeline** shows that this isn't a fantasy; it's their stated roadmap of opportunity.

A simple 10x return—an $800M valuation—is substantially de-risked by the $200M sole-source contract alone.

---

### **Identified Risks**

*   **Government Timelines:** Large defense contracts can have unpredictable ramp-up schedules.
*   **Execution:** The new leadership team must successfully convert the pipeline into revenue.
*   **Micro-Cap Volatility:** The stock is subject to significant price swings and requires a long-term investment horizon.

---

### **Conclusion**

One Stop Systems offers a rare opportunity to invest in the foundational hardware layer of the AI defense boom at a compelling valuation. With new, deeply experienced leadership at the helm, a transformative sole-source contract providing a revenue floor, and a validated $1B+ pipeline showing a clear path to exponential growth, OSS is at an inflection point.

The market has not yet priced in these realities. For investors who can see the critical link between AI software and the hardware that makes it viable, OSS represents a ground-floor opportunity.

It says “IF” the defense orders their products. Also the commercial sales are “Pursuing”. This means no contracts signed. I think this is a pump and dump post 😔😔😔 If my comments come back to bite me, I’ll be glad you made some money. Right now investing in hardware is foolish. Especially in a low cap stock. Best case scenario is they get bought out. I just made a post on this too [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/s/8r0WW4O9kL)

People are starting to discover this as one of the few remaining non-pumped A.i tech plays. Being a special access Tier 2 partner to NVIDIA helps a lot too. They’re also on the brink of profitability. It’s just a shame that their executives have too much integrity to pump the stock artificially Thanks ChatGPT Did you check their contracts list? They signed multiple multi-million contract renewals with the US army and navy They put A.i capable mobile data centers in US military vehicles, so they don’t have to deal with latency or cooling issues. This is not typical “hardware” Is the 1 billion contract signed? Yes and renewed for years. It’s not billions, it’s millions. They serve all branches of the military and their market cap is only 2x their revenue

1lbymd3,2025-06-15,"The Future of Military Computing - $OSS - an Underrated A.I. Edge Computing OEM
I am primarily a large cap options trader, however, I have covered many microcaps in my life. OSS is the only microcap that I have consistently followed and seen promise in long-term. They are underrated, and one look at their financials, partnerships & military contract list will make you wonder why their market cap is so small. 

Let me make this clear, OSS is not destined to skyrocket into a large cap, but they are poised to breakout of microcap hell, which is still a great return. **I will explain the reasons why they haven't exploded yet and what institutions are waiting for, before they add more from the 18 million share float.**

**---------------------------------**

**What does One Stop Systems do?**  
$OSS is partnered with Nvidia, (OEM Tier 2 special access) to design and create extremely powerful, compact, & DURABLE A.I. & machine learning computing systems for the military and defense sector. This allows the military to have datacenter-level performance on the ""edge"" of our world and in the harshest of conditions. OSS solves the issues the military faces with datacenter latency, cooling issues, or lack of on-site control. This young sector is the future of warfare & industrial computing, and $OSS is quietly nestling themselves as one of the [""go-to"" companies for these military applications.](https://onestopsystems.com/blogs/press-releases/oss-announces-6-million-in-combined-platform-contract-renewals-for-two-existing-u-s-department-of-defense-programs)

Ask yourself, how do you expect our military to process data quickly in a desert battle or in the sky? Do you expect them to endure latency by pinging a server thousands of miles away? [Or would you rather an OSS system be there to process that data inside the tank??](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/08/22/2934176/0/en/OSS-Receives-Order-for-Rugged-Enterprise-Class-Servers-to-Support-U-S-Army.html)

$OSS delivers such a quality product, that government and autonomous vehicle programs PAID THEM over $1.5 million (from earnings call) [to research and develop systems they can use.](https://www.hpcwire.com/off-the-wire/oss-to-develop-rugged-high-performance-edge-systems-under-ussocom-agreement/)

[OSS-developed systems offer better performance and better durability/cooling than their competitors.](https://imgur.com/a/498xU5C) competing products cannot endure such harsh conditions while being this powerful at the same time.

$OSS is also on the brink of profitability, a revenue boom, and have little debt, and a consistent desire to stay lean while delivering a high-quality product. **They've also recently changed their executive team & direction to form an Avengers-like squad that can focus on serving the technological needs of the defense sector.** They are going all-in on being the high-end provider of custom edge computing systems.

\-----------------------

**So why hasn't the ticker exploded yet, if their products are so reputable?**

There are FIVE main reasons:

1. The ticker almost exploded in 2021, but at the worst possible time. Federal interest rates rose & liquidity fell out of tech microcaps, killing chart momentum. High int rates are just bad in general for business.
2. Then in 2022/23, OSS decided to upgrade/change their CEO and business model to focus on dominating the defense sector, A GOOD MOVE FOR LONG TERM GROWTH. This rose the ceiling for the company and they have an ""edge"" in this space, no pun intended. However, any CEO change will scare investors, so institutions have been waiting to make sure the change worked. [New CEO is a perfect fit](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-knowles-cubic/)
3. Despite being close to profitability, OSS slightly missed a few ERs because they purposely chose to stop serving old customers and focus on higher-margin defense contracts. This hurt the stock in the short-term as they sacrificed revenue, but in the long-run they will flourish with defense sector contracts that yield 15-20% higher margins per customer. Institutions are being patient if you watch earnings calls.
4. At the moment, there are few better options for a rugged HPC datacenter that you can embed in a military vehicle or boat. However, OSS struggles to meet the demands of their customers, with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3. Despite their products being incredible, THERE IS A BOTTLENECK SOMEWHERE.
5. Even though Nvidia has allowed them special access as a OEM tier 2, that doesn't mean that someone couldn't come along and try to compete in their price segment. They are alone right now in their price segment, but someone could try and take them down. I still believe they will emerge as a leader because these early military partnerships will force the US to stick with them, as switching system costs are extremely high due to everything being custom-built for each military vehicle/application.

\--------------------

From a share-price perspective, I like the repeated attempts to break upper resistance levels, and the float is small/volatile. However, I dislike how professional & quiet the company's leadership is. There's NOT ENOUGH funny business like we see with other pennystocks. OSS knows that their products, government contracts, and financial growth will speak for themselves in the long run, so they do nothing to artificially pump the stock. I respect this, but I wish they made a better effort to capitalize on the A.I & datacenter hype wave. This stock could be $20 already, but they choose to operate with too much integrity to not ruin their reputation. 

With the market being so volatile recently, and bluechips being so over-valued, I can foresee money gravitating towards small/micro caps for a while as we wait for political/economic issues to resolve. AKA small-cap summer. Combine that aspect with the fact that this is a tech defense firm, I recommend putting this company on your watchlist and remembering this post. The OSS story will continue to evolve as they begin to snowball into an impressive tech provider for the defense and A.I. edge computing sector. 
ngl you cooked thanks for the gains Good DD op, Stock has a good pipeline of contracts and has potential to grow 50% in a year.  Not a financial advice just an observation. Also in this one and will add on any dips.  Very undervalued and undiscovered, imo.  Thanks for the DD. Not done yet! Thanks 🙏 

I recommend people at least put it on their watchlist and study the company, it’s a very interesting firm to follow

^(if) ^(you) ^(have) ^(any) ^(questions) ^(or) ^(concerns.) Bought at 3,40 $ down to 2,20 $, had a good feeling about OSS.  Wish i had bought more at  2,20 $. I didn’t load enough there either, the average cost is around $3-$4. Their CFO actually bought 80,000 shares at $4.06 this year. he was granted those shares as RSUs, they weren't buys Thanks, they have won so many government contracts and programs lately.

1lbxy5s,2025-06-15,"Empire Metals EEE.L – Titanium Discovery Gains Momentum
Empire Metals is a UK-listed exploration company developing the Pitfield titanium project in Western Australia. The company believes it has discovered a large-scale, sediment-hosted titanium system with potential for global significance.

[https://www.empiremetals.com/](https://www.empiremetals.com/)

# Project Overview

Pitfield covers a geophysical anomaly roughly 40 km long and 8 km wide, extending to at least 5 km depth. Over 100 drill holes have confirmed widespread, shallow bedded TiO₂ mineralisation in sandstone, with grades between 4.5–8.5% TiO₂, in some cases exceeding 10%. Two key zones, Thomas and Cosgrove, form the basis for the current exploration focus.

Empire has published an exploration target of 26–32 billion tonnes at 4.5–5.5% TiO₂, based on only \~20% of the system's mapped footprint . The near-surface saprolite “cap” zone has returned exceptional purity: anatase-rich material with >95% TiO₂, and lab-scale results have produced a >99% TiO₂ concentrate . This is significantly purer than conventional ilmenite mineral sands and could offer downstream processing advantages.

# Financial Position

Empire is a pre-resource explorer with no revenue. It raised roughly £10 million in equity across three placings between early 2024 and mid-2025 . Following the latest raise in May 2025, the company reported a cash balance of \~£7.0 million, with approximately 690 million shares outstanding. The funds are allocated for further drilling, metallurgical testing, and preparation of a maiden JORC resource. The company has a relatively high cash burn, and further dilution is likely over the coming 12–18 months.

# Management and Shareholders

The leadership team is experienced in mining and project development. CEO Shaun Bunn is a metallurgist with prior roles at Hummingbird Resources. Non-executive members include veterans from Lundin, Freeport, and Rio Tinto. Insider ownership is low (<1% per executive), though institutional support is present.

# Strategic Position & Market

Titanium is classified as a critical mineral in the EU, US, and Australia, and WA has supported Pitfield with a drilling grant under its Exploration Incentive Scheme . While no offtake or JV has been signed yet, the company is conducting bulk sample tests to produce high-purity TiO₂ products for potential partners in pigment or aerospace markets .

The combination of massive scale, high purity, and existing infrastructure (road, port, power access nearby) gives Pitfield a potential strategic position in the future titanium supply chain.

# Key Recent Developments

* Warrant Conversion Raises £76.6k On 12 June, Empire announced that 759,988 warrants were exercised at prices between £0.06 and £0.105/share, injecting approximately £76.6k into the treasury. Share count is now 690.4 million, to be admitted to AIM on \~18 June 2025
* 99.25% TiO₂ Product Achieved Lab-scale metallurgical tests on the saprolite cap produced a 99.25% TiO₂ concentrate, reportedly free of deleterious impurities—potentially suitable for both titanium sponge and high-grade pigment markets 
* Drilling Campaign for Maiden JORC Resource Begins On 2 June, Empire launched its largest drilling program yet: 164 holes totaling \~10,700 m to define a maiden JORC-compliant Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) at the high-grade Thomas Prospect, following earlier AC results averaging 6.20% TiO₂ over 54 m from surface 

# Key Catalysts (2025–2026)

* Maiden JORC Resource Estimate – likely within 12 months; formal confirmation of scale and grade is critical
* Expanded Drilling Results – deeper holes and strike extension drilling to support size claims
* Metallurgical Flowsheet Results – scalability of >99% TiO₂ product, recovery rates, impurities
* Bulk Sample Offtake Interest – any agreement with pigment producers, metal refiners or strategic buyers
* Government or Critical Minerals Grants/Backing – increased support from Australia or allied countries
* Uplisting or Index Inclusion – possible inclusion in critical minerals ETFs or UK resource indices
Got into it just around 10p, here for the long run! Lets go! For a stock with the potential of this the traction of it seems very low. I’m in for the long run but not sure why there is so little hype for it Sorry, but what happens with the warrant for more shares, will that bring the price down? Is that dilution? I'm pretty new to investing and don't really understand how that works, I've read it could be a good or bad thing, what's your thoughts? How you feeling? Warrants can cause dilution because they create new shares when exercised, but they also bring fresh cash into the company. In Empire's case, the recent warrant exercise wasn’t massive, so the dilution effect is limited for now. The company raised some capital without taking on debt, which can actually be a positive sign if that money goes into further exploration. As long as the number of outstanding warrants isn't too large, and the growth potential remains strong, it's not necessarily a bad thing. Just something to watch going forward. Good luck, I will add more for sure Thanks for the explanation, I was worried as I'd read a few things where stock had diluted, and the share price plummeted, but I now understand that is based on how many new shares are being issued, so thanks. It was also a concern as this is my first stock that has sky rocketed like that, so I got all edgy thinking i should take some profits 😁. I'd had it on my watch list at 10p, and ended up buying in at 16p after I saw the news of the latest tests. still pretty early i dont even know why it jumped the last days lol

How does this subreddit split up their portfolio between the short(ish) term penny stocks, to the etfs in VOO, SPY, short or long term bonds etc, and the many many other possibilities in larger companies or anything else to possibly invest in. How does you split/manage your profile? 
Roughly 25% Palantir, 20% Penny, 50% Small Cap Growth, 5% OTC. Obviously it’s volatile, but it works well for me. Word of caution it requires constant attention and frequent adjustments. 
Definitely not for the faint of heart.
High risk = High Reward! 1% goes to high risk pennies 90% all world ETF and 10% gambling on pennies. Right now it's 99% all world because I've been gambling on pennies 🤣 30% nvda/amd for the long run and the rest small cap and a couple penny stocks. I also allocate money for crypto. That portion is equal to roughly 5% the value of my total stock portfolio. 50% VOO, 20% SCHG, 30% split between a few penny stocks lol What are some favorite small cap stocks? It's a mix round here bro some will all in on some crap 0.01 cannabis stock some will bag hold a bunch of delisted penny's some will do 5% pennies 95% voo some will do 10% etc some will do 0 voo but a mix of 1-30 dollar stocks like myself with rcat rklb PL mvst all doing very nicely I might add. I'm up like 500% from my investing since last year or more even and I even held through tarriffs and averaged down stayed cool and profited a lot. When I build a solid sum like 30k I'll start like a 75% voo with some solid cheapies to continue the crazy returns. I have no problem sharing my stock portfolio and will say that I try to hold more long term, making moves twice a month (trim losses and reinvest gains/dividends); but have more recently become addicted to OPTIONS in the last year.

I feel if I’m good at choosing stocks at dips and early eras, I can do OPTIONS!

3. June 27 effective inclusion date to Russell 2000 & 3000 Indexes 

  
Not a bullshit company, you won't get caught holding a bag. There products are starting to show up in Home Depot. And as someone who owns a construction co. (sheet Metal in Los Angeles), their Smart Plug & Play system is quite ingenious .

Basically ceilings fans, bluetooth speakers, lighting fixtures , anything within that realm basically you can change and swap out within seconds . Like a universal Outlet if you will 

[https://www.skyxplatforms.com](https://www.skyxplatforms.com)

Also they are planning on introducing this tech to Building & Safety Code , not sure State or Federal level . but that is still years away I believe , but a Potential GodMode Cataylst for those who wish to hold long . On this end please do more research , and I would like to hear your thoughts on it . If im not mistaken they have already introduced an update to some Building Code, but nothing major. 

You can swing play this, play it long , or do both like me.  Momentum and volume should start trickling in beginning of next week. 


Everyone let’s agree to sell all our Kulr and buy this shit instead. Like if you will Nice. Finally a DD that’s not generated by AI! Thanks for sharing Interesting. Indeed looks like if nothing happens just sell with a 10 procent loss end of june. Dont see major risk, gonne wait out the trump parade first tho Just wondering because I was going through old threads for SKYX talking about many catalysts that didn’t really amount to much movement. How is this different? Not hating just curious to what you see here. ![gif](giphy|s4RC4Wo3BPzEw2oVPX) It's exactly why im going in so Heavy . Ive studied the Charts in correlation to times of the News & Contracts dropped. It has not gone up at all , if anything slowly bled out.

The Market moves to its own tune. Not Ours

This play is about as risk averse as it gets in Penny land imo . No pharma, no biotech, no china BS , never been manipulated from what I can tell , pump & dump or whatever. 

It's either gonna take off or be stagnant . That's a ride im willing to take . but DYOR , and at the very least put it on your sniper list , monitor its movements $SKYX, it is nice to see someone with industry experience recognize the product. To fill in a couple of blanks. They have had ten additions to the NEC national electric code ... They have filed for a mandate specifically on the basis of safety. Every year, people are injured, and loss of life occurs from miswirevings, house fires, and ladder falls from trying to hardwire a light fixture or ceiling fan into the ceiling. The SKYX Platform enables most of the wiring to be done on the ground. Not up on a ladder for anywhere between 30 minutes if you know what you are doing to 2 hours if you don't. The WSCR weight supporting ceiling receptacle takes around 3 to 4 minutes to install in the junction box. Three color coded holes for the wires to insert to. 2 screws to install it into the junction box slap on the cover plate, and that portion is done. Take the Sky plug and install it on your fixture on the ground. Once installed, climb the ladder pushing in a button on the side of the sky plug, insert it into the hole in the receptacle, let the button go, and you are done. If you want to switch out a fixture, you can do it in seconds once the wscr is installed. The mistake Wall Street is making is they look at SKYX as a hardware play. If that is all this company was, I would not be in it. Tell me another lighting or ceiling fan company that has  subscription services for recurring revenue after the sale? Has licensing opportunities for any company that wants their brand at the center of every room at the highest point in the room. There is much more to consider. The news of the smart city is meaningful it is a snapshot as to how massive the industry is. 500OOO units on one project. Here is why the street did not react. The job has not broken ground. Light fixtures and ceiling fans are one of the last items to be installed. That means that revenue is probably 2 or 3 years out. What it does is show you have a world-renowned architect using it on the entire project. What would you think if you had a project ready for lighting right now? Would it be worth a phone call or a web search to find out more about the product? There is so much more to dig into, but I don't want to bore people. Great write-up, and I believe you are on the right path. I am very bullish on the long-term outlook. SHEEEEEEESHHHHHH

1lat642,2025-06-13,"$HOTH Due Diligence and potential uptrend.
Hoth Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotech firm focused on creating innovative treatments for conditions with significant unmet medical needs.

The company’s pipeline includes HT-001, a topical drug currently in Phase II trials aimed at managing skin rashes and disorders caused by first-line and subsequent tyrosine kinase epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor therapies. Other candidates include HT-KIT for mast-cell cancers and severe allergic reactions, HT-TBI for brain injuries and strokes, HT-ALZ targeting Alzheimer’s disease and other neuroinflammatory conditions, HT-004 for asthma and allergy relief via inhalation, and HT-003, being explored for acne, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel diseases.

Additionally, Hoth is advancing its BioLexa Platform, a patented treatment in early trials for eczema, and HT-005 for lupus patients.

The company maintains licensing partnerships with George Washington University, Virginia Commonwealth University, North Carolina State University, Isoprene Pharmaceuticals, Chelexa BioSciences, University of Cincinnati, Zylö Therapeutics, and Voltron Therapeutics. It also collaborates with Weill Cornell Medicine on HT-003.

Founded in 2017, Hoth Therapeutics is based in New York City.



HT-001 Expanded Access for Cancer Patients

In March 2025, Hoth revealed its plan to submit an Expanded Access application for HT-001, offering cancer patients a potential treatment for skin issues tied to their therapy. This positive development continued to make headlines into June.

HT-001 is designed to ease skin side effects linked to EGFR inhibitor cancer treatments. With encouraging trial data so far, Hoth hopes to provide this option outside traditional trials through its compassionate use program.

“Pursuing this application reflects our mission to make HT-001 accessible to those who could benefit,” said Robb Knie, Hoth’s CEO. “We are focused on addressing urgent medical needs and improving life quality for cancer patients.”

The Expanded Access Program aims to help patients facing severe illnesses who lack other treatment alternatives. Through this pathway, Hoth plans to provide HT-001 to eligible patients while continuing to monitor its safety and performance.



Promising HT-001 Results in EGFR Inhibitor-Related Skin Conditions

At the 2025 American Academy of Dermatology meeting (March 7-11), Hoth shared promising findings on HT-001’s use for EGFR inhibitor-related skin issues.

A highlighted case featured a 59-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer treated with paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab, who developed painful red papules on her face, scalp, and upper back. After applying HT-001 2% cream twice daily for a week, her symptoms fully cleared and didn’t return for at least three weeks.

“These results point to HT-001’s potential as a safe, effective solution for these difficult skin toxicities,” said Knie. “There’s a real need for durable and well-tolerated treatments in this space.”

HT-001 targets the Substance P (SP)-NK1R pathway, a key driver of neurogenic inflammation. Early studies suggest the drug reduces inflammation and hair loss linked to EGFR therapies. The latest clinical data support its potential role in cancer-related dermatology.



Encouraging GDNF Data for Obesity Treatment

In early June, Hoth announced preclinical research showing Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (GDNF) could revolutionize obesity therapy. Tests on GDNF-transgenic models found GDNF curbed fat build-up, boosted metabolism, and improved insulin sensitivity—even on a high-fat diet.

“This data strengthens GDNF’s promise as a novel obesity solution,” Knie said. “Unlike common treatments that curb appetite or limit calories, GDNF works by naturally enhancing fat metabolism and energy use.”

Key findings included:
	•	Resistance to diet-induced obesity: GDNF-tg mice maintained lower weight and body fat despite high-fat diets.
	•	Boosted metabolism: GDNF elevated energy use without reducing food intake.
	•	Blocked fat cell formation: It downregulated fat storage genes while activating fat-burning pathways.
	•	Better insulin response: GDNF-tg mice showed superior glucose handling and lower leptin levels.
	•	Protection against fatty liver: GDNF prevented liver fat buildup, often seen with obesity.

Given obesity’s massive global impact and the limits of current drugs, GDNF could represent a new approach by addressing metabolic function rather than focusing solely on appetite.



Leadership

Robb Knie, CEO, has led the company since 2017. His experience spans over two decades in equity markets and leadership roles at several public companies. He has appeared in major media outlets and is active in professional organizations including the American Chemical Society and IEEE.



Outlook

Hoth boasts a robust pipeline, a consensus analyst target of $4.75 (high of $7.00), no debt, and around $10 million in cash. The company has no plans for dilution at this time.

Recent news flow, including a partnership with Veterans Affairs, has kept Hoth on investor radars. Any additional positive updates or increased trading volume could drive the stock significantly higher. A key opinion leader presentation on June 24th could further fuel interest in its cancer-focused topical therapy.

It's no longer a tale, it's purrrfect!

Amidst the war, good things happen elsewhere, the crypto shocks of recent hours, haven't stop the leading singaporean waste management company to seal the merging deal with De Tomaso, the super car brand. 

  
Price surged from $2 to $3 in less than a month and still pushing hard. Wondering when is the next stop!

Ik for a fact; merging with De Tomaso instantly elevates ESGL’s brand equity by adding a high-margin, aspirational consumer segment to its portfolio. This is not a speculative play, it’s a transition into a tangible asset market with established customer demand and pricing power.

Maybe the time to add more before Ndq listing ? can't be any better!

1laet3l,2025-06-13,"NexGen Announces Regulatory Approval of 2025 Site Program at Rook I Property
* **2025 Program includes a temporary exploration airstrip, expansion of exploration camp facilities and site access road improvements.**
* **Patterson Corridor East (""PCE"") discovery is expanding rapidly and the 2025 Program will optimize this growth.**

https://preview.redd.it/a79i6m2nvo6f1.jpg?width=200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e2f4a4850e9de51911aea5811a4498d2a605b4c7

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - June 12, 2025) - **NexGen Energy Ltd.  (TSX: NXE) (NYSE: NXE) (ASX: NXG) (""NexGen"" or the ""Company"")** is pleased to announce that the Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment has granted approval for NexGen's 2025 Site Program (the ""Program"") at its 100%-owned Rook I Property in the Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan. The Program includes the establishment of a temporary exploration airstrip, expansion of the exploration accommodation camp facilities by 373 beds and site access road improvements.

The Program will commence in the coming weeks and conclude with camp commissioning in Q1 2026. This program builds on NexGen's disciplined, strategic approach to implementing infrastructure enhancements required to support the Company's exploration programs at PCE and that forecast across NexGen's dominant land package in northwestern Saskatchewan into the future.

The drill results of high-grade basement hosted mineralization discovered at PCE 3.5km east from the Arrow deposit indicate another significant scale zone ""Arrow style"" of mineralization is materializing and warrant these infrastructure enhancements incorporating best practice safety and environmental principles.

Incorporating NexGen's longstanding approach to economic capacity building, the Program will prioritize Local Priority Area participation, generating new employment and contracting opportunities for Indigenous and community members, reflecting NexGen's industry leading and genuine approach to local communities.

**Leigh Curyer, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, commented:** ""The 2025 Site Program marks an exciting strategic milestone for our current and future activities, with key infrastructure improvements that will optimize safety, environmental protection, and efficiency for our people and our programs. These infrastructure enhancements create the conditions for a high-performing operational platform capable of fully evaluating the significant resource potential across our Rook I Property. This Program is a direct reflection of NexGen's proactive approach to responsible resource development, elite planning and demonstrates our continued commitment to building lasting value while creating meaningful opportunities for local Indigenous and community members.""

**The Honourable Premier of Saskatchewan Scott Moe, commented:** \*""\*I congratulate and thank NexGen for their major investment in Saskatchewan to date. The Rook I Project is one of the most significant projects across the country and we are keen to see it prioritized by the Government of Canada accordingly. Our government is proud to approve these infrastructure activities which are well within our jurisdiction and that are scheduled to commence imminently. NexGen is an example of strategically delivering a generational opportunity for Saskatchewan to become the world's leader in the mining of uranium, and I look forward to working with newly elected Prime Minister Mark Carney to expedite the final Federal approval of this generational opportunity for Saskatchewan and Canada.""

**2025 Site Program Overview**

Temporary Exploration Airstrip

* Establishment of a gravel exploration airstrip (<1,000m) on the Rook I Property to enhance health and safety of workers and accommodate an increase in the regional exploration program, augmenting emergency response capabilities and human and environmental protection through the reduction of vehicular transportation of personnel to site.

Expansion of Temporary Exploration Camp Facilities

* Engineering, procurement, and installation of hard-walled modular facilities to accommodate 373 additional beds, ensuring the site can house and service the expanded technical teams and specialized personnel as exploration activities intensify.

Site Access Improvements

* Improvements to the 13 km Rook I access road to enhance overall worker and equipment safety, including widening the road surface to allow for safe, two-way traffic flow.
* Enhanced road base construction to support increased frequency of supply deliveries and specialized exploration equipment.

NexGen has the most significant land position in Saskatchewan's southwest Athabasca Basin, where it holds over 190,000 hectares. From an exploration perspective, the Company is currently focused on the continued material growth of mineralization at PCE - located just 3.5 km east of the world-class Arrow Deposit. Planning is already underway for potential future programs at PCE as the balance of the 2025 drilling program is preparing to recommence in June.

**About NexGen**

1la4gv1,2025-06-13,"$SGN we got around a 600% move. $GLMD can be our next parabolic mover
If you saw my other post on $GLMD, you will see why I’m beyond bullish here. The daily chart is setting up beautifully as we get closer to some upcoming catalyst. We were told in April that we would get more info within 90 days on their licensing agreement for the development and commercialization of a proprietary Self-Emulsifying Drug Delivery System (SEDDS) formulation that allows absorption of sublingually administrated peptides such as GLP-1 (Semaglutide, Liraglutide etc.). Most don’t understand the potential here so let me break it down. Imagine an ozempic weight loss shot without the shot. Yes no injection and would be as simple as a dissolvable under the tongue. This could take over the entire weight loss market if they don’t get bought out. And the company is only at around a $7m market cap? 🤯 throw in Aramchol and its multi billion dollar expansion potential beyond NASH. Even if this company 100x from here. It’s still only sitting at a $700m market cap. The potential is huge here for this heavily shorted 4m float bio company. We saw this squeeze well over $20 one already not too long ago. I think we can see it happen again soon
5 employees? Situated in Israel, who just attacked Iran? mmmmmmmm no SSY and SGMA were other great calls. GLMD looks good. No one brought religion into it, well except you. 

And it most likely will be affected, at least optically Yeah I'll sit this one out. How can you rely on a company who has 3 employees? Thanks for sharing.

Btw what happened to sgn? It looks delisted Not delisted. We got the PR we were waiting for that they signed the agreement and it flew big. The PR stated the deal is set to close the second half of the year. Most locked profits and hype disappeared. I’m patiently waiting for the right entry price tho to add again and swing into the closing of the deal. I’m gonna check it out.  Thanks for the dive.  Sounds like  probably a great short rip and take profits and then stick around for long term.   I have trouble setting exit strategies but sounds like it broke 21 recently? i'm glad you are sitting this one out, already up from 1.5 to 1.77$. I love when people whine and price go up. This is a pump and dump by the gang that pumped another Israel company, RVSN. t They front loaded already.

1l9w15a,2025-06-12,"Anyone Watching CPS Technologies (CPSH)?
CPS Technologies (CPSH) has been drawing some attention recently. The company specializes in metal matrix composites (MMCs), which are used for thermal management and structural applications, particularly in the defense, aerospace, and energy sectors. These materials offer high strength and lightweight properties, making them valuable in environments with extreme heat or mechanical stress.

With a market cap around $30 million and a float of approximately 12 million shares, CPSH is a low-float micro-cap that has shown volatility in the past. Recent earnings reports suggest an increase in backlog, which may indicate stronger revenue visibility in upcoming quarters. However, fundamental concerns remain around profitability, customer concentration, and long-term growth sustainability.

Technically, the stock is trading near support levels, with occasional spikes in volume. It’s unclear whether this is the beginning of a trend reversal or just another short-term bounce. Given the low float and occasional interest from retail traders, some are watching for potential breakout setups or even short squeeze dynamics.

The company’s exposure to defense spending and infrastructure investment could offer thematic upside, but opinions vary on whether the underlying fundamentals justify current or future valuations.

If anyone has done recent technical or fundamental analysis on CPSH, it would be great to hear your take. Also interested in any updated info on short interest, institutional ownership (13F filings), or catalysts worth tracking in the near term.
I have a small amount of shares in it.  CPSH and MVST are actually the only penny stocks I have that I’m positive in.  Most of the time I’m stuck bag holding in the red. CPSH looks interesting.  I wish I knew more about their business.  Especially the technology involved and their competitive edge, if any, in the markets they serve.

Many of the penny stocks people buy are at best lottery tickets.  This may have potential. Snagged 50 shares when they ran recently because for a $2.67 stock they did $7.5M in sales last quarter up from $5.91M YoY.  If anyone knows anything about penny stocks and actually working for a smaller company, that kind of sales increase should be commended. A whole lot of pennystocks here get promoted or pumped and have revenue in the hundreds of thousands, we should all take notice when a pennystock is actually profitable and running a responsible business. 

As I always like to remind people, $NVDA was a novel “GPU” company a decade ago with a stock price that couldn’t get above $3. 

We should all take notice.

1l9093p,2025-06-11,"$VRA – Dead Brand or Deep Value Sleeper?
Vera Bradley ($VRA) just tanked to all-time lows after missing earnings again. Revenue dropped ~10% YoY, mostly due to a failed attempt at rebranding and underperformance from their Pura Vida segment. But here's why this might be more opportunity than obituary:


---

🔹 $50M Market Cap / No Debt / 50% Insider-Owned

Clean balance sheet: ~$30M in cash, zero debt

Insiders (including founders) still hold ~50% of shares

Trading at ~0.1x revenue, ~0.5x book, and close to net-net territory



---

🔹 Long-Term Stability, Short-Term Pain

Revenue held steady around $450M for 10+ years

FY2024 finally saw a dip, mostly due to poor Pura Vida performance

Core Vera Bradley brand still profitable, just in need of a direction



---

🔹 New Blood: Ex-Supreme + Coach Execs

New CFO: Martin Layding, previously CFO at Coach and for Supreme during its Carlyle era

New Executive Chairman: Ian Bickley, ex-global president of Coach

They're forming a ""Transformation Committee"" to explore strategic pivots or value unlocks



---

🔹 Brand Might Be Hitting 'Retro' Status
Vera’s peak was ~2007–2012, but younger buyers are starting to embrace early-2000s aesthetics again (think Juicy Couture/Coach comebacks). A throwback angle could work here, especially with a seasoned brand team.


---

Bottom Line:
You're getting a no-debt, cash-rich company with long-term retail infrastructure and trademark value, trading for less than inventory. If the new team can stabilize or relaunch the brand (think Classic Coke-style pivot), there’s serious upside. If not? Still not the worst risk/reward at these levels.


---

Not a pump, not a buy rec—just a broken stock with optionality. Curious if anyone else is watching.

Source?  Or just saying that because it happens a lot?  The new leadership has a history of increasing value for investors. It's still 50% insider owned and as far as I can tell the private equity firms involved have a decent track record.

Oncolytics Biotech® Names New CEO to Accelerate Momentum in Immunotherapy Programs
Jun 11, 2025, 07:00 ET
SAN DIEGO and CALGARY, AB, June 11, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — Oncolytics Biotech® Inc. (NASDAQ: ONCY) (TSX: ONC), a leading clinical-stage company specializing in immunotherapy for oncology, today announced the appointment of Jared Kelly as Chief Executive Officer and a member of its Board of Directors.

Mr. Kelly is a successful biotech executive who has proven expertise in transformative deals and corporate strategy. Most recently, he played a central role in orchestrating the sale of Ambrx Biopharma to Johnson & Johnson for $2 billion. Prior to Ambrx, he advised multiple leading-edge biotech companies on M&A and licensing transactions at highly respected law firms, including Lowenstein Sandler LLP and Kirkland & Ellis LLP. He is a JD and LLM graduate of Georgetown Law.

“Mr. Kelly’s vision and track record is an extraordinary fit with the standout clinical data pelareorep has generated to date,” said Wayne Pisano, Chair of Oncolytics’ Board of Directors and outgoing Interim CEO. “We believe Mr. Kelly’s well-documented ability to prioritize clinical program development, execute successful financings, and attract the attention of large industry peers will help maximize Oncolytics’ potential to deliver transformative outcomes for patients and exceptional value for investors.”

Mr. Kelly added, “Pelareorep’s clinical data across multiple tumors is striking and represents the potential for a true backbone immunotherapy to address many in-need indications. Importantly, the data show that pelareorep creates a robust immunologic response in difficult tumors and increases survival in a patient population where survival has historically evaded most patients. With a renewed focus and sharpened clinical development plan, we believe we will move pelareorep forward effectively and efficiently to a place where potential partners will see the value of a de-risked immunotherapy. I am excited to get to work accelerating development and unlocking significant value for stakeholders.”

Pelareorep, an intravenously-administered immunotherapeutic agent, has been granted FDA Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC) and HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer (mBC). It has delivered compelling results in mPDAC, a high-value indication with significant unmet need. In Phase 1 and 2 trials involving more than 140 mPDAC patients, pelareorep has delivered a >60% objective response rate in tumor evaluable patients in the most recent study, which is more than double the benefit observed in historical control trials, and, separately, two-year survival rates 4-6 times those observed in control patients or against the benchmark in prior studies.

In mBC, pelareorep recorded a meaningful survival benefit in two randomized Phase 2 studies of over 100 combined mBC patients, IND-213 and BRACELET-1. Phase 2 objective response rate data in second-line or later unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCA) patients continue to exceed historical data for treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor alone. These consistent efficacy signals, in combination with multiple chemotherapies and checkpoint inhibitors, uniquely position pelareorep as a high-potential asset for further development in-house and/or through strategic partnerships. Pelareorep also has a well-defined and favorable safety profile based on data from >1,100 patients across multiple tumor types.

As a material inducement to Mr. Kelly’s appointment as Chief Executive Officer, and in accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(c)(4), Mr. Kelly has been awarded an initial stock option grant exercisable for 2,850,000 shares with an exercise price of CAD$0.57, vesting equally over three years. He also received a performance-based stock option grant exercisable for 1,900,000 shares with an exercise price of CAD$0.57, which will vest upon the achievement of certain financing objectives. All stock option grants have a term of 5 years from the date of grant. The Company also granted Mr. Kelly restricted stock units, which will entitle him to receive that number of Common Shares equal to 2% of the Company’s then outstanding common shares upon the Company entering into a definitive agreement for certain transactions providing for the acquisition of the Company or the exclusive license of pelareorep. Each of these awards is intended to align Mr. Kelly’s long-term incentives with the creation of shareholder value.
With the way things are going that's more than possible. It went up 34% today. They've got till 10th Aug to have 10 consecutive trading days over $1 to avoid delisting In @.74 on 1,500 shares  Totally agree

# 🚀 URGN – FDA Lotto Ticket for Bladder Tendies 🍑💉 (June 13 Is Judgement Day)

Listen up you beautiful smooth-brained degenerates. We’ve got ourselves a spicy biotech play with **URGN** (UroGen Pharma), currently sitting at \~$7, waiting for the FDA gods to either rain golden lentils from the heavens or send us back to goblin mode eating ramen in the dark.

This is **not** a drill. This is a **binary event moonshot** with real potential. You either hodl and ride this thing **to the moon**, or you sit on the sidelines and miss the squeeze of the summer.

# 💸 The Fundamentals – Not Just Vaporware, Bros

* Market cap: $320M (tiny rocket, easy to send orbital)
* Cash in the bank: **$200M+** (aka **$4.30/share in pure lentils**)
* Revenue: They actually sell a drug (**Jelmyto** for kidney cancer) bringing in \~$20M/quarter. This ain’t a pre-revenue fantasy pump.
* Debt: **ZERO**. They owe nobody. Kings move in silence and so does URGN.
* Burn rate covered for **at least 2 years**, even if FDA says no. There's a **cash floor**, boys. You’re not catching a falling knife, you’re catching a knife made of **money**.

Worst case? It drops a couple bucks and chills on its cash pile. Best case? FDA hits us with that sweet, sweet **“approved”** and this thing rips like GME circa Jan 2021.

# ⚡ THE CATALYST – June 13, Baby

FDA verdict incoming for **UGN-102**, a non-surgical bladder cancer treatment. This stuff **actually works** (solid Phase III data), but the FDA panel in May voted 4-5 **against** approval – not a rug, just a spicy coin toss.

**Why we care:**

* If FDA ignores the panel (happens more often than you think), URGN goes **supersonic**.
* Market for this drug? **Huge**. Bladder cancer is common and this would help thousands avoid surgery.
* If denied? Stock might dip, but we still got Jelmyto pumping lentils and **$200M in the war chest**.

It’s the **perfect asymmetric setup**. Heads = 🚀, Tails = soft landing with snacks.

# 🧨 Market Structure – The Squeeze Is Real

* Float? **Tiny.**
* Short interest? **25%+**. Absolute fuel.
* Average volume? Not much. A news pop would force **shorts to cover in low liquidity**. That’s how you get face-melters.
* Options market? Apes loading up on calls. Somebody’s betting big on green candles.

Shorts been piling on since the panel vote. That means if FDA shocks the street with an approval, we’re gonna see **a panic scramble for shares**. And at $7, this thing is basically selling at **cash value**. No one’s paper-handing it under that.

# 📈 Passive Flow + Buy Zones

URGN is already in the Russell 2000, so no surprise inclusions coming, but it’s **not getting booted** either. If it moons, index funds might have to **buy more** just to rebalance. And if it tanks? Some value chads or an acquirer could swoop in for the tech + cash.

As for timing?

* YOLO apes = Buy now, **pre-FDA**, aim for max tendie explosion.
* Conservative chimps = Wait for FDA, chase the breakout or buy the dip post-denial.
* Risk/reward math? Downside to $4–$5 max. Upside? **$15+ easy**. That's **2–3x on base case**, 5x if we go full rocket.

Current zone ($6–$8) is straight-up **accumulation alley**. You’re buying a biotech stonk with a moon-ticket for less than the cash in its pockets.

# 💎 Final Verdict: This Is Asymmetric Ape Heaven

If you’re looking for that **once-a-summer binary gamble** where the **lentils are juicy** and the downside is soft, **URGN is it**.

✅ Biotech? Check.  
✅ FDA catalyst? Check.  
✅ High short interest? Check.  
✅ Mega upside with a cash cushion? Check.  
✅ Insiders not selling? Check.  
✅ Apes about to YOLO in? You bet your hairy cheeks.

So do your own DD, don’t overbet your rent money, but this is the kind of **lotto ticket with an actual backstop** that makes penny stock degeneracy fun again.

**Positions:** Not financial advice. But I'm hodling this thing till either the FDA says yes or I’m eating government cheese.

**FDA Moon Date: JUNE 13** – mark it, ape it, ride it. 🦍🚀🌕
Looks like FDA just approved URGN’s Zusduri What are your thoughts on the lawsuit? A class action lawsuit against Urg Gen Pharm limited that seeks to recover shareholder who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between July 27, 2023 and May 15, 2025?  Also where are you seeing June 13 date for FDA approval? How cam they have no debt, when they report red ledgers aka more spending than earning.

1l86tyf,2025-06-10,"Three Canadian Penny Stocks I'm Watching This Month
**RIPP.CN, NBY.V, FRG.CN**

What’s up everyone, wanted to throw a few small caps on your radar that I’ve been following pretty closely this month. Each one is totally different in sector and setup, but all three have something interesting going on. These are speculative, obviously, but that’s kind of the point, I like hunting stories that are just getting started and haven’t hit the mainstream flow yet.

**1. Digital Commodities Capital ($RIPP.CN)**

This one’s flying almost completely under the radar, which is exactly why it caught my attention. RIPP is essentially a holding company targeting blockchain and digital asset investments, think early stage venture style, not a layer 1 chain or protocol token. They’ve got no product per se, but they’re positioning themselves as a consolidator of sorts in digital assets. It’s a model we’ve seen before, sometimes it flops, but sometimes it hits real scale if the market comes back and they make a few smart early moves.

Recently, the stock has been showing life. It’s up over 80% in the past week alone and just crossed the $0.07 mark. That might not sound like much, but with a tiny float and sub-$10M market cap, that kind of volume tells you something is happening. If they announce any acquisitions, even small ones, or start positioning themselves as a proxy play for blockchain in Canada, this could become a fast moving retail trade. For now, it's mostly a momentum setup, but I’ll be watching to see if there’s any real substance behind the move. Definitely not one to bet the house on, but sometimes these microcaps get hot before the news even hits.

**2. Niobay Metals ($NBY.V)**

This one just got a lot more interesting. Niobay literally just kicked off its 2025 drill program at the Crevier project in Quebec. For those not familiar, Crevier is a niobium and tantalum project, two metals that don’t get as much retail attention as lithium or uranium, but are absolutely critical for aerospace, electronics, and EVs. What makes this setup compelling is that Crevier is one of the few North American niobium-tantalum assets with real size and potential.

Niobay is starting with a 1,000 metre drill campaign across 6-8 holes, mostly infill and step outs to tighten up the geological model and potentially extend the mineralization. They’ve already got historic data on this thing, and the drill program is aimed at de-risking it even further. It’s still early days, no flashy assays yet, but this kind of project fits perfectly into the current macro narrative around securing domestic supply chains for critical minerals. They also received provincial support in the form of a \~$400K grant, which helps signal government interest. I think if even a few drill holes come back strong, this could re-rate quickly. Right now it’s still sitting sub $0.10, which is wild considering the jurisdiction and how strategic this asset could be.

**3. Forge Resources ($FRG.CN)**

Forge is probably the most developed name on this list, and also the one with the most meat on the bones operationally. They’re working two angles: a fully permitted coal project in Colombia called La Estrella, and an early stage porphyry copper-gold target up in the Yukon. The Colombia side is interesting because they’ve been quietly consolidating ownership ,they now own 80% of La Estrella after a recent deal, and seem to be setting up for bulk sampling or even near term production. Say what you want about coal, but there’s still global demand, especially for high grade product, and it generates cash. This is a make money project.

Then there’s the Yukon angle. They’ve just started drilling last week and seem confident enough in the porphyry potential to push forward aggressively this summer. It’s early stage exploration, so you’ve got the usual discovery risk, but if they hit anything remotely economic, it adds a whole other layer of upside. Combine that with their relatively tight structure, some recent institutional participation, and decent market volume, and this becomes one of those “quietly building” stories that could start gaining more attention by Q3.

Each of these companies is at a different stage, RIPP is more of a speculation on narrative, NBY is a thematic play on critical minerals with drilling just getting started, and FRG is a hybrid story with real assets and a bit of cash flow optionality. I like keeping a few of these on watch at all times. If the market starts rewarding juniors again, these types of setups usually move first.

If you’re tracking anything else this month, especially in mining or small cap energy, drop them in the comments. I’m always looking for new under the radar plays. As always, not financial advice, just sharing what’s on my screen.

1l80q10,2025-06-10,"I know sports betting but feel like a caveman on the stock market
What’s up degens!

Probably gonna drop this in a few subs, so dont be surprised if its crossposted. 

So, like a lot of people here, I’m completely new to investing. I’m 24 and embarrassed to admit I know *nothing* about stocks, options, ETFs, or whatever wizardry y’all are out here doing. I open Reddit or YouTube, and it’s like everyone’s speaking a different language. Stop limits, puts, dividends, inverse ETFs — I am a photographer, like what?

I’ve done *decent* with sports betting, so I figured, “Hey, how hard can this be?” Then the stock market hit me with a glossary the size of the Bible.

I’m one of those “spoiled kids” that everyone in these groups shits on, who grew up pretty fortunate, but still doesn’t know anything about money. At least I can admit it though lol, and I am trying to learn. My parents set me up with a Roth IRA and some mutual funds, I think, but I don’t have access to any of that stuff and honestly don’t want to mess with it. My parents are very smart, successful people, and I trust that they are setting me up for success. It’s just quietly growing in the background while I try to figure out what the hell I’m doing here.

Right now, I’m operating on a shoestring budget — think Dollar Menu investor. You will not catch me dropping $1,000 into anything. I’m playing with like $10 to $75 at a time on Robinhood while working from home. I’ve only put in about $35 total across SPY, NVDA, AFRM, GOOGL, and NGS. Everything’s green, but I’m literally up like 12 cents lmaooo. Ballin’ on a budget.

I’ve tried messing around with Investopedia’s simulator, but that fake money makes me way too confident. Dropping $100K on something with no consequences? Yeah, real life ain’t like that, at least for me.

My goal is to learn the basics, mess around with small amounts, and maybe try some short-term plays while still keeping some money in safer, long-term positions. Youtube has honestly confused me more, and I just need some guidance. Please take out your crystal ball and tell me what to do. I work remotely so I can stare at candlestick charts while pretending to work — just need to figure out what the hell I’m even looking at.

So yeah — I’m here, broke, confused, but ready to learn. If you’ve got any tips for someone starting with pennies and vibes, drop them below. Appreciate y’all.

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)* Being fortunate monetarily has a cost and sometimes it your family. Well you’re in the right spot. Pennystocks are straight gambling, not investing This is super helpful thank you! The firstt thing I did was take 75% of the money and put it on SPY, then I spread the rest out between AFRM, NVDA, GOOGL and its doing well, but obviously its a tiny tiny tiny amount of money/profit, very low risk. I would like to play around more with penny stocks though and try an and gamble a bit lmao. they and you don't have time to get together?, broo I’m feeling you on the trial by fire approach. It’s kinda how I learned to hustle through my photog gigs too. Didn’t touch any fancy stuff or get formal classes, just jumped into projects, botched them, then picked up tips from the pros around me. Ever tried Skillshare or Udemy? They got quick and dirty courses that saved me when YouTube felt like white noise. Also, tools like Pulse for Reddit can help filter through the noise on social media, kinda like getting the right feedback without the fluff. Keep grinding and trust your gut, man. Honestly, if you have a job, you could start investing $100 every week into a growth fund or any premium growth stocks you find with research. You're still young so you could risk investing in growth (not financial advice). $35 is really nothing to work with unless you're trying to do some sort of trading challenge. 

But some stocks I could recommend you to do research into are NBIS, LUNR, ABCL, ADMA, MVST, DNN, MBOT. 

Also, don't assume that the lower price the stock is the better chance you have to make money. You can ask AI to help you research into industries, especially hyped ones, if you want, make sure to tell it to take into account current economic/political stuff and use both financial and technical analysis. It won't be 100% accurate of course and you should do your own due diligence. You have a long way to go, at least learn the basics of financials for valuation and technicals for the right time to buy. Asking for advice here is tricky since there’s some folks here just looking to take advantage of others. My advice would be to educate yourself. There’s plenty of free books available that explain the basics. This is definitely a resource to learn as well, just filter what you read here. Keep it simple- DCA with the S&P500, with a small amount of side money for messing about with/ or to learn with.",4,0.56,45,0,ksunk8,pennystocks,"['NVDA', 'SPY', 'GOOGL']",know sports betting feel like caveman stock market whats degens probably gonna drop subs dont surprised crossposted like lot people im completely new investing im 24 embarrassed admit know nothing stocks options etfs whatever wizardry yall open reddit youtube like everyones speaking different language stop limits puts dividends inverse etfs photographer like ive done decent sports betting figured hey hard stock market hit glossary size bible im one spoiled kids everyone groups shits grew pretty fortunate still doesnt know anything money least admit though lol trying learn parents set roth ira mutual funds think dont access stuff honestly dont want mess parents smart successful people trust setting success quietly growing background try figure hell im right im operating shoestring budget think dollar menu investor catch dropping 1000 anything im playing like 10 75 time robinhood working home ive put 35 total across spy nvda afrm googl ngs everythings green im literally like 12 cents lmaooo ballin budget ive tried messing around investopedias simulator fake money makes way confident dropping 100k something consequences yeah real life aint like least goal learn basics mess around small amounts maybe try shortterm plays still keeping money safer longterm positions youtube honestly confused need guidance please take crystal ball tell work remotely stare candlestick charts pretending work need figure hell im even looking yeah im broke confused ready learn youve got tips someone starting pennies vibes drop appreciate yall reread paragraph wrote parents think asking advice sleep plant reminiscent gaze obtainable ask marry payment sable tap post mass deleted anonymized redact fortunate monetarily cost sometimes family well youre right spot pennystocks straight gambling investing super helpful thank firstt thing take 75 money put spy spread rest afrm nvda googl well obviously tiny tiny tiny amount moneyprofit low risk would like play around penny stocks though try gamble bit lmao dont time get together broo im feeling trial fire approach kinda learned hustle photog gigs didnt touch fancy stuff get formal classes jumped projects botched picked tips pros around ever tried skillshare udemy got quick dirty courses saved youtube felt like white noise also tools like pulse reddit help filter noise social media kinda like getting right feedback without fluff keep grinding trust gut man honestly job could start investing 100 every week growth fund premium growth stocks find research youre still young could risk investing growth financial advice 35 really nothing work unless youre trying sort trading challenge stocks could recommend research nbis lunr abcl adma mvst dnn mbot also dont assume lower price stock better chance make money ask ai help research industries especially hyped ones want make sure tell take account current economicpolitical stuff use financial technical analysis wont 100 accurate course due diligence long way go least learn basics financials valuation technicals right time buy asking advice tricky since theres folks looking take advantage others advice would educate theres plenty free books available explain basics definitely resource learn well filter read keep simple dca sp500 small amount side money messing learn

Your username is the stock ticker? What's with you two having the ticker as a part of your usernames?

I don't even hate the stock, but this is wild shit lol Makes me think it’s just the same guy trying to pump the stock Just looked at this clunker yesterday. All talk no results, no data to prove the method works better than smelting. 

And on top of that they do business with the biggest crooks on wall street, only concerned with their commissions and providing exit liquidity to the top Dawgs. 

If ya don't believe me look up Aegis capital. There's a few lawyers that cover all their shenanigans. My favorite factoid about Aegis is 94% of the stocks they deal out go to near zero. 

I think these two ticker user name dorks are interns at Aegis who drum up hype for the exit liquidity pump. Best to either stay away from any ticker associated with Aegis or buy and chalk up your stops every day. They'll pump but there will be a violent and sudden rug pull. 

Last thing look at aqms 10k, over 11mil for admin costs and 1mil for r&d. Zero proof that their process works better. Stock dilution everywhere, likely more once they get a pump outta the fools. Dang, seems like this one dude has 4 accounts dedicated to pumping this stock. One of them is even a mod at r/LQMT Yes, I added that LQMT to my screen name as it was the only reason I joined Reddit at the time. To be clear, I am not a trader, a pumper, or fanboy. I have been working in global advanced manufacturing R&D for decades in 36 countries, written two books, and a long term investor. This company had been around for a long time bringing this innovative material to commercialization. It takes a long time to disrupt an industry, but many of us believe it is a game changer and the time has come. Apple has been involved with the company and is reported by Ming to be using it in the upcoming iPhone Fold. The SIM ejector tool that accompanied older iPhones is made from LiquidMetal. The new Evie ring by Movano uses LiquidMetal. They are “currently prototyping a premium credit card product for first tier US based financial institution utilizing lqmt unique alloy to create beautiful thin cards to be used for their premium cc line” (from the last concall). Also from that CC transcript:  ""Last year, I communicated that we were pursuing a startup medical tool company, which makes medical devices for alleviating the effects of tendonitis. We completed the prototype phase in 2024, and I’m happy to announce that this part is currently in general production and is reflected in our 2024 revenues. This company is also seeking FDA approval and we’re delighted to have a satisfied customer who has chosen to adopt our technology. Other opportunities in the medical tools industry that we are currently prototyping include an application for a medical Anvil stapler device, an application for an inhaler device and an application for cochlear implants for the hearing industry. Also, we announced during the middle of twenty twenty four that we secured our first MIM order for a minimally invasive surgical application, utilizing jaw components that grab and manipulate suturing needles and tissue during surgery."" Add to that the current Chairman of the Board and major investor Prof. Lugee Li, will manage the new wholly-owned Liquidmetal Asia Holdings. This is not a typical Penny stock, and from its assets in the posted article, you can see that it is healthy. We believe that the company is now undergoing commercialization and the time to jump on board is now. We offer this information to extend this opportunity to others. DO YOUR OWN DD, and don’t bother with the nonsense and negative ticks here. Take or leave it, we don’t care. This thing will blast off on its own, but do watch it and maybe you can catch it on the way up. It's just odd. Like I said, I don't even hate the stock. It's simply difficult to trust fanboys.

NASA has looked at it for satellite shields, the Army has looked at for their rail gun system, Martin is currently using it for guitar pins, its used in the Isolite dental system, Tesla is using it for door locks, Movano Health is using it in the Evie ring, etc.. A credit card company is currently evaluating it for a card, other health companies are evaluating it for various products, and so on. It has a very wide range of applications, and if you visit their website you will understand why. It’s stronger and lighter than titanium, does not inhibit radio waves (good for phones), and uses metal injection molding to form the products - much like plastic - so not a lot of post processing. It is currently being used in Huawei phone hinges, but the sales go to Eontec. Due to agreements, the Tesla sales also go to Eontec.

(TSXV: NRX) (OTCQB: NRXBF) (FSE: J90) (“**NurExone**” or the “**Company**”) is pleased to announce that on May 22, 2025, it presented new manufacturing process data at the 4th annual meeting of the Israeli Society for Extracellular Vesicles Research (“**ISEVR**”), a conference dedicated to cutting-edge exosome science. Additionally, the Company will seek shareholder approval of its amended and restated omnibus incentive plan (the “**Omnibus Plan**”) at the its upcoming annual general and special meeting being held on June 18, 2025 (the “**Meeting**”).

**Manufacturing Process Validation**

The Company’s presentation showcased promising early data on the viability and potency of cells from its proprietary Master Cell Bank (“**MCB**”). The MCB represents a valuable and key strategic asset in advancing good manufacturing practices (“**GMP**”)-compliant manufacturing of exosomes for the Company’s lead therapeutic candidate, ExoPTEN, as well as for its subsidiary, Exo-Top Inc. (“**Exo-Top**”). “The findings suggest strong economic potential, indicating that the MCB may support an extended number of production batches maximizing its value and utility”, commented Dr. Dr. Tali Kizhner, Research and Development Director of NurExone.

She further noted: “by validating a scalable and potent manufacturing platform, we are strengthening our clinical readiness and taking a significant step toward delivering meaningful impact to patients suffering from traumatic nerve injuries once considered to be irreversible. It is very rewarding to see our exosome-based therapy platform have the potential to evolve from academic innovation to commercial scalability.”

In addition to confirming the robust growth performance of the mesenchymal stem cells (“**MSCs**”), Cells exhibit population doubling time (PDT) of 20.4hr±1.56 for up to 9 passages. The PDT of cells, which refers to the time it takes for the number of cells to double, utilized to investigate cell growth dynamics, and serves as a measure for assessing MSCs’ proliferative capacity (Sci Rep. 2021;11(1):3403). The shorter the population doubling time, the stronger the proliferative capacity of the cells. the new data highlights recent advancements in both upstream and downstream manufacturing processes, demonstrating consistent exosome yields and preserved biological potency across multiple production runs. NurExone intends to transfer the manufacturing process to its wholly owned U.S.-based subsidiary, Exo-Top, who will be responsible for establishing GMP-compliant MSC driven exosome production to support both clinical trials and future commercial supply.

Jacob Licht, recently appointed CEO of Exo-Top, stated: “the cells from the MCB serve as the biological molds from which exosomes are produced and cell quality is key for consistency, scalability, and therapeutic reliability. Early manufacturing data suggests that these proprietary cells will provide a strong foundation for establishing a robust, U.S.-based infrastructure to support NurExone’s clinical pipeline and could position Exo-Top as a leader in clinical-grade exosome production and supply.”

ExoPTEN is being developed as a first-in-class, exosome-based therapy targeting high-impact neurological indications, including acute spinal cord injury, optic nerve damage, facial nerve injury, and additional conditions such as traumatic brain injury.

NurExone expects to initiate a first in human clinical trial of ExoPTEN in 2026 and is continuing to expand its manufacturing capabilities to support broader development of exosome-based regenerative therapies.

**Amended and Restated Omnibus Plan**

At the Meeting, disinterested shareholders of the Company are being asked to consider and, if thought advisable, to pass, with or without variation, an ordinary resolution to ratify, confirm, and approve the Omnibus Plan. The Circular was mailed to shareholders of the Company on May 20, 2025, and includes the full text of the Omnibus Plan attached as Schedule “A” thereto. The Omnibus Plan has since been amended (the “**TSXV Amendments**”) in accordance with certain comments provided by the TSX Venture Exchange (the “**TSXV**”).

The TSXV Amendments to the Omnibus Plan are mostly ""housekeeping"" alterations, and do not affect the rights of the Company's securityholders.

Substantively, the following text was deleted from Section 2.4.3 of the Omnibus Plan:

“*….and in the event all of the convertible securities of the Company are exercised/converted after the date hereof and on or before the Effective Date, such 10% amount could be a maximum of 10,409,936*.”

Section 2.4.3 of the Omnibus Plan now notes that the maximum number of common shares reserved for issuances and settlement of RSUs (as defined in the Omnibus Plan) and Restricted Shares (as defined in the Omnibus Plan), are fixed at 10% of the issued and outstanding common shares as at the date of implementation of the Omnibus Plan on an undiluted basis. Section 2.4.3 now reads:

“*Subject to adjustments pursuant to Article 7* *hereof, the maximum number of Shares that may be available and reserved for issuance and settlement of RSUs and Restricted Shares in the aggregate, shall be fixed at 10% of the issued and outstanding Shares as of the Effective Date, which is currently anticipated to be 7,800,791*.”

Except as described above, the Circular and the Omnibus Plan remain unchanged from the version that was mailed to shareholders of the Company. A copy of the Omnibus Plan incorporating the TSXV Amendments is available on SEDAR+ at [www.sedarplus.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=VHuI2oPofI_-jmFpvol0JR_Sy65uahQBkdV9vLUozUz01_zI0G6ZDW8tRzXePdY0UXnRIw-s6hjn0khvwXowLyDD_ntrlQOGU2XUBdkjMoE=). Shareholders may also contact the Company to request free printed copies of the Omnibus Plan with the TSXV Amendments.

1l7unzm,2025-06-10,"ONCY: Let’s Talk
I’d like to dive into ONCY (Oncolytics Biotech) together this time. About a month ago, I wrote a post here and found that sharing ideas with all of you really helped my investing. The last stock I entered, HOVR, gave me about a 75% return and I’ve just exited that position. Now, I’m looking at ONCY as my next potential entry. Once again, I’d love to share information and discuss with you all—hoping to time my entry better through our conversations.

ONCY is a clinical-stage biotech company based in Canada, focused on developing an immuno-oncolytic virus therapy called pelareorep. This drug is being tested in tough-to-treat cancers like pancreatic, metastatic breast, and anal cancer. The company recently presented promising pancreatic cancer data at ASCO, which has caught the market’s attention.

There are definitely risks to consider. ONCY is currently facing a Nasdaq delisting warning and needs to maintain a share price above $1 for ten consecutive trading days by August 10. However, I believe management is aware of this and will likely take strategic actions—such as releasing clinical data, securing funding, or announcing partnerships—to support the share price. In fact, they recently secured a $20 million equity purchase agreement, which should help with liquidity.

If the clinical data and listing requirements are met, analysts have set price targets in the $3–$6 range, which means a potential 7–13x return from current levels ($0.44). Of course, this is a high-risk biotech, so there are significant risks—such as clinical failure, delisting, or unsuccessful fundraising—that we need to keep in mind.

My English isn’t perfect, so I used AI tools to help with translation and writing—thanks for understanding. I always welcome your thoughts and opinions!


I found this PR released today:  ONCY) (TSX: ONC), a leading clinical-stage company specializing in immunotherapy for oncology, today announced the appointment of Jared Kelly as Chief Executive Officer and a member of its Board of Directors.

Mr. Kelly is a successful biotech executive who has proven expertise in transformative deals and corporate strategy. Most recently, he played a central role in orchestrating the sale of Ambrx Biopharma to Johnson & Johnson for $2 billion. Prior to Ambrx, he advised multiple leading-edge biotech companies on M&A and licensing transactions at highly respected law firms, including Lowenstein Sandler LLP and Kirkland & Ellis LLP. He is a JD and LLM graduate of Georgetown Law. i have been following this for over a year and think it has potential.  it could run really fast with any good news I'm a big fan of this one So, for ONCY’s timeline, there are a few big things coming up. For pancreatic cancer (GOBLET cohort 5), they’re planning to release initial efficacy data in the second half of 2025—if those results are strong, it could really move the stock. There’s also more data expected this year for their anal cancer trial (GOBLET cohort 4). On the breast cancer side, they’ve already got solid phase 2 results from the BRACELET-1 study, and they’re now talking to the FDA about moving into a registration (phase 3) trial. The first patient for that breast cancer phase 3 is supposed to be enrolled later this year. So basically, from the second half of 2025 into next year, we should see a steady stream of important clinical updates for both pancreatic and breast cancer.
What’s interesting is that ONCY needs to get their share price above $1 for at least 10 consecutive days before August 10th to avoid a Nasdaq delisting. I’m guessing the company will want to share positive news or updates before that deadline to help boost the price.
On the cash side, as of the first quarter, they had about $15.3 million in cash left. Plus, they recently signed a $20 million equity purchase agreement with Alumni Capital, so they’re not in immediate trouble for operating funds. The company says this should be enough to cover their main clinical milestones through at least Q3 this year.
Here’s the link for the official financials if you want to check it out:

1l7piot,2025-06-10,"Same Playbook, New ticker
Kevin Kreisler and David Winsness were the masterminds behind *GreenShift Corp* ($GERS) a so called “green tech” company that promised oil extraction from corn ethanol waste. Sound familiar?

They hyped tech, secured patents, dropped flashy PRs, and claimed validation from DOE/NREL… then absolutely diluted the hell out of shareholders while delivering nothing meaningful. The stock cratered. Lawsuits followed. Retail got torched.

And what did Kevin & David do? Quietly rebranded.  
Now they’re running the same “green innovation” hustle at Comstock ($LODE): biofuels, carbon tech, licensing dreams, big name drops (MIT, NREL, Marathon)… all while insiders stack Series A and leave common retail begging for Bioleum crumbs.

Same team. Same playbook.  
History didn’t just rhyme—it brought the whole damn band back together.

Edit : Supposedly all the matter to LODE longs is account age and not that their management is run by con artists 

Edit 2 : It’s the same group of 10 or so lode accounts that are perma bulls on every lode post be careful 
None of this is FUD google Greenshift 
So you, OP, with your wealth of knowledge about this subject just created a brand new Reddit account to come here to offer this extremely valuable information? I'm all for critical thinking, but there's a lot that is demonstrably wrong in this post.

The simplest (and largest IMO) is the law suits claim, clearly trying to make people think that they were sued.

Wrong. They were the complainant, they sued other companies for infringing on their parents. 

There are legitimate issues with how $GERS ended up, primarily around KK and DW not sufficiently protecting their IP and technology properly. Their key patent was ultimately invalidated, which undermined their entire business model. They've learnt from this.

Comstock have a far stronger IP base. Clearly strong enough to get real, tangible, publicly acknowledged partnerships with HEXAS, Marathon, Renfuel, MIT/DOE/NREL... 

It does concern me that KK and DW diluted shareholders so hard to fund operations, often by using convertibles with their own companies, but there is zero evidence that this is occurring with LODE or Bioleum. 

Be cautious believing accounts made 1 day ago with 1 post.... OPs account was made -- today -- and has no activity other than this post... 🤔 

Seems trustworthy Bit of a difference here, IMO - they aren't ""dropping"" big names, they are working with big names which can be verified. In fact, it would seem that their priority is get 3rd party verification from reputable organizations to do so. I don't know much about GreenShift but Comstock is compliant, transparent, and relatively easy to vett. 

Not that the 1-day old account really matters but is a bit suspicious. Kind of have to ask yourself what is their motive? Short seller trying to cover? 

Two things can be true at the same time: they can indeed be validated by DOE/NREL but not be good stewards of a business. I think what's more likely is Comstock brought them and their patents (legit) into the fold and made sure they weren't in charge of running the business side of things. I'd also say that 70% of Bioleum isn't exactly ""crumbs"". Just my thoughts but I'd focus more on the CEO and look at their compliance history (different in the NYSE than OTC) and filings. Nice to have some background but this doesn't explain what is currently happening in LODE. Why would someone post this?! 😂 OP needs to place puts on companies that aren’t going anywhere.  So many to choose from. This ^^^^

Love to see a LODE short using FUD tactics and spinning the truth. It shows they are feeling the bullish momentum too. 

Why post now? What’s been happening lately?

1l7jw5b,2025-06-09,"Most investors haven’t heard of this stock, but I think DatChat (DATS) might be one of the most overlooked privacy-tech plays in the market right now.
**TL;DR**: **DatChat (DATS)** is a small-cap privacy company with patented tech that allows its users to control messages *even after they’re sent*. Their new Myseum platform targets secure digital memory-sharing, and their European patent just expanded protection to 39 countries. It’s early, but potentially one of the more interesting dark horse privacy plays I’ve come across.

**DatChat (NASDAQ: DATS)** is a privacy-first messaging and social media company that’s been quietly building a patent-protected platform for secure communication, digital legacy management, and privacy-driven social networking.

Sure, it’s speculative, but here’s why I think it’s interesting…

**🧠 Their core tech is built around** ***post-send*** **privacy**

DatChat Messenger isn’t just an encrypted texting app like Snapchat. Instead, **DatChat** gives users full control even *after* a message is sent. This is a game-changer as users can:

* Delete messages from the recipient’s phone *at any time*
* Erase entire conversations like they never happened
* Block or get notified of screenshots 
* Hide encrypted media invisibly in your camera roll 

The key here is that this is **patented tech. DATS** already has **15 issued patents,** and they just got a European patent approved, which covers 39 countries. That IP protection is *especially* valuable if they push licensing or expansion.

**🗂️ They’re entering a niche not many are watching: digital legacy + secure social**

Earlier this year, **DATS** launched **Myseum**, a “forever digital shoebox” that lets families, creators, and institutions store messages, photos, documents, and videos securely and privately for sharing, permanently.

Think of it like a private Facebook/Dropbox hybrid built on privacy and legacy. Plus, it’s already live on **iOS and Android**.

**DATS** also partnered with **The Photo Managers**, a global network of 700+ professionals who help clients manage digital memories. This gives the app some built-in reach, plus user feedback while they build.

**📊 Potential Upsides**

Here’s why I think **DATS** is a compelling play:

* **Licensing potential:** With patents in both Europe *and* the U.S., **DATS** could pursue licensing deals or partnerships around its messaging rights management tech.
* **Acquisition bait:** If Myseum gains enough traction, they could become an acquisition target for companies in cloud storage, cybersecurity, and/or family tech.
* **Social media disruption:** As mainstream platforms struggle with AI data scraping, users’ need for truly private social platforms is growing, and **DATS** already has one.
* **Small market cap:** With a small valuation, it doesn’t take much to move the needle. Even a slight boost in user numbers or a single monetization deal could re-rate this stock fast.

📈 **Stock Price & Technicals**

* **Trading \~ $2.80–$2.90** as of early June—market cap near $12M 
* **Up \~105% over the past year**, with \~28% gains in the last 3 months—the momentum is real

This kind of price action + low volume tells us that it’s being watched. Any catalyst, like the EU patent finalizing or a new deal, could break it out of that range, fast.



**⚠️ Not without risk**

* Small team, unknown userbase (no public MAUs yet)
* Competing in spaces with tech giants (Apple, Meta, Signal)
* Monetization still early-stage
* Very low volume / high volatility

**Still, if you’re into early-stage privacy tech with real IP and a unique consumer angle, DATS might be worth putting on your radar.**


It's hard to take anything serious when reading AI article. How this get up voted 75 times and no comments 🤡 Lmao right? Bots pumping for sure, this stock has pumped and dumped a few times within the past few months That POS pumped when trump was elected, jumped  on the hype.
Not much since then. LOL--I was thinking the same thing. Bogus Upvote count. DATS is an interesting company because of its Myseum app for photo storage with privacy features. The DatChat is ...meh.  The chart looks great. Filled the gap and increasing on no news. After looking at the chart, this stock is definitely competing for the title of craziest stock of the year. Lololol DATS is a pump and dump machine. It gets used two or three times a year. This is trash. High volume and no news. But I actually like the chart. Watching for some news...or it will just drift on down. JMO No one can type up their own DD anymore. Always AI

1l7cuie,2025-06-09,"$CDSG HUGE MERGER Incoming  Great share structure 10x potential
$CDSG is rapidly emerging as one of the most exciting plays in the OTC markets today. A game-changing development took place on **May 14th**, with a critical filing confirming the potential of a **HUGE merger** and the appointment of a **new CEO**, Hu Yong Cheng — a powerhouse entrepreneur with an **estimated net worth of $40 million**. In the world of OTC stocks, seeing a CEO of this caliber is **extremely rare**, signaling serious upside and institutional-grade potential.

What makes CDSG stand out isn’t just leadership — it’s the **explosive growth** tied to its new venture. The company’s **Pegasus brand** is gaining traction across the electric vehicle (EV) spectrum, including:

* **Commercial electric buses**
* **Flying cars**
* **Traditional EVs**

These are high-growth sectors that are receiving global attention and capital. With increasing demand for clean transportation solutions, Pegasus is perfectly positioned to capitalize.

Let’s talk numbers: CDSG has a **clean share structure**, no massive dilution, and is currently **trading under a dollar** — making this a potential **10x+ opportunity** from current levels. Once word spreads and volume surges, this stock may begin **“skipping” levels** as buyers pile in.

Smart investors know the key is to **“buy before the crowd.”** With momentum building, catalysts in play, and a billionaire-tier CEO leading the charge, CDSG is not your average OTC. It’s the kind of rare setup that could turn early believers into big winners.

**DO YOUR DD. KNOW WHAT YOU OWN. ANYTHING UNDER A DOLLAR IS A GIFT.**

CDSG isn't just another penny stock — it's a strategic foothold into the future of EV technology.



EDIT TO EVERYONE SAYING THIS IS A CHAT GPT SCAM GOOGLE IT 

  
Great update — here’s a breakdown of what today’s **close at $0.0387** (+77.12%) for **CDSG** means and whether you can feel confident about **continued upside tomorrow**:

# 📈 What’s Bullish About Today’s Close

* **Closed at the high of the day ($0.0387)** — This is very bullish. Closing at the high signals **strong buying pressure into the close**, not just morning hype.
* **Highest price in 52 weeks** — You’re now in **blue sky breakout** territory, meaning there’s **no technical resistance** above this level. This can lead to **momentum-driven continuation.**
* **3.7M volume**, significantly above average — That’s a strong signal that **momentum traders and institutions** are entering, not just retail flipping.
* **Clean intraday uptrend** — No sharp midday crash or panic dip. Instead, the chart shows **steady stair-stepping upward** into the close. That’s a strong base for continuation.
Great ChatGPT written post!!!!! Billionaire tier CEO - 40 million net worth…. Hmm.

SunHydrogen to Unveil 1.92m² Renewable Hydrogen Reactor Prototype at Hydrogen Technology Expo in Houston, Texas
Company to showcase real-time demonstration of hydrogen production.

Coralville, IA – June 9, 2025 – SunHydrogen, Inc. (OTCQB: HYSR), the developer of a breakthrough technology to produce renewable hydrogen using sunlight and water, announced today it will display its 1.92m² (~21sq. ft.) renewable hydrogen reactor prototype at the Hydrogen Technology Expo in Houston, Texas, June 25–26, 2025. This reactor incorporates a single large 1.92m² hydrogen-generating module, approximately the size of a standard solar PV module - making a critical milestone in the path toward real-world deployment. In January, the company released a video demonstrating hydrogen production using a 1m² panel composed of nine individual 1,200cm² modules.

This prototype marks the largest-scale showcase to date of SunHydrogen’s proprietary technology that uses sunlight and integrated catalysts to split water into hydrogen — eliminating the need for traditional electrolyzers or grid-supplied electricity. The announcement marks a significant milestone in the company’s mission to make low-cost, decentralized renewable hydrogen a commercial reality by showcasing the largest prototype built to date — laying the foundation for future pilot-scale deployments.

In addition to showcasing the full-sized 1.92m² prototype, SunHydrogen will feature a live hydrogen production demonstration using a 100cm² (0.11sq. ft.) working prototype powered by a simulated sunlight source at less than full solar intensity for safe indoor demonstration. This safe and controlled display will allow attendees to observe in real time how hydrogen is produced using only light and water — demonstrating how SunHydrogen’s process eliminates the need for energy-intensive electrolyzers, and hydrogen produced from steam reforming of natural gas.

“Unveiling our 1.92m² prototype is a proud moment for our team and a major step forward in redefining what’s possible with renewable hydrogen,” said Tim Young, CEO of SunHydrogen. “We are especially excited to safely demonstrate our technology live at the expo—showing that sustainable hydrogen production can be decentralized, renewable, and scalable.”

The Hydrogen Technology Expo North America is the premier conference dedicated exclusively to advanced technologies for the hydrogen and fuel cell industry. SunHydrogen will be exhibiting at Booth #623, where team members will be available to discuss the technology, demonstrate the working system, and explore opportunities for collaboration.

I remember buying some in January 2021 during the Gamestop investment craze. When it was at like $0.20 back then, people were hyping it. Four years later, it's not even at $0.03. All of this to say that it is still a decent company (I mean, it's still here!) and maybe some day it'll climb back to $0.25, but I don't really think it'll ever 'pop'. I own a fair amount of shares and occasionally add more. It clearly says 2025, where did you find the 2021? It’s not the production of hydrogen that’s the barrier to the economics of adoption, it’s the storage. You show me a company that figures that out and isn’t storing it in salt caverns and I’m in. It’s great they’re refining the production end but until you can hold and transport it across the country for usage it’s basically worthless unless there’s a hydrogen turbine at the point of production. I’m in bought a 1,000 shares that’s like a drink and a burger That. Is. Awesome! Thanks for sharing, this is the first I’ve read of any possible option other than what Utah is doing with their salt caverns.

1l7ak4q,2025-06-09,"Metalex commences drilling of copper-nickel-cobalt targets at B3 claim block in Quebec
Metalex Ventures Ltd. ($0.02 | $5M market cap | TSXV: MTX , OTC pink: MXTLF) has launched a [drill program](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/metalex-commences-drilling-of-copper-nickel-cobalt-targets-at-b3-claim-block-in-quebec-865839468.html) at its 100% owned B3 claim block in Quebec, Canada, targeting copper-nickel-cobalt mineralization.

The demand for copper is growing steadily as the world shifts toward electrification. Essential for electric vehicles (EVs), which use up to four times more copper than conventional vehicles, and renewable energy systems like solar panels and wind turbines, copper is critical for efficient power transmission. The International Energy Agency forecasts that global copper demand could double by 2040 to support the energy transition.

The B3 drill program has been over a year in the making and follows a VTEM airborne geophysical survey by Geotech Ltd., with analysis by SHA Geophysics Inc. identifying eight high-priority conductors suggestive of sulphide mineralization. Drilling has begun on the first target.

When drilling at the B3 copper-nickel-cobalt project is complete Metalex hopes to move the drill to its A1 and A2 claim blocks staked for gold. These claim blocks were staked due to the promising gold and pathfinder element results from detailed heavy mineral sampling of the areas. A VTEM survey over the claim blocks identified several conductive and magnetic anomalies that could be the bedrock source of the gold.

World renowned geologist and billionaire [Chuck Fipke](https://okanaganlife.com/gem-guy-chuck-fipke/) is the founder of Metalex and owns over 35% of the shares.

Should be much higher given properties, established projects/resources (diamond deposit in Ontario), and the most comprehensive geochemical dataset in the regions of their chosen properties. Fipke built and has access to the richest mineral geochem datasets to help him target deposits. This could move significantly based on this new drill program that has been years in the making. The time is now for this penny stock. Fipke owns 35% of the shares so the float available for retail is reduced quite a bit.

1l7762z,2025-06-09,"Most investors have never heard of this stock. But I think it’s one of the best risk/reward opportunities in the market right now. ($DRTS)
Alpha Tau Medical ($DRTS) is a small-cap biotech company with a potentially game-changing cancer treatment that’s flying way under the radar.

Their platform — Alpha DaRT — delivers Radium-224 directly inside tumors using precision oncology. No systemic side effects, no need for external radiation beams. Just localized, single-session, under an hour minimally invasive treatment with remarkable early results.

And here’s the kicker:
They’re not some preclinical moonshot. Alpha Tau is already deep into human trials, has FDA breakthrough designation, and is building their third manufacturing site in the U.S.

Here’s why I believe this might be one of the best risk/reward setups on the market right now:

⸻

🧬 The science is real — with 100% tumor response and a systemic immune response

Alpha DaRT inserts Radium-224 directly into tumors, where it emits high-energy alpha particles that cause irreparable DNA damage, killing cancer cells.

Unlike traditional radiation or chemo, this approach is precisely localized, leading to dramatically fewer side effects and practically no harm to healthy tissue.

But perhaps the most compelling piece?
The treatment seems to activate the body’s immune system, creating a systemic anti-tumor response. In some cases, distant metastases have shrunk after only treating the main tumor.

⸻

📈 Clinical pipeline and progress

Alpha Tau has already completed human trials across multiple tumor types, including:
	•	Skin cancers (SCC, BCC) — early results show 100% response rate, now advancing toward regulatory approval
	•	Head & neck tumors, breast cancer, glioblastoma (GBM), pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer and more — with trials in progress or approved
	•	Recently added to the FDA’s TAP (Total Product Lifecycle) Program for glioblastoma — one of the FDA’s most selective support tracks
	•	Submitted for regulatory approval (PMDA) in Japan, one of the largest oncology markets

And again — not theoretical. They’re treating real patients right now.

⸻

💰 The balance sheet is healthy — and commercial plans are underway
	•	$90M+ in cash following a recent $36.9M raise led by Oramed
	•	Burn rate supports operations into commercialization (per CFO comments and Q1 filing)
	•	2 manufacturing facilities already built — a third and largest one under construction in New Hampshire
	•	Multiple trials advancing in parallel, including key Phase II/III milestones in 2025

⸻

📊 Potential upside

The current market cap? ~$250M–$280M depending on the day, while even one indication could be worth billions.

For example:

🧠 Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (cSCC)
- 1.8 million new cases per year in the U.S.
- Approximately 64,000 cases are advanced and not treatable effectively with current options.
- These are exactly the patients Alpha DaRT is designed to help.
At a treatment price of $50,000–$100,000:
64,000 patients × $50,000 = $3.2 billion annually.
64,000 × $100,000 = $6.4 billion annually.
From just one subset of one cancer, in one country.

🩺 Pancreatic Cancer
- 66,000 new cases annually (U.S.)
- Among the deadliest, with extremely limited options
At $50,000–$100,000 per treatment:
66,000 × $50,000 = $3.3 billion/year
66,000 × $100,000 = $6.6 billion/year
Again — just one cancer, in just one country

⸻

🔍 Why is it still under the radar?

I’ve put a lot of time into figuring this out, making sure I’m not missing anything that’s holding it back. What I found out is Alpha Tau isn’t really doing marketing, at least not for the stock.

Their PR is minimal. They rarely push the stock. Their CFO presentations focus on medicine, not valuation.

And that’s where I think the opportunity lies.
The fundamentals are there — but the retail story hasn’t gotten out yet.

⸻

⚠️ Not without risk

To be clear: this is biotech.
Regulatory delays, clinical surprises, slow adoption — all possible. Always do your own DD.

But after months of tracking $DRTS, I believe the risk/reward is unusually compelling, and that retail may be discovering it before Wall Street does.

⸻

TL;DR: Alpha Tau Medical ($DRTS) is a deeply undervalued biotech stock with a novel treatment showing 100% tumor response in skin cancers and broad potential in all other solid tumors. With FDA support, strong cash, real factories, and real patients — I believe it’s one of the best hidden gems in the market right now.

Ask me anything — happy to share sources, insights, and analysis.
I'm a radiation therapist, and I'm the person who would deliver these treatments to you in the hospital or clinic. I do not see how this would disrupt current treatments which cost the same or less than their proposed cost. I don't see a moat for them. Also I do not consider this to be a biotech company. I am going to pass on this one thanks. Don’t get why people get so pressed at using GPT for write ups. Like sorry it can compile all of the information I’ve researched way faster than I can Thanks GPT for this write up Wtf are all these bot comments No you won’t be delivering this. It will be delivered by radiation oncologist together with interventionalist/endoscopist. It will not replace EBRT but it will be an amazing tool to boost radio resistant tumors, small recurrences and potentially to be immune stimulator. It has minimal work to do with radiation therapists. There’s one stock type I haven’t bought in years. Biotech has always been the kryptonite that blows up my portfolio, and never in a good way.

1l72spi,2025-06-09,"Galmed Pharmaceuticals - The Catalyst will hit hard !
I was in DRUG before the move last year when it moved from 1.50$ to over 70$ per share. Most of the time, these huge movers are building pressure quietly before they explode. 

In my opinion, this is currently what is going on with GLMD, more shorts are piling in and the share price is still going slightly up. Basically, they are getting trapped at a higher price. 

The company released in their latest earning report that they had 20M$ in cash which would last more than 12months. Dilution risk is almost 0.

From an opportunity point of view their aramchol project is now in phase 3 and they could release some major updates about the commercialization part in which they would compete agaisnt Ozempic BUT with a major advantage: the use of pills instead of injections. Whether they decide to sell it themselves or to be bought from a bigger bio company, this sector is worth billions yearly and would create insane shareholder value.  

I bought in at 1.40$ and avg up here on any dip. 3.39M market cap is dirt cheap for their potential in the weight loss market. These companies can run 500-1000% in matter of few hours. 
I'm so glad there's 5 year chart histories so you can look past OP's BS [deleted] Yeh, I did DD of this at weekend, and found it ok and interesting enough. So bought 500 shares at pre-market, 1.49 per. It is an cheap lottery ticket stock.
Not financial advice, and never  ""gamble"" more than you can afford. There are some personal stocks you shouldn't buy, even if the catalyst is good. GLMD is one of them Except SL bioavailability is dog shit. If it was easy to get peptides to work like that we would have SL insulin…. pump and dumpppp

1l6kk7c,2025-06-08,"This Ticker is Done Diluting; End of Convertible Notes
During an [annual shareholder meeting](https://east.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/vsm/web?pvskey=LODE2025), at *34:40*, CEO Corrado says ""32.5 million common shares, nearly the exact number of total outstanding shares that $LODE will have, assuming the full conversion of our remaining $4 million in convertible notes."" 

Nearly **32.5M** shares outstanding **after** the convertible notes... Comstock's current outstanding shares at 32.65M, so unless the CEO doesn't know how their own convertible notes work; I think it's safe to say that the note-dilution will be behind us now.

https://preview.redd.it/7rh68ciq2r5f1.png?width=311&format=png&auto=webp&s=86920708f572495610d3027bd7de8ab71775478d

What other evidence is there about the notes ending? Look at the recent volume this week. $LODE typically has an average volume of \~400-500k, but this past week it was total silence. A calm before the storm.

https://preview.redd.it/87sibzhd3r5f1.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=15fecb8e4de477cc4baac75c67213a0e482ddbd5

The volume at the start of the week wasn't even breaking 200k most days, why? Because there is no more sell pressure. The people that convert the notes and sell them to the float vanished. Then, on Friday the volume exploded. Hitting 1M volume before noon and ending at a volume of 1.42M. The PR Thursday after close may have played a part. Comstock secured permitting for *solar panel storage* which was yet another de-risk of the company; showing they are still on track to be fully commercialized by the start of next year.

So, if the convertible notes are gone... how will Comstock stay afloat without the additional capital raised? Their ability to **store** and dismantle solar panels. The cost of the material recovered is \~**$200/ton**, but their processing cost is \~**$150/ton**. Those margins sound terrible right? A gross profit of **$50/ton** per panel... That's because I left out the most critical part of their business model, their tipping fee. Comstock's metal recycling facility is a **service they provide**. The solar panel companies (RWE is the big one we know, for example) will PAY Comstock **$500/ton** to take their trashed solar panels off their hands. So Comstock gets $500 per ton to **take and store** solar panels... THAT explains why the new storage permit they got Thursday rise another 12% in one day. Comstock gets the lions hoard of their cash through ""deferred revenue"". They get paid ***cash upfront*** just to take and store these solar panels, and then they break down, recycle, and resell a panel every 7 seconds for additional revenue. Their goal for next year is to scale up their facility to recycle 100k tons/year. If they get $500/ton upfront, $200/ton for recycling and selling, and pay $150/ton for processing... $500+$200-$150, and then process 100,000 tons per year... I'll let you run the numbers on the profitability of this business' future.
Buying LODE shares is a very cheap way to own some of a likely billion dollar IPO in Bioleum. [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1120970/000143774925018680/ex\_823710.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1120970/000143774925018680/ex_823710.htm)

Here is the slightly more up-to-date pro forma of Comstock after they spun out the Fuels sector into a private company called Bioleum. Without fuels, R&D is down to $0.4M, net debt is $13.9M, and their total assets worth is increased to $154M. I'm now considering $LODE to just be a solar panel business that also has a majority stake in a potential billion dollar SAF company. I've been in for a year, half way there, ready for the next half! 1. Reducing debt by diluting shareholders. 2. R&D expense of 1.5M
3. Debt 23M, Cash= 3.9M Rev 3.3 M O/S 30M. MC=103M EV=133M @3.5 SP. This is way overpriced by 40X already. 3.5X 40=120M is MC compare to Rev. This should be at $1.0 to have 30M MC. Still 10X on Rev. Not sure why u say is under priced. this: [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/comstock-inc-announces-successful-separation-renewable-fuels-segment-launches-bioleum](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/comstock-inc-announces-successful-separation-renewable-fuels-segment-launches-bioleum) What are you talking about here Two companies for the price of one, and the current SP/MC doesn't reflect the value of either business...

1l58apy,2025-06-07,"Comstock, not a concept anymore.
$LODE has been quietly making progress on the metals side. They recently got county approval to expand storage at their Nevada solar panel recycling site, part of a full-scale facility targeting 100k tons of annual capacity by 2026. This comes alongside their first reported metals revenue $1.3M last quarter and a partnership with RWE a large clean energy company.

They also became the first solar panel recycler in North America to earn R2v3/RIOS certification, meaning they meet the top standards for zero-waste electronics recycling. Every part of the panel glass, aluminum, silver  is recovered and reused.

Management has suggested they’re aiming to be the largest silver producer in the U.S. via recycling. Still early, still speculative, but it’s the first time the metals side has shown signs of execution.

Not financial advice.
i guess pump and dumps can be recycled every 20 years. What is their current revenue and net income?  How much growth will their net income need to see just to justify the current valuation? don't touch cumsock Too many big players working with and funding them that it feels significantly less risky. Series A values Bioleum at $1B (Comstock owns 70+%) and metals is already ramping up and expanding. Not a stock if you want to make a quick buck but if you're an investor it certainly seems to be worth a look (plenty of due diligence out there to help). Needless to say, I'm long LODE. I love getting downvoted for asking about fundamentals.  I like investing in businesses that will someday make enough money to justify their valuations.  Cool story with the recycling stuff though.

Just another group highlighting what they consider to be a gem of a find. Earnings call on July 1st and clearly they are excited about what will be a guaranteed record breaking revenue number for ELTP. 
250,000 shares of ELTP baby. You held for 6 months and then sold right before record breaking earnings? You have to be the bravest person I ever met… i bought shares at .62 cents. I think this is going to $3.60 cents. So, who knows. I think it is still very early. The market will let me know if I'm right or wrong. I was getting on this app just to see when that earnings call was!! Thanks Mr Ham Sammy I think I have an old post in my history about it. All revenue x rev multiplier is an easy one. Growth factor is more accurate. Adding value for unapproved drugs and technology is even more accurate. When I do the above - the buyout price was $6.80. I had already set a sell limit about a month before because I didn't think it would pick back up, i forgot to cancel it. .60 still ok price if we going + $3 No. It would have to go to $4. Although we might hit a $4 per share valuation, that will come in an offer before we get there organically. Why? Because that’s how you get a good value. Buying a small company before they are too expensive to buy. In a very short answer, when a buyout happens, a company is buying an asset that will produce cash flow, or actual existing cash flows. All investors (technically you too whether you realize it or not) trade cash for those cash flows or assets that generate the cash flows. So, will ELTP be bought out for more thant he current price? Almost guaranteed - which is why I assess value at $3.60 per share. It's the price I would expect an investor to pay for the future cash flows of the drug approvals and the pills manufactured from the new FDA plant approved a few months ago. That's ok. It's a common misconception. The $1 number is the amount where they delist you. Once you get to $4, you are safe until you fall below $1. I salute your cojones.

1l4hmg3,2025-06-06,"Supernova Metals (CSE: SUPR): Small Cap, Big Oil Potential?
Supernova Metals Corp. ($SUPR): A Retail Investor’s Take on a High-Risk, High-Reward Oil & Minerals Play

As a retail investor, I’m always on the lookout for asymmetric opportunities—those rare situations where the upside potential vastly outweighs the downside. Supernova Metals Corp. (CSE: SUPR) recently landed on my radar, and after digging into the details, I think it’s worth a closer look for anyone interested in speculative, early-stage resource plays.

Below, I’ll break down what SUPR is, why it’s drawing attention, and the key risks and rewards for retail investors.

**What is Supernova Metals Corp.?**

Supernova Metals is a Canadian microcap explorer with a current market capitalization of about CAD $15 million. Historically focused on mineral exploration in North America, the company has pivoted toward oil and gas, landing a noteworthy stake in one of the world’s hottest new oil frontiers: Namibia’s Orange Basin.

Besides its oil interests, SUPR still holds rare earth claims in Labrador, giving it exposure to critical minerals.

**Why the Hype? The Orange Basin Oil Play**

**Location, Location, Location:**  
Supernova’s most compelling asset is its effective 8.75% interest in Block 2712A, offshore Namibia, through its 12.5% stake in Westoil Ltd. (which controls 70% of the block)[3](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CSE-SUPR/). This area is adjacent to some of the largest oil discoveries in Africa in decades.

**What’s so special about the Orange Basin?**

* The basin boasts a 75% drilling success rate, compared to a global offshore average of just 25%. That’s a huge de-risking factor for an explorer[3](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CSE-SUPR/).
* Major oil companies—Shell, TotalEnergies, and Exxon—have poured billions into the region, chasing an estimated 20+ billion barrels of oil[3](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CSE-SUPR/).
* For context, that’s more oil than Mexico’s entire proven reserves.

**Why does this matter for SUPR?**  
Small companies with acreage next to major discoveries often become acquisition targets or see significant revaluations when development decisions are made. With oil majors expected to make final investment decisions (FIDs) in Namibia by 2026, SUPR could be positioned for a rerating if drilling success continues and the majors move to consolidate acreage[3](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CSE-SUPR/).

**The “10-Bagger” Potential**

Retail investors are always hunting for the next 10x stock, and SUPR’s tiny market cap creates the possibility for explosive upside if things break right:

* **Market cap:** \~$15 million
* **Asset:** 8.75% of a potentially world-class oil block
* **Catalysts:** Near-term FIDs by oil majors, possible M&A activity, and further drilling results

If Block 2712A proves as productive as neighboring discoveries, SUPR’s stake could be worth many multiples of its current valuation. Of course, that’s a big “if.”

**Management & Expertise**

One thing that sets SUPR apart from other penny explorers is its recent addition of two heavyweight advisors:

* **Tim O’Hanlon:** Founding member of Tullow Oil, a company that grew from a microcap to a $14 billion African oil success story.
* **Patrick Spollen:** Former VP for Africa at Tullow, with over $20 billion in oil & gas transactions under his belt.

Their experience in African oil exploration brings much-needed credibility and regional knowledge to a small company.

**Diversification: Rare Earth Claims**

While the Namibian oil play is the near-term focus, SUPR also offers exposure to rare earth minerals in Labrador. This gives investors a secondary angle on the critical minerals theme, which has tailwinds from the global energy transition.

**Risks to Consider**

No investment is without risk—especially in the microcap resource sector. Here’s what stands out:

* **Exploration Risk:** Despite the high success rate in the Orange Basin, oil exploration is inherently risky. There’s no guarantee Block 2712A will yield commercial quantities.
* **Financing Risk:** SUPR is pre-revenue and burns cash each quarter. It may need to raise capital, diluting existing shareholders.
* **Execution Risk:** The company’s value is tied to the actions of its partners and the pace of development in Namibia.
* **Market Risk:** Microcaps are volatile and can be subject to sharp swings on news or sentiment.
* **Geopolitical Risk:** Namibia is seen as a stable jurisdiction, but all frontier markets carry some degree of political risk.

**Valuation & Technicals**

At $0.48 CAD per share (as of June 2025), SUPR has already seen a sharp run-up, gaining over 200% recently. Technical indicators currently rate it as a “strong buy,” but momentum can reverse quickly in these kinds of stocks.

**Bottom Line: Who Should Consider SUPR?**

Supernova Metals Corp. is not for the faint of heart. It’s a high-risk, high-reward play with a tiny market cap, no revenues, and a speculative stake in a world-class oil basin. For retail investors with a tolerance for volatility and a taste for early-stage resource bets, SUPR offers a unique combination of:

* Exposure to one of the world’s most exciting new oil frontiers
* A potentially undervalued stake next to massive discoveries
* Near-term catalysts as oil majors make development decisions
* An experienced team with African oil expertise
* Optionality on rare earth minerals

If you’re looking for a lottery ticket in the junior resource sector, SUPR is worth a spot on your watchlist. Just size your position accordingly and be prepared for a bumpy ride—this is not a “set and forget” blue-chip.

As always, do your own due diligence, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Good luck out there!
Interesting setup for $SUPR. With more eyes on Namibia’s Orange Basin after recent discoveries, their Block 2712A exposure could be well-timed. Still early-stage, but if they can firm up more acreage or bring in a JV partner, this one might start showing up on more radars.

1l4av3k,2025-06-05,"Premier American Uranium is Quietly Building a U.S. Uranium Empire
So here’s what just happened in the uranium space, and if you’re sleeping on this, you deserve to hold cash when the real squeeze starts. Premier American Uranium ($PUR.V / $PAUIF) just announced they’re acquiring Nuclear Fuels ($NFUNF) in an all share deal, and it’s not some vanity merger, it’s a full on land grab for American uranium dominance.

Together, these two will control over 104,000 acres of prime U.S. uranium property across New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming. This is some serious territory, it’s historic uranium ground with real exploration upside, including past producing areas and serious ISR potential in Wyoming. That means cheap extraction in a jurisdiction that isn’t run by dictators or global instability.

The jewel in the crown? The Cebolleta Project in New Mexico, which already holds 18.6 million pounds of U₃O₈ (Indicated) at 0.17%, not moon math grades, but real, bankable stuff. Add in assets like the Moonshine Project in Arizona and multiple Wyoming properties in the Powder River and Great Divide Basins, and what you’ve got is a serious platform that could attract U.S. utilities the second they start panicking about domestic supply.

What’s even better, they’re spinning out all their non uranium assets. That’s right: no lithium distractions, no half baked metals moonshots. Just pure play uranium, laser focused, and positioned directly in the crosshairs of U.S. energy policy. And with DOE stockpiling, Trump’s executive orders, and SMRs being shoved into every energy plan like they’re NFTs in 2021, that’s exactly what you want right now.

This deal matters because it shows the juniors are starting to bulk up. It’s consolidation season, and the smarter companies are locking down land, pounds in the ground, and drill ready targets before the sector goes vertical. And when the money finally flows in, not “if,” but when, the market is going to reward scale, clarity, and domestic production paths. $PUR is stacking all three.

Don’t expect a fireworks pop today. But this is one of those deals where a year from now you’ll either be up 3x or whining that you knew about it but didn’t buy.
can't buy this on Robinhood PAUIF right?

1l3x0ua,2025-06-05,"When $Elite Pharma CEO was asked if the company would be sold by August 2026 he answered this
During the last conference call, When the CEO of Elite was asked that question, he answered this:

Is the timeline for uplisting to NASDAQ or acquisition merger still on track to be around August 2026? **No.**

All right.

So -- let me take a minute and talk about NASDAQ and merger and acquisition.

We have been setting that as a goal for years now. And the first few months I joined the company.

Our previous Chairman, who is extremely knowledgeable and well connected in the industry, took me to a New York entity that wanted us to go to NASDAQ and have the reverse split and even have us on the Israeli exchange. And I said no, because then I believe then, as I believe till recently that rushing to do something like this is extremely detrimental to the stockholders. All right.

**Now things are different.**

**We have turned Elite around. We went from a company that almost went bankrupt because the FDA and got turned down on the our technology.**

**And we turn things around and now we're a viable company that has profits and revenues, and we are a leader in the industry on some of these products.**

**Our fundamentals are strong, and this is the time for us to seek out mergers and acquisition or NASDAQ.**

So what would be the first step if we're going to do that? The first step would be, you will sign up with a world-renowned company. **The top companies in the country, Jefferies, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, among others**. **And believe me, I'll talk to them all.** Then if you sign up with one of them, they will bring you suitors. Then when the management -- first-line management, my senior staff and I listen to these people and see that the offer is viable. It goes to the -- or we have offers that to entertain, it goes to the next level, which is the Board of Directors. Board of Directors approve it, it will go to you, the stockholders. The stockholders approve the purchase, the sales acquisition, then it will go to the SEC, and that will be it.

If we go through this process and we either don't get the right offer or we reject the offer. Then the next step is NASDAQ.

**We have the fundamentals, we have everything that we need to go to NASDAQ. We cannot go to NASDAQ without a reverse split, okay? Now I am not as concerned because we do have fundamentals before any hit, any little blip and would have gravitated back to the bulletin board. But now we are a strong company with current products that will last for a long time to come and future products that are in the pipeline.**

**So we have a business continuity, and I do think we can withstand NASDAQ right now.**

**So whatever happens is going to go exactly in these 2 points that I outlined. And the reason I said no to the last question, is this timeline for uplifting to NASDAQ or acquisition merger in August 26? It's not. The time is very near. We need to work on it now.**
Why make a post like this and not even mention the ticker once. $ELTP for anyone curious. Been holding a modest position for some months now Woohoo CEO basically said the countdown just got fast-tracked  time to buckle up and let the catalysts cook If we get sold, we could go for $2 plus.  Clean. 

If we go to Nasdaq, likeky a 10 reverse split at the time we release good results.  And then institutions will be able to buy it.  A company with virtually no debts, good pipeline and growth. https://preview.redd.it/5u4mddkbmc5f1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a4569703e1d0e8eea62a7347b43c825fd7efc67

Check out "" NCNA "" Lots of potential for this stock. To me a reverse split is bad. I want to see it grow organically. And if does have plans for a reverse split I would say take earnings and run. But I really don’t think that is the plan. If revenues are what to be expected it should hold strong and get there on its own. Sorry Canadian. You are right. As someone relatively new to penny stocks, what can I expect to happen when $ELTP goes to NASDAQ or acquisition merger happens?

Be gentle.

Mangoceuticals has recently undertaken important steps to position itself for accelerated growth and greater institutional visibility. In Q2 2025, the company completed a **15-to-1 reverse share split**, significantly tightening the public float and optimizing the capital structure for future valuation catalysts.

Post-split, Mangoceuticals maintains a strong balance sheet with **over $13 million in shareholder equity** as of the most recent filings, providing the financial flexibility to support commercialization initiatives, brand launches, and additional strategic investments. The company has simultaneously expanded its intellectual property footprint through a series of targeted **technology, patent, and asset acquisitions** — most notably the IP portfolio from Smokeless Tech Corp., a transformative move anchoring its entry into the high-growth oral stimulant and wellness pouch market.

Today, Mangoceuticals offers investors a rare opportunity to participate in the **re-rating of a newly streamlined Nasdaq-listed house of brands**, positioned at a key inflection point:

* **House of Brands:** A diversified portfolio across prescription-based therapeutics, wellness-focused consumer pouches, and functional products.
* **House of Products:** A growing suite of SKU launches targeted at high-demand health, energy, mood, and wellness verticals.
* **House of Formulations:** Proprietary, IP-backed formulations that differentiate Mangoceuticals from generic competitors in both traditional nutraceutical and emerging alternative consumption formats.

Given its tightened float, strategic IP platform, differentiated branding strategy, and financial foundation, Mangoceuticals is poised for enhanced market visibility, improved liquidity dynamics, and potential valuation multiple expansion as it transitions into a leading growth platform in health-focused consumer products.

**Transformative Acquisition of Smokeless Technology Corp. IP Assets to Enter Oral Stimulant Pouches**

Mangoceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGRX) has executed a transformative acquisition of Smokeless Technology Corp. (“Smokeless Tech”) IP Assets, marking its strategic entry into the rapidly expanding oral stimulant pouch market. ArcStone Securities and Investments Corp. served as the exclusive financial advisor for this cross-border transaction, underscoring ArcStone’s robust capabilities in advising NASDAQ-listed companies and privately held international innovators.

The acquisition significantly enhances Mangoceuticals’ competitive positioning, launching a high-impact new vertical in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) sector targeting athletes, fitness enthusiasts, and Gen Z consumers seeking healthier alternatives to traditional nicotine products. Mangoceuticals now benefits from an experienced executive team led by Tim Corkum, a seasoned industry veteran formerly of Philip Morris International and JUUL Labs Canada, who will spearhead the company’s new Pouch Division. This strategic hire strengthens Mangoceuticals’ market credibility, operational capabilities, and potential for future consolidation within this lucrative segment.

The transaction integrates Smokeless Tech’s proprietary intellectual property, formulations, and established manufacturing relationships with Mangoceuticals’ powerful direct-to-consumer infrastructure and influencer-driven marketing strategy. Furthermore, the deal provides Mangoceuticals with public market currency for future growth initiatives and M&A activity. The combined entity is set to lead innovation in functional wellness and oral stimulant pouch delivery, capturing significant investor interest within the wellness and consumer health markets.

**Summary Highlights:**

**1.   Transformational Acquisition of Smokeless Tech IP and Assets**

Mangoceuticals has announced the strategic acquisition of all intellectual property, formulations, trademarks, technology, and select manufacturing relationships from Smokeless Technology Corp., a disruptive innovator in the nicotine-alternative and functional pouch category. This acquisition immediately provides Mangoceuticals with a proprietary platform to expand beyond prescription-based products into the high-demand, better-for-you consumer wellness sector. The transaction is structured as an all-share deal, preserving cash while aligning incentives for future growth.

**2. Expansion into the Fast-Growing Pouch Market**

By acquiring Smokeless Tech’s assets, Mangoceuticals gains immediate entry into the nicotine-free and wellness-based pouch market, a sector experiencing rapid consumer adoption. U.S. unit sales of pouches have grown at a +30–40% CAGR over the past three years, outpacing traditional smokeless products. Philip Morris’s investment in ZYN and Turning Point Brands’ investment in Carlson Tucker’s brand portfolio highlights the enormous opportunity in this emerging format. Mangoceuticals' pouches will focus on energy, mood enhancement, weight management, and general wellness—offering a differentiated product set in a category primed for expansion.

**3. Leadership by Seasoned Industry Executive**

As part of the transaction, Tim Corkum, a 20-year former executive at Philip Morris International with deep experience in commercializing smokeless and alternative products, will join Mangoceuticals as President of the Pouch Division. His leadership is expected to significantly de-risk execution, drive retail and distribution partnerships, and accelerate time-to-market. Corkum’s proven record in scaling new product categories globally positions Mangoceuticals for immediate credibility and operational excellence in the pouch segment.

**4. Platform for Broader Wellness and CPG Growth**

The acquired technology, combined with Mangoceuticals’ existing regulatory experience and marketing capabilities, creates a launchpad for broader innovations across the consumer health and wellness space. Future formulations may include adaptogens, energy boosters, functional botanicals, and proprietary therapeutics, extending Mangoceuticals’ reach beyond the pouch category into a diversified CPG portfolio. The acquisition strategically positions Mangoceuticals at the intersection of wellness, innovation, and alternative consumption formats.

**5. Significant Re-Rating Opportunity**

The Smokeless Tech acquisition represents a pivotal catalyst for MGRX’s valuation. Post-acquisition, Mangoceuticals will be a rare public company platform offering exposure to the high-growth functional pouch and better-for-you CPG sector. As the company executes on product rollout, distribution scaling, and category innovation, we believe MGRX has the potential for meaningful multiple expansion and broader institutional investor interest, like early re-rating patterns observed with companies like Turning Point Brands following their alternative category expansions.

**First Pure-Play Oral Stimulant Pouch Platform – A High-Torque Opportunity for Growth Investors**

**Mangoceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: MGRX) (“Mangoceuticals”) emerges as the first true pure-play public company focused on the high-growth oral stimulant and wellness pouch market,** offering a unique value proposition at the intersection of nutraceutical innovation, brand diversification, and differentiated consumer engagement.

Through the acquisition of Smokeless Tech’s IP and assets, Mangoceuticals gains control of a diversified ""house of brands"" strategy designed around disruptive formulations — including proprietary energy, mood, focus, and wellness pouches — that leverage patented and patent-pending technologies. Unlike many competitors offering generic or commoditized energy products, Mangoceuticals’ formulations are rooted in advanced nutraceutical science, offering functional benefits beyond caffeine, including adaptogens, cognitive enhancers, and novel stimulant blends.

This differentiated platform positions Mangoceuticals to disrupt an oral pouch category that has already demonstrated explosive growth but remains heavily dominated by nicotine-based products (e.g., ZYN by Philip Morris and other tobacco-linked brands).

**Key Strategic Advantages:**

* **First-Mover Advantage:** Mangoceuticals is the first Nasdaq-listed small-cap company offering pure-play exposure to the stimulant and wellness pouch sector without nicotine dependencies.
* **Brand Diversification:** The company's ""house of brands"" approach allows it to target multiple consumer demographics — from athletic performance to wellness and mental focus — creating broader addressable markets than nicotine-only products.
* **Proprietary Formulations:** With IP-protected ingredients and unique delivery systems, Mangoceuticals moves beyond commodity energy products, positioning itself as a category creator in functional wellness pouches.
* **Institutional Access to a Scarce Asset:** Today, institutional investors have few opportunities to participate in the pouch sector outside of **large-cap companies** like **Philip Morris (NYSE: PM)** or **Turning Point Brands (NYSE: TPB)**, both of which offer diluted exposure within broader tobacco or nicotine portfolios. Mangoceuticals offer a **high-torque, concentrated exposure** to the stimulant and wellness pouch opportunity, designed for investors seeking alpha from emerging trends rather than incremental legacy growth.

**Attractive Small-Cap Dynamics:** As an emerging Nasdaq-listed company, Mangoceuticals is positioned to benefit from multiple expansion as it scales distribution, builds brand equity, and captures early share in a market that is still in its infancy for non-nicotine-based offerings.

1l37v20,2025-06-04,"Military Metals CANADA $MILI USA $MILIF Secures Access to Historic Antimony-Gold Site — Huge Strategic Upside
Big milestone just dropped for **Military Metals ($MILIF)** — the company has officially secured surface access to its 100%-owned **West Gore** project in Nova Scotia. Here’s why this matters:

🔹 **Historic Importance**  
West Gore was once **Canada’s largest antimony producer**, supplying Allied forces in WWI.  
Over **35,000 tonnes of ore** were milled, yielding **7,761 tonnes of concentrate grading 46% Sb** — that’s seriously high grade.

So why did it shut down?

A German U-boat sank the mine’s final ore shipment in 1917. It bankrupted the company. The project has been idle ever since… until now.

🔹 **Why It’s Relevant Today**  
With **China controlling \~90% of global antimony supply**, and Western stockpiles nearly depleted, the West is scrambling for secure sources. Prices are near all-time highs.

Enter: **West Gore**, with known stockpiles of mineralized antimony-gold material still on site — **never assayed or quantified.**

🔹 **Premier-Backed Exploration**  
Nova Scotia’s Premier, **Tim Houston**, has made critical minerals a priority.  
Permitting is streamlined. Exploration is encouraged. Mining bans lifted.

Perfect timing for MILIF to revive this forgotten but strategic asset.

🔹 **The 2025 Game Plan**  
📂 Historic data review  
🛰️ Drone magnetics  
🎯 Drill target delineation

Previous drilling shows open strike and depth potential.

🔹 **Geology Snapshot**  
The system includes **stibnite, native antimony, aurostibnite**, and **Au-Sb alloys** — hosted in quartz veins cutting the **Meguma gold belt**. Rare and high-value.

🔹 **Immediate and Long-Term Upside**  
The **stockpiles** alone could offer near-term revenue potential.  
But the big prize is underground: confirming and expanding a **high-grade antimony-gold system** in a world hungry for secure critical mineral supply.

💥 **Exit Strategy?**  
This type of strategic asset could easily attract interest from buyers like $**UAMY**, who need stable, Western supply. A takeout isn’t off the table if MILIF delivers.

🪙 Strategic location  
📈 Modern exploration  
🧭 Historical production

Keep your eye on **$MILIF** — this could be one of the most important antimony projects in North America as the critical mineral race intensifies.
You know, at first glance I really thought the ticket was MILF and I thought “hey why not?” So they have only got the right to surface access. How long will it take to have the earliest pea, bulk sample test and actual production? How much cash could this stockpile bring in!? Could be a massive sleeper. Looking to enter just need to do more dd post positions numb nuts The sale of the stock piles to $UAMY would be huge. 

https://preview.redd.it/6cppi2wrex4f1.png?width=560&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6c843249e6cf543c8315adcb0a9925077031cf5 Huge milestone for the company. Western world needs more antimony pronto Yeah but Orange Felon doesn't want to trade with Canada nor do they need anything we have....so fucking stupid.  He would rather get the precious metals from China apparently. For those down voting me, check Trump's social posts today FFS.....

**PS:** Der Aktienkurs steht aktuell bei CAD 0,015 und hatte aufgrund mangelnder Geduld der Trader stark gelitten.

Die kontinuierlichen Fortschritte und die soliden Fundamentaldaten von Tradewind könnten jedoch eine Chance für diejenigen bieten, die bereit sind, über die aktuelle Stimmung hinauszublicken.

1l2bnjm,2025-06-03,"Americas Gold Lands Massive $100M Financing Deal Plus Premium Equity Investment for Silver Mine Growth
06/03/2025 - 07:00 AM

TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Americas Gold and Silver Corporation (TSX: USA) (NYSE American: [USAS](https://www.stocktitan.net/overview/USAS)) (“Americas” or the “Company”), a growing North American precious metals producer, is pleased to announce that it has arranged a US$100 million of senior secured debt facility (""Term Loan Facility”) to be provided by a third party to be used primarily to fund growth and development capital spending at the Galena Complex. The US$100 million Term Loan Facility consists of three tranches: a term loan with proceeds of US$50 million that will be advanced at closing, and two additional tranches of US$25 million.

Americas is also pleased to announce it has entered into an offtake agreement (the “Offtake Agreement”) with Ocean Partners USAInc. (“Ocean Partners”) for treatment of up to 100% of the concentrates from the Company’s Galena Complex at Teck Resources Limited’s (“Teck”) Trail Operations in Trail British Columbia, one of the world’s largest fully-integrated zinc, lead and critical metals complexes. As a condition to closing the Term Loan Facility and in conjunction with the Offtake Agreement, Ocean Partners will subscribe for 16.8 million common shares in the Company at C$0.95 per common share, representing a premium of approximately 14% to the USA 20-day VWAP for gross proceeds of US$11.5 million (the “Private Placement”).

**Paul Andre Huet, Chairman and CEO, commented:** “Today’s announcement represents a major milestone for Americas Gold and Silver shareholders. The culmination of months of work, the $100 million in non-dilutive debt financing will allow us to both aggressively pursue our capital development spending at the Galena Complex and further strengthen our balance sheet. The debt financing is critical to our major growth plans at Galena which include the reintroduction of Long Hole Stoping and associated underground development, continued major equipment purchases and upgrades to the No. 3 shaft. The projects to be executed are driven by the results of our materials handling trade off studies completed over the course of the year to date, all focused on boosting productivity underground and efficiency in our hoisting schedules. Alongside our lender, we carefully structured the Term Loan Facility into three tranches to match the pace of our capital plans over the growth period.

Regarding our future offtake strategy, I am very pleased to have closed a strong agreement at very competitive terms with Ocean Partners for treatment of up to 100% the precious and base metals concentrate produced from our Galena Complex at Teck’s Trail Operations. The Agreement reinforces a robust strategic relationship to recover a wide variety of metals from the polymetallic concentrates produced at our operations at a world class facility in close geographic proximity to our operations. Guaranteeing processing capacity at a nearby smelter is critical as the Company executes its plans to significantly increase silver and by-product metal production over the next several years.

We are also very encouraged that as part of the Agreement, Ocean Partners have elected to satisfy the Term Loan Facility pre-financing condition via an US$11.5 million equity investment into Americas at a significant 14% premium to our share price. This investment by Ocean Partners is a testament to their confidence in our growth initiatives and further aligns us in our overarching corporate objective of building shareholder value. The proceeds of the equity investment will be used immediately to continue the strong momentum of our impactful work underway at Galena.

Overall, our growth strategy is firmly on track with a robust balance sheet and available cash to underpin the capital investment required to unlock the full potential of the Galena Complex.

1l1hyvu,2025-06-02,"Strategic leadership and operational turnaround $INGN
Inogen has undergone significant leadership changes aimed at revitalizing its operations. The new management team has implemented strategies focusing on cost reduction and operational efficiency. This is evident in the company's improved financial performance:

Operating Loss Reduction: In 2024, Inogen's operating loss decreased to $42.5 million from $109.4 million in 2023, marking a 61% improvement.

Gross Margin Expansion: The gross margin improved to 46.1% in 2024, up from 40.1% in 2023, driven by lower raw material costs and operational efficiencies.

These improvements indicate that the new management's initiatives are yielding positive results, setting the stage for potential profitability.

Robust Financial Position:

Inogen's financial health is a cornerstone of its investment appeal:

Strong Cash Reserves: As of December 31, 2024, the company held $117.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, with no debt outstanding.

Market Capitalization: With a market cap of approximately $175.57 million, the company's cash reserves represent a significant portion of its valuation, suggesting limited downside risk.

This strong balance sheet provides Inogen with the flexibility to invest in growth initiatives and weather economic uncertainties.

Inogen is actively working to revitalize its DTC segment through strategic initiatives:

Patient-First Approach: The company is focusing on enhancing the customer experience, aiming to increase rental patient acquisition and retention.

Operational Enhancements: Efforts to improve the efficiency of the DTC channel are underway, which may lead to better margins and customer satisfaction.

These initiatives are expected to contribute to long-term growth in the DTC segment.

While direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales have faced challenges, Inogen's B2B segment has shown robust growth: Inogen, Inc.

Revenue Increase: In Q4 2024, total revenue increased by 5.5% year-over-year to $80.1 million, primarily driven by higher demand and new customers in international and domestic B2B sales.

International Expansion: International B2B revenue grew by 31.5% in Q4 2024 compared to the prior year, indicating successful penetration into new markets.

The strength in B2B channels provides a stable revenue stream and offsets the volatility in DTC sales.

Lastly Favorable Valuation Metrics:

Inogen's current valuation presents an attractive entry point for investors:

Enterprise Value: The company's enterprise value stands at approximately $75.22 million, significantly lower than its market cap, reflecting its substantial cash holdings.

Price-to-Sales Ratio: With 2024 revenues of $335.7 million, the price-to-sales ratio is around 0.52x, indicating that the stock is undervalued relative to its sales.

**Operator**

Thank you for standing by. This is the conference operator. Welcome to the NexGen Energy First Quarter 2025 Results Conference Call. As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. \[Operator Instructions\] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Leigh Curyer, Chief Executive Officer and Director with NexGen Energy Limited. Please go ahead, sir.

**Leigh Curyer**

Much appreciated, Kaitlyn. Thank you all for joining us today for NexGen's Q1 2025 financial results conference call. I am Leigh Curyer, Chief Executive Officer of NexGen Energy. And I'm joined today by my colleagues Travis McPherson, Chief Commercial Officer; and Benjamin Salter, Chief Financial Officer.

Over the course of today's call, I will provide a brief update on the global uranium market landscape which has seen a continuation of historically unprecedented demand combined with sustained fragility of supply. Further, liquidity returning to the spot market in the latter part of the quarter, elevating spot at 11%. I'll also provide an overview of our key accomplishments during the first quarter of 2025. This includes our continued advancement through the regulatory process for our Rook I project as we prepare for the upcoming Canadian Safety Commission hearings later this year. In addition, an update on our exciting 2025 drilling program at Patterson Corridor East.

The early results from our drilling program are simply excellent, including what is now recognized as the best ever discovery phase intercept in RK-25-232 on our land package as reported on March 24, 2025. It all adds up to NexGen's Rook I project on the cusp of final federal permitting and on completion, then immediately entering into construction. Followed by production at the time, the market for uranium is going to be intense for low-risk, stable production sources from sound jurisdictions. NexGen's Rook I project will return Canada back to being the world leader in the production of uranium, incorporating the most elite environmental, social and governance practices. In parallel, throughout all of this, further drilling at PCE, defining mineralization, which is exhibiting all the famous and unique high-grade solid technical setting attributes of its neighbor, Arrow, 3.5 kilometers to the west.

At the conclusion of this presentation, we'll move to the Q&A to give you the opportunity to ask Travis, Ben and myself any questions you'd like to ask. Throughout the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements. I invite you to visit our website for all the relevant disclaimers.

As we begin, it's important to acknowledge the pivotal inflection point we're at. The uranium investment thesis has evolved from promise to reality with the key focus turning to execution and scarcity. What we have experienced in uranium equity since the start of the year is a real disconnect from the fundamentals. It's fair to say the noise around tariffs have reflected attention of key uranium market fundamentals materializing.

With over 30 countries committed to tripling their nuclear energy capacity by 2050 and more than 60 reactors currently under construction globally. So, robustness and the sustainability of demand is at unprecedented levels for nuclear power. Canada has a leading role to play, particularly considering its Southern neighbor, the United States of America is realizing its security of supply for this key fuel requires substantial investment and projects required to come online now.

The International Atomic Energy Agency's high case scenario predicts cumulative uranium requirements of approximately 7 billion through 2025. The vast majority of these requirements are currently undiscovered and unknown. A project like NexGen's Rook I is unprecedented in terms of the volume capability, the technical, environmental, social and economic performance. Yet our industry would need at least 10 of them over the next 25 years to meet the demand. The sheer scale of the structural deficit underscores the critical nature of the supply challenges facing the world and the scarce and strategic nature of NexGen's role.

Italian market signal has emerged this quarter. Several producers have planned current pricing levels are insufficient and consequently deferred contract decisions while others have delayed final investment decisions on development projects. It is encouraging to see the new generation of uranium developers and to be producers joining NexGen and working collectively to ensure the sustainability of our industry through discipline and patience. This will lead to high uranium prices sustained in the long term, incorporating the real costs of delivering ethically sourced uranium to ensure reliable sustained supply. Pricing must strengthen significantly to incentivize the production growth across the globe, which is required to meet the current and future demand. Demand is resilient. And with the new tech players entering the space, our industry is primed for better outcomes than before, which is in the interest of all participants delivering energy to populations.

Spot prices currently sit at approximately $71 a pound, having moved swiftly from the low 60s on relatively modest activity in an emerging carry trade opportunity, demonstrating the market's inherent sensitivity to even small changes in liquidity. Meanwhile, the term price has held firm, maintaining levels near $80 a pound. This resilience in long-term pricing sends a strong signal and historically serves as the leading indicator. The demand-centric fundamentals remain exceptionally robust despite short-term volatility.

For NexGen, these developments reflect and validate our strategy. Our initial sales contracts reflect fundamental supply demand imbalance in the uranium market and importantly capture the economics in a rising price environment for our shareholders while providing unparalleled security and diversification of supply to our utility partners. NexGen remains extremely busy negotiating term deals with the industry, and this hasn't been impacted by elections, global trade tension and all the illiquidity in the spot market. It's recognition on NexGen's role in this market in the near future is well understood as evidenced by these ongoing contract negotiations.

The policy landscape continues to evolve in favor of nuclear energy and secure supply chains, particularly noteworthy is the anticipated executive order from the United States to expedite nuclear project development through the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy. This initiative recognizes the convergence of National and NSG Security has been the same in today's electrified world. Baseload power attracts business investment, supports industrial growth and enables advanced technological development in critical areas like artificial intelligence.

Similarly, Europe has recently announced plans to legislate the phaseout of Russian nuclear supplier from its energy ecosystem beginning 2027. This decisive shift away from Russian dependency opens substantial opportunities for Western suppliers and reinforces the premium place on ethical, environmentally responsible production from politically stable jurisdictions.

Further, only yesterday, Germany has signaled a major positive shift back towards nuclear energy. This decision has major positive implications on EU energy policy. Together with Belgium, repealing nuclear phaseout laws, opening the door to new nuclear investment, and the list goes on of additional positive major macro news involving nuclear. It simply reflects the reality of power employments, not only the provision of power, but the reliable, environmentally sensibly sourced to support populations and economies. In exchange, Rook I with its industry-leading environmental profile, technical simplicity, long mine life and location in Saskatchewan, Canada will benefit tremendously from this recalibration of the global supply chain.

Q1 2025 has seen significant company milestones. The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission scheduling our two public hearing dates for the Rook I project set for November 19, 2025, and February 9 to 13, 2026, and we are ready today to present Canada's largest uranium development project to the world. The commission to finalize project approval for the benefit of our shareholders and indigenous nation partners, the province of Saskatchewan, Canada and the planet. These hearing dates provide clarity on the time line and allow us to strategically optimize our construction schedule, advanced procurement initiatives and detailed engineering work and implement our construction hiring plan with precision, positioning us to maximize efficiency once we transition from permitting to construction execution.

We're almost done monitoring Canada's evolving regulatory landscape with its increased focus on streamlining approvals for projects of national significance, and that had provincial approval. That is NexGen. Newly elected Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney has stated, one and done, which is extremely positive and recognize the opportunity Canada has but also his willingness to sensibly streamline the rigorous approval process to actually deliver Canada's economic trade and energy security interests.

Turning to Patterson Corridor East, a region that continues to exceed and indeed, redefine our expectations. In 2025, we launched our most extensive drill program at PCE to date, a 43,000 meter exploration campaign, one of the largest in the Athabasca Basin in this year. The goal is clear, to follow up on the exceptional mineralization encountered to date and better understand the scale and continuity of what is shaping up to be a significant discovery, which exhibits all of those unique attributes of the mighty Arrow deposit.

On March 24, 2025, we reported what is now the best ever discovery phase intercept across any NexGen property. Drill hole RK-25-232 intersected 3.9 meters of off scale greater than 61,000 counts per second, uranium mineralization within a broader 13.8 meter zone. For additional holes, all at least 50 meters apart from this intercept, return the same intense ultra-high-grade mineralization. The high-grade zones have now doubled in size since our last update, measuring 210 meters along strike and 335 meters vertically, and it remains open in all directions. These are extraordinary results, particularly given that PCE is still in its discovery phase. For comparison, intercepts of this caliber at Arrow didn't emerge until much later during the targeted resource definition phase.

I'd like to remind everyone that NexGen holds the most significant land position, over 190 hectares in Saskatchewan Southwest Athabasca Basin, which is widely considered to be the future of uranium production in the West. PCE is located just 3.5 km east of the world-class Arrow deposit which positions us to significantly expand our resource base in the coming years and positively impact the communities where we operate for many generations to come.

NexGen is exceptionally well capitalized. We hold approximately CAD435 million in cash, enough to fund the start of construction activities for the next 12 to 18 months. In addition, we have over $1.6 billion in expressions of interest from leading banks and export credit agencies to form the base of our project funding. Like any Tier 1 project, we are navigating many financial options to optimize the funding of this project.

In terms of timing, we remain focused on year-end of this -- for year-end 2025 for determining the best financing page that provides certainty of capital, enables us to maintain our marketing strategy and maximizing exposure to the prevailing prices in the future and enables us to maintain our production output flexibility. At the same time, demand for our future production has never been stronger. Offtake negotiations are continuous with a diverse group of counterparties all over the world. We expect to announce additional agreements this year, further bolstering our market position as we move into construction and production. With federal approval approaching, the integrated project team are in place. All procurement and detailed engineering is in place, ready to commence construction with a robust balance sheet. We are ready and exceptionally well positioned to advance into the next phase of development.

With that, I would now like to open the floor to questions.

**Question-and-Answer Session**

**Operator**

\[Operator Instructions\] Our first question is from Ralph Profiti with Stifel. Please go ahead.

**Ralph Profiti**

Good day. Thanks, operator. Leigh, I'd like to ask a question on more detailed progress towards procurement of equipment and long lead items. Are you happy with where you are in the queue? And are your suppliers talking about general inflationary pressures or delivery schedules that may be at risk? Or are these conversations in line with expectations?

**Leigh Curyer**

Thanks, Ralph. Look, we have a very detailed construction execution plan, which is down to the day once we have approval. And so one of the benefits of -- round about benefit of the commission hearing date being set for November 2025 and February 2026 is that it does allow us to plan exceptionally well that procurement process with respect to the key inputs, particularly around the first 12 to 18 months of construction. As I speak, that is well in hand. And it is a significant focus of the executive team's time is on that execution plan. And as I speak, I'm very comfortable where that's heading. In terms of pricing, look, the industry broadly is always under pricing pressure. We're not excluded from that. But we are maintaining what we expect things to cost as we've previously forecasted. And that's also been supported by due diligence by a number of the debt and equity providers that have been running a process on our project. The good thing about the Rook I Arrow project is that the economics are extraordinarily robust. So if there is CPI pressure, it won't be as material as you would see in a marginal project. Further, with the payback period being so short, approximately 13 months at current prices, the impact of any CPI increase on the financeability of the project will also be immaterial. So, it's something you're quite right, Ralph. It is an aspect we place a lot of attention on and planning. And it's -- as we speak, we're in shape, and I continue to be -- I wouldn't see any changes in that either going forward, considering the amount of detailed planning that's gone into the construction execution schedule.

**Ralph Profiti**

Great. Thanks for that answer, Leigh. And a separate question, as greater attention turns to exploration, just wondering how you're balancing the desire to turn around the mineral resource estimate inaugural one for PCE and basically what the drills are telling you, which is the longer you take, the more potential is, just wondering how you're balancing those two aspects of potential versus delivering an MRE?

**Leigh Curyer**

Yeah, sure. So firstly, it's the exploration group. And so this doesn't, at any way, dilute the attention on the final federal permitting or the execution schedule. But with respect to the exploration group, I must stress, PCE is still in a definition like what are we dealing with stage. I don't see us turning to delineation, resource definition and drilling activities. As we speak at the earliest, that would be 2026. They're still -- it's still open in every direction. It's looking better than what Arrow did at the same stage of drilling. And as we all know, Arrow expanded considerably once we take into the high-grade sub-domain. So it's very, very early in the stages. We're under no -- we don't see if there's pressure. We have a very well-thought-out exploration approach where we look to define what is the area of mineralization first, where we tag into a high-grade sub-domain, we then focus a little more weighting of the drill bits towards that because the consequence of intersecting that high-grade intense mineralization does have an extremely material impact on the resource definition. Once we get a sense that we've got both of those understood, that's when we'll then shift that attention to that -- like a measurement in terms of volume and grade, but not beforehand. And I don't see us being anywhere near that stage at that as we speak. And look, that's exciting news for everyone. It's way too early to determine just exactly what we're dealing with that PCE because it's exhibiting just incredible similar characteristics to what Arrow is.

**Ralph Profiti**

Thanks very much, Leigh. I appreciate those answers.

**Leigh Curyer**

Thanks, Ralph.

**Operator**

The next question is from Julio Mondragon with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

**Julio Mondragon**

Hi, good morning, Leigh. Julio here. So just the first question is related to your plans for Rook I development for this year. So, the budget on potential activities, well, as you await the hearing date later this year and early 2026.

**Leigh Curyer**

Yeah. If I've understood the question, Julio, yeah, the hearing date, we're ready right now, as we speak. If we had approvals as we speak, we would be already in construction. We've had a very clear definition around what we're building and how we're going to build it since 2017, and we've been refining it ever since. So, this project has had an extraordinary amount of time and focus on executing it well. When you add into that, the fact that it's very simple technically relative to other mines around the world, it's an extremely confident basement rock. It's actually a very small physical footprint and a very small mine. We'll be removing about 1.5 double deck of buses of ore a day. That is tiny for a mine. And then we have the very clean metallurgy, so the processing plant itself in a relative sense is a more straightforward, simplified version of what we've seen in other parts of the world. That all bodes well for once we have the approval to execute well. And from a company perspective and mindset, and as everyone knows, we're very, very diligent on risk analysis. We are looking forward to construction because of the amount of time and energy that we've put into it over the last -- it's almost eight years. And we have the team in place, and we have the execution schedule down to the day. So, we can't wait to be in that position, and we expect so in early 2026 at the conclusion of the federal permitting process with the CNSC.

**Julio Mondragon**

Thank you. So just to understand a little bit more in the near-term, what will be your development activities for 2025 and what will be the budget -- potential budget for these activities if I may ask?

**Leigh Curyer**

Yeah. So, look, we're all focused on exploration in 2026 and -- sorry, in 2025 and we maintain that site on an exploration basis to support the regional drilling activities and maintaining that in an environmentally elite manner. So once we have CAD435 million in the treasury as we speak, we have also liquid assets of around another CAD300 million on top of that. Once we're in construction, that's when you'll see an acceleration of the budget. But as we speak, we are well funded well into the back end of 2026 to meet all of our general and administrative expenses, maintaining the site in readiness for construction as well and supporting exploration activities.

**Julio Mondragon**

Perfect. Thank you very much. So, if I may ask one more question, how are your contracting discussions with utilities going at the moment? If we can have more detail on that? Thank you.

**Leigh Curyer**

Sure. I might just hand over to Travis on that one.

**Travis McPherson**

Yeah, perfect. Travis here, and thanks for the question. Yeah, as Leigh alluded to in his remarks at the beginning here, contracting discussions have been very, very robust, ongoing lots of them, and you can expect to see more contracts get signed and announced shortly and throughout the year. I think general context and color around it, is definitely a growing awareness of the acute nature of the supply deficit and particularly later this decade and into the 2030s when Arrow is going to be producing. People are very -- utilities, in particular, are very, very concerned about that period of time and rightfully so. So that obviously positions NexGen well and very uniquely. And the utilities are also understanding that not all uranium is created equal and buying uranium from us represents a different value proposition to them than buying uranium from an incumbent producer because it's not -- an incumbent producer isn't offering them net new diversification and new supply sources, whereas support for our mine and all the other emerging developers offers them that. And so there's a recognition of that, which is very supportive to ours, and I'm sure other developers’ initiatives. So yeah, very, very good and robust and more to come on that front.

**Julio Mondragon**

Perfect. Thank you very much, Travis and Leigh. Thanks.

**Operator**

The next question is from Andrew Wong with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

**Andrew Wong**

Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just on contracting again, can you just talk a little bit terms of the contracts that are being discussed? For NexGen, my understanding, you guys would prefer more spot-related market exposure? Is that where we can expect to see your upcoming contract settlements? Are the utilities agreeing to that? Just any sense on if there are any floors or ceilings that are being discussed, what's those levels are today?

**Travis McPherson**

Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. It's Travis again. We obviously can't talk about specific terms. What I would say is that what we disclosed in December for those initial 5 million pounds of contracts where we outlined kind of what the sensitivities look like and stuff that's in line with what we're assessing going forward and our focus on maximizing the exposure to the future prevailing price of uranium. Spot price of uranium at the time we deliver uranium is -- it remains consistent and definitely willingness of utilities and our standing of utilities, generally speaking, to our desire for that and how it benefits both us and them actually in the sense that our philosophy overall is not just one where it only benefits us, it benefits utilities and that you don't get into a post-Fukushima world again, where producers are oversupplying a market to way, way too long because they have floor prices that incentivize them to breakeven and contractually obligate them to continue to produce. Our philosophy and our strategy around marketing eliminates that because we shorten the duration of the contracts and tie them to the price at the time. And therefore, if something changes in the future, the industry can adjust or at least we can in these contracts. So that understanding is there, and yes, they're open to that as we demonstrated in December with the disclosure.

**Leigh Curyer**

Yeah. And, Andrew, I'll just add to the fact that, yes, utilities don't do the same contract with -- to Travis' earlier point, utilities don't do the same contract for all producers or advanced developers. The contracts do reflect the unique nature of our respective projects. Now, our strategy merely reflects the technical aspects, economic aspects and environmental aspects of our project. We're in confident basement rock. We can ramp production up, we can ramp production down, given market conditions. And that is to the benefit of the producers, but also the utilities who are procuring the offtake. So I know there's a bit of commentary out there that it only works this way, and that's the way it's always worked. But this mine -- there's never been a mine like this in terms of technical certainty, economics and environmental performance. And our contracting strategy merely reflects those attributes. And that is what has been appreciated by the utilities that we have already contracted with and we'll contract with in the near-term.

**Andrew Wong**

That’s a lot of great color. Thank you. With the federal election, I'm curious how has that impacted your discussions with the governmental on approvals? Have you had any discussions with the new government since the election? And is there any flex around those public hearing dates?

**Leigh Curyer**

Look, the good thing about those dates that are now bookends, and we know and they're in place. Look, I've been incredibly encouraged by Mark Carney's comments with respect to one and done for major energy projects in Canada. And if that transpires into a more efficient regulatory process where a project that has provincial approval won't require a subsequent federal approval, I think that's in the interest of all current but also future uranium projects that are going into production. Look, there is aspects of having two regulatory both the provincial and federal. There is overlap and between the two, that's not in anyone's interest. And so look, I've been very impressed with Mark Carney's commitment to streamlining the process. And Canada playing to its strengths and getting these energy projects up and running now. So if it does transpire into that, I'll be very, very pleased to present that. Certainly, the Premier of Saskatchewan, Scott Moe has been very public with the receptor, what he would like to see with respect to the federal government's approach to projects such as ours. Yeah, let's wait and see. Look, November will be just around the corner. No doubt about that. And we are in the final stages as we speak.

**Andrew Wong**

Great. Thank you very much.

**Operator**

\[Operator Instructions\] Our next question is from Craig Hutchison with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.

**Craig Hutchison**

Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just a question. You mentioned at the onset that you're looking to find out the best financing package by year end. Are you guys still entertaining a strategic investor at the asset level at this point?

**Leigh Curyer**

Yeah. I’ll -- Travis, he can answer that.

**Travis McPherson**

Yeah. Thanks, Leigh. Yeah, Craig, short answer, yes, we are. As we have talked about in the past, it's very targeted select group that we have been engaging with some over the last two years, some in detail over the last year. And yeah, it still remains one of the many options that we have at hand. In terms of timing, everyone involved on that process, on the prepayment process, on the debt process are all lining up for the timing around year-end of this year as we noticed.

**Craig Hutchison**

Okay. So that would come before the permits probably?

**Leigh Curyer**

Yeah. potentially. But obviously, the permits are very dependent on including that financing aspect.

**Craig Hutchison**

And just on the contracting, I mean, do you guys have a sort of set volume or rough volume that you want to have contracted before you make the final investment decision?

**Travis McPherson**

Yeah, Craig. No, we don't have that. Some of the options will require some level of offtake being in place, but it won't be in place to commence construction. If the debt is, an example, there's a portion of it that requires some volumes to be demonstrated, then as we talked about before, they don't need price hedging, in that sense they don't use -- the lenders don't care what pricing mechanism is utilized. But there'll need to be some volumes there, but those are needed until the first part of those won't be needed to tell you to actually start to draw down the debt, which won't be until early in 2027 at a minimum. So -- and then others, it's not part of the discussion. So, there is no volume that we need to get to start construction. As we've said, we're ready to go. If we got approval tomorrow, we're in construction immediately. So yeah, in a good position there. And then even longer term, we don't really have the -- because we get asked this sometimes like what's the split of term contracts or whatever. Long term, we don't have a set percentage that we want. We've always maintained our ability to leverage the production output flexibility that the mine has, and then the biggest determinant really is just the alignment between ourselves and the counterparty that we're dealing with. Our counterparties that we're dealing with, with respect to what the future of the uranium supply and demand looks like. And if there's alignment then we can get there on a contract. If there's no alignment, then that's when we're patient. And we've been patient the whole time, and that's clearly benefited us materially to do that, and we'll continue to do that.

**Craig Hutchison**

Okay, great. Maybe one last question for me. Just back to PCE. I think the expectation was assays were released in April. Would it take a bit longer than expected? Or are you guys just waiting to batch those results with some new ones?

**Leigh Curyer**

No. The lab has been very, very busy with given the volume of what's gone through, they will -- we're expecting them, imminently, Craig. And when we release, we always provide materiality context around it. So yeah, there's no doubt, 232 will have its own news release, given its materiality which will most likely be separate from the assay results from the drilling that occurred in 2024. I just would emphasize again, like, we are still in the very early stages of getting a grasp on the scope of PCE, but it's looking extremely strong if you provide relativity to Arrow at the same level of drilling.

**Craig Hutchison**

Great. Good luck, guys. Thanks.

**Operator**

The next question is from Brian MacArthur with Raymond James. Please go ahead.

**Brian MacArthur**

Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. A little bit back to what Ralph was talking about. When you get approval, let's just say we get it February next year, I mean, are you going to be able to do anything to move the whole construction timeframe up? If you can maybe just go through how you see it developing going forward on the timeline and where the critical path is to production once you do get your permits.

**Leigh Curyer**

Yeah. Thanks, Brian. Look, the shaft is, effectively, the longest lead time item. Requires the greatest amount of preparation as well. As for the feasibility study that we updated in August of 2024, it is a four-year construction process. It's preferable to start either as you're coming out of the winter, which is around the time that we expect the conclusion of this CNSC hearing process. So I think everyone should adjust that from the commencement construction, which is subject to CNSC finalizing the process, it is a 48-month process from that date. So I don't want to -- there's not -- in terms of accelerating that 48 months, there's nothing really material. It's going to be 48 months.

**Brian MacArthur**

Great. Thanks. I think that’s how I understood it too. On the converse, just to be sure, there's nothing because it's delayed back to Ralph's question that you've lost stuff in the queues, is there anything that would make it longer than 48 months that you can see right now just because of the timing of the way things have worked out.

**Leigh Curyer**

No, it's actually the opposite, this -- the delay in the hearings allows us to really refine the execution schedule for key imports even further out than what we otherwise would have. So, everyone -- that's a reduction in execution risk once we start construction due to this delay in the hearings to November of '25 and February of 2026. So, it's actually from the execution perspective, when you do commence, it's actually a little positive.

**Brian MacArthur**

Great. Thanks. And maybe just one more thing to make sure I fully understand this. My understanding was a lot of the sourcing was in Canada for what you need as well. Is that right? So really, there's not a whole lot of risk in the supply chain going forward? Is that a fair comment?

**Leigh Curyer**

That's fair. And we will prioritize and optimize the opportunities for Canada first and foremost. There is some specialization of certain items of equipment with respect to the shaft and the mill, but nothing really material in that sense that Canada will be prioritized. And I will say that, that prioritization does, as everyone knows, with respect to our focus on local communities, it will start in the local communities and expand out from there.

**Brian MacArthur**

Great. Thanks very much, Leigh. That’s very clear.

**Leigh Curyer**

Thanks, Brian.

**Operator**

This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Curyer for any closing remarks.

**Leigh Curyer**

Thank you, Kaitlyn. Yes, as always, we really appreciate everyone's ongoing interest and support for NexGen. As I alluded to in the earlier part of the call, we are on the cusp of final federal permitting approval. The market and the fundamentals for nuclear energy are improving almost on a daily basis with all of the news that is coming out. And NexGen is ready to deliver its role in returning Canada to being the number one producer of this incredibly important fuel that powers the economies and the population's homes right around the world. With that, I thank everyone for their time and attention. And as always, if any additional questions arise, please don't hesitate to reach out to Monica, Stacey, Travis or myself. Thank you.

require level offtake place wont place commence construction debt example theres portion requires volumes demonstrated talked dont need price hedging sense dont use lenders dont care pricing mechanism utilized therell need volumes needed first part wont needed tell actually start draw debt wont early 2027 minimum others part discussion volume need get start construction weve said ready go got approval tomorrow construction immediately yeah good position even longer term dont really get asked sometimes like whats split term contracts whatever long term dont set percentage want weve always maintained ability leverage production output flexibility mine biggest determinant really alignment counterparty dealing counterparties dealing respect future uranium supply demand looks like theres alignment get contract theres alignment thats patient weve patient whole time thats clearly benefited us materially well continue craig hutchison okay great maybe one last question back pce think expectation assays released april would take bit longer expected guys waiting batch results new ones leigh curyer lab busy given volume whats gone expecting imminently craig release always provide materiality context around yeah theres doubt 232 news release given materiality likely separate assay results drilling occurred 2024 would emphasize like still early stages getting grasp scope pce looking extremely strong provide relativity arrow level drilling craig hutchison great good luck guys thanks operator next question brian macarthur raymond james please go ahead brian macarthur good

1l11v9t,2025-06-01,"iPhone Air (Claimed by Leaker) LiquidMetal?
This is claimed as an actual iPhone Air video, but of course, there is no way of knowing if it’s real. Still, what other material other than LiquidMetal has this kind of spring back, especially in a thin design like this. See the X video below.

https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1925906968159392029

LiquidMetal, a US company, has a long history with Apple, and Ming recently wrote that Apple is using LiquidMetal in the rumored iPhone fold. Could they also be using it in the rumored iPhone Air? Also, Professor Lugee Li was recently named to manage the operations of Liquidmetal Asia Holdings Ltd (“LMAH”), LiquidMetal’s wholly-owned Hong Kong-based subsidiary. Why is a $260K manager needed there?

Does this seem like a penny stock about to break out?
The video shown on x is a prototype.  All iPhone prototypes are made entirely out if metal with no internal components.  It is a literal brick of metal in the video.

Could LiquidMetal be involved?  Sure.  But that's not why that phone in the video was so durable. Depending on the metal used, and how strong said person is, yeah it could.  I mean, Samsung already has the s25 edge out.  And it's paper thin, and durable.  But not as durable as I would like a phone that is that thin.  This is why I have little hope about the iphone fold.  Samsung has been trying to perfect foldable screens for years and they still break after (roughly) 1500 open/closes. Yeah, I don’t know. I just noticed the spring back. Would a solid block of metal bend and spring back like that? This is a disease and all these benders need to be inside a padded room. Yes it absolutely can. Metal can have ‘memory’ and return to the form it was cast or heat treated in. There is nothing remarkable about a metal spring to you is there? That’s the exact principle you are asking about. There are plenty of metal springs thicker than that phone blank too LiquidMetal is the answer - at least I hope so. Apple’s been playing with LiquidMetal long enough - time to use it! With Ming writing that they’ll use LiquidMetal in the hinge, it’s not too big a jump to think about them using it for this very thin frame in the iPhone Air - if that’s a real product. Also, with Professor Lugee Li managing the LiquidMetal wholly-owned Hong Kong subsidiary Liquidmetal Asia Holdings Ltd, they are gearing up for something.",5,0.61,6,0,DMN_LQMT,pennystocks,['META'],iphone air claimed leaker liquidmetal claimed actual iphone air video course way knowing real still material liquidmetal kind spring back especially thin design like see x video liquidmetal us company long history apple ming recently wrote apple using liquidmetal rumored iphone fold could also using rumored iphone air also professor lugee li recently named manage operations liquidmetal asia holdings ltd lmah liquidmetals whollyowned hong kongbased subsidiary 260k manager needed seem like penny stock break video shown x prototype iphone prototypes made entirely metal internal components literal brick metal video could liquidmetal involved sure thats phone video durable depending metal used strong said person yeah could mean samsung already s25 edge paper thin durable durable would like phone thin little hope iphone fold samsung trying perfect foldable screens years still break roughly 1500 opencloses yeah dont know noticed spring back would solid block metal bend spring back like disease benders need inside padded room yes absolutely metal memory return form cast heat treated nothing remarkable metal spring thats exact principle asking plenty metal springs thicker phone blank liquidmetal answer least hope apples playing liquidmetal long enough time use ming writing theyll use liquidmetal hinge big jump think using thin frame iphone air thats real product also professor lugee li managing liquidmetal whollyowned hong kong subsidiary liquidmetal asia holdings ltd gearing something
1l0vsa9,2025-06-01,"Noodles & Company (NDLS) - Yes, NDLS is currently considered a penny stock
I find this an interesting investment and in a space I have little to no experience in. I look at a company that has 450+ restaurants across 31 U.S. States and say how is their market cap less then 100 million, let alone closer to 40 million. Then I go oh yeah, they are trying to push carbs and the menu has been old. I do not necessarily think this is a blockbuster - Netflix moment for them though.  I have been watching it for a while and recently noticed a change in my food recently. I go and google it and sure enough,

""On March 12, 2025, the company launched its most extensive menu transformation in nearly 30 years, updating approximately two-thirds of its offerings. This revamp introduced new dishes like Buffalo Chicken Ranch Mac & Cheese and Cajun Shrimp Fettuccine, and enhanced existing favorites with premium ingredients such as 18-month aged Parmesan and roasted cherry tomatoes . The changes aim to provide more flavorful, visually appealing options that resonate with evolving customer preferences.""

I know my wife enjoys Noodles & Company, just curious if you have tried there new menu and if it is actually appealing to you?  It would break my heart of they threw away the structure/scale they have built. How can they not find something of value to push through their locations?  When that happens, how fast can they pull a turn around... they have already scaled?

I think going to start scooping some up, not a serious amount, but just think their is so much potential and this price point of sub $1 per share currently is a bargain.... assuming they will be able to turn the ship before it sinks. 

  
Just for comparison, the best thing I could find is Potbelly Corp (PBPB). Similar Scale, closer to 400 restaurants and have a current market cap of \~325 million. NDLS is currently closer to a \~40 million market cap, with over 450 restaurants. There is potential, if they can get the menu/service right.
They missed their EPS essentially by 100%, so this is an $0.80 stock that loses $0.20 a quarter. 


I'm going to assume people buying this are financially illiterate and just give the advice that you should not buy this until they demonstrate any sort of positive performance. I'm almost positive that if Noodles is about to go bankrupt, they will be bought. They have a lot of infrastructure that I think a place like fazolies or something would love.

Maybe Olive Garden makes them their flagship fast-food options? That could push OG into the modern era. The stock market is not an economic indicator Restaurants might not be the best bet with the upcoming recession. People will be less likely to go out to eat. I just heard an ad for OG that said they're delivering now. Seems like they are turning themselves into a fast food restaurant. Yes, but I think they'd love to have satellite producers if it takes off. If they're moving more toward fast Italian they won't want those gigantic ass storefronts Net income was down last quarter, by almost fifty percent.  Problem is no one wants to sit down for a meal.  Chipotle, McDonald's all of them specialize in fast and GTFO.  If they were to drop PR focusing on to go orders etc I would definitely be in. the menu is too carb-y and unhealthy, but good news! huge menu revamp! buffalo ranch mac and cheese!

1l079bi,2025-05-31,"$GLMD working on a GLP-1 drug (i.e. Ozempic, Wegovy) that could be a game changer!
On April 28, Galmed Pharmaceuticals **($GLMD)**, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company for cardiometabolic diseases and GI oncological indications announced that it has signed a binding term-sheet with Entomus s.r.o. for a license agreement for the development and commercialization of a proprietary Self-Emulsifying Drug Delivery System (SEDDS) formulation that allows absorption of sublingually administrated peptides such as GLP-1 (Semaglutide, Liraglutide etc.).

What separates their GLP-1 drug from others (i.e. Ozempic, Wegovy, Rybelsus, etc.) is the that it provides a non-invasive route that allows the medication to directly enter the bloodstream through the **oral mucous membranes** rather than oral or injectable medicines. This means it will be dissolvable in the mouth (under the tongue etc.) and enter directly into the blood stream bypassing the digestive system and liver.

Oral medications (i.e. Rybelsus) often face the challenge of the first-pass effect, where a significant portion of the drug is metabolized in the liver before reaching systemic circulation, potentially reducing its efficacy. Injectable medications (i.e. Ozempic, Wegovy), while bypassing the gastrointestinal tract, can cause discomfort, needless anxiety, and inconvenience for many patients. So sublingual administration with a drug of this caliber can be a game changer. 

In 2024, Ozempic generated approximately **$17 billion** in revenue, while Wegovy generated about **$8 billion** and Rybelsus around **$3.4 billion.** This drug potentially opens **$GLMD** up to a massive billion-dollar market and is currently sitting at a **$6.7 million** market cap. 

With a new formula providing a non-invasive route that allows the medication to enter the bloodstream through the oral mucous membranes, this can be a game changer in medicine for Type 2 Diabetes and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). 

**The company is considering the FDA's 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway to potentially expedite the approval process.**

With the signing of a binding term-sheet with Entomus s.r.o., a definitive agreement determining, among other things, the milestones payments and future royalty payments is expected to be executed within the next 60 days. This initiative represents a strategic expansion for **$GLMD**, traditionally focused on liver and metabolic diseases, into the rapidly growing GLP-1 therapeutics market, which is **projected to exceed $120 billion globally by 2030.**
