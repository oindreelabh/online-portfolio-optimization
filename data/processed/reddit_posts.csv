1lmq88z,2025-06-28,"Trump’s shortlist to replace Fed Chair Powell
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/a-look-at-who-could-replace-powell-as-fed-chair-080004505.html

Trump’s shortlist to replace Fed Chair Powell includes Kevin Warsh, Chris Waller, Scott Bessent, David Malpass, and Kevin Hassett. 

Warsh, a former Fed governor, is seen as hawkish on inflation, his selection could push bond yields higher and weigh on equities due to tighter policy fears. 

Waller, already on the Fed board, supports looking through tariff-driven inflation and wants lower rates, which could lift stocks and lower yields. 

Treasury Secretary Bessent favors pro-growth policies, deregulation, and tax cuts; markets may see his pick as bullish for stocks with upward pressure on long-term yields. 

Malpass argues rates should be lower now; his appointment could spark a risk-on rally and push bond yields down. 

Hassett wants immediate cuts, calling current rates too high , if chosen, stocks could jump while bond markets may price in a faster easing cycle. 

An early Powell replacement may signal Trump’s push for looser policy ahead of 2026.

1lmog1c,2025-06-28,"Inflation is the only way right?
Most populations are decreasing.

The dollar is losing its value.  Government reliability is low.  The only way for the stock market to grow is inflation.

With that said, we are in for a bad ride economically. Please prove me wrong.
Advancement is the only way.  The current market is based on continual improvement.  For example, if you can cut the cost of making a shovel in half, you can lower prices and improve profit margins.  This has been the primary driver for stocks for the last hundred years.  Well, up until probably 2008 when things started to shift.

  
Now, it's about eking out what little money you can from a dwindling middle class.  We're only going to be in a bad ride economically if we continue to concentrate wealth at the top and starve out the middle class.  

  
The issue is less the number of people in the middle class, but more the number of dollars in the middle class.  Once that grinds to a halt, the current system will have to be ""reworked"".  How that will look is anyone's guess, but my money is not on pleasant. No.

Prove me wrong. Please provide evidence for your claims. I was thinking about that the other day though, and despite the stock market making crazy gains the last 10 years, it feels from a consumer perspective like tech advancement has stagnated. AI is the new buzzword, but look at most consumer electronics today compared to 10 years ago, they are faster sure, but fundamentally the same. The is no evolution or revolution or risk taking in tech anymore, just incremental refinement and more and more 'rent seeking' through subscription lock in and 'walled gardens' of major OS or platforms. Problem is middle class can't support this current system when cost of living keeps increasing above wage increases. > makes hopelessly vague and nonsensical assertions


> prove me wrong


Ok let me try something equally useless:

Global population is increasing. Currencies are changing relative value like they have since trade was invented. GDP is growing. The only direction for the stock market to go is up. 

With that said, we’re in for a great ride economically. Please prove me wrong. This.  Most populations aren't declining, his source is his his dumbass brain.  Redditors just saying incorrect shit up confidently again.  Shit gets old, there needs to be a stronger backlash against this kind of thing. Maybe


Prove me wrong The physical object looks similar to how it did 10 years ago. This is true. How it functions under the hood has changed dramatically, however. Embedded systems has undergone a silent revolution that the average person would know nothing about. Well, nothing beyond the extra features and QoL improvements of most of the things they use(and take for granted) on a day to day basis. Inflation is, for sure, going to continue. The thing is, predictable inflation is very easy to account for when making contracts, and so there aren't downsides in productivity or employment losses. 

It's not some disaster. 2% target may become 3 or 4%.

1lmnbep,2025-06-28,"Bullish prospects for medium to Long-term investment into financial stocks.
**Financial stocks, especially Fintech/Traditional Banks, would benefit greatly from these two foreseeable events.**

The Federal Reserve on June 25th approved easing a key capital rule that banks say has limited their ability to operate.  After approving the plan on a 5-2 vote, the Fed board put the proposal open for a 60-day public comment window.

* The measure would call for reducing the top-tier capital that big banks must hold by 1.4% (\~13B) for holding companies. Subsidiaries would see a significantly larger drop of $210 billion, which would still be held by the parent bank. The standard applies the same rules to so-called globally systemic important banks as well as their subsidiaries.
* The rule would lower capital requirements to a range of 3.5% to 4.5% from the current 5%, with subsidiaries put in the same range from a previous level of 6%.
* The plan seeks to loosen up banks to take on more lower-risk inventory such as Treasurys.  Fed regulators essentially are looking for the capital requirements to serve as a safety net rather than a bind on activity.
* The leverage ratio has come under criticism for essentially penalizing banks for holding Treasurys.

On Friday, the president said he wanted interest rates cut to 1% and asked for the resignation of the Fed Chair.

* Powell's term is set to end in May 2026.
* Even if Powell doesn't resign (which he probably won't).  Trump still has more than two and a half years of his presidency term after Powell left.  Trump would certainly hire a Fed Chair who would decrease interest rates drastically, and that would boost financial stocks to higher highs.
The regulations were put there for a reason. Our financial system almost collapsed when the banks made to many bad loans which were packaged and sold as derivatives by Wall Street. It was a complete disaster and if the government hadn’t bailed out some of the big banks it would have been even worse. So no I do not trust bankers to self regulate. 
Lowering interest rates while the economy is still strong combined with tariffs runs a serious risk of very high inflation which pretty much hurts everyone. Which is why politicians should not be trusted to regulate interest rates. The Fed is not flawless but it typically try’s to plan for what is best for the economy long term vs politicians who only think what is best for their own short term benefit. if spending bill gets passed, the market is rocketing Berkshire Hathaway has always been my best source of information on bank stocks. They have been recently selling banks most likely due to the fact that banks generally perform better in a higher interest rate environment. This just happen again a couple years ago with Silicon Valley and first republic banks.

1lmk7s8,2025-06-28,"Thoughts on Cameco CCJ?
Cameco is the world’s second largest uranium producer in the world. But I’m interested in this company because they own 49 percent stake in Westinghouse. Westinghouse is supposed to increase revenue of CCJ by a lot. 

Westinghouse is building 2 power plants in Czech Republic atm and they will be investing around 7 billion in US due to recent trump nuclear bill. All analyst which covered Cameco rate as a buy. Westinghouse is doing a lot of work in Europe. They are pushing to build power plant in Wales too.

Let me know ur thought 
You might want to look into BEP (Brookfield Renewable Partners) LP as well.  They own 51% of Westinghouse.  If you believe in that sector, both are probably solid plays.  I do like the Westinghouse angle your working towards as they will play a key role in this nuclear renaissance we are seeing. Cameco was a buy three years ago. It is a very cyclical company. You’ll do better with an ETF for now. Love 'em, want to buy 'em, too expensive. The whole nuclear sector is tied to the AI bubble... and if you think the AI bubble will pop (which I do), nuclear will pop with it. Once all the hysteria of the bubble is gone, though, I'll happily load up on AI and nuclear. LEU as well moving more What will make it pop thou.

1lmjn24,2025-06-28,"Trump Ends Trade Talks with Canada  Tariffs Incoming? What This Means for Big Tech Stocks
Just saw that Trump officially ended all trade talks with Canada over their digital services tax. He posted that new tariffs are coming “within the next seven days,” and Treasury says they’re prepping a Section 301 investigation  same tool they used on China a few years back

The DST is a 3% tax on digital revenue from Canadian users once a company crosses C$20 million in a year. So naturally this hits companies like Meta, Google, Amazon  and even smaller players like Uber and Etsy. Amazon’s already put out a statement saying they’re disappointed and that this will hurt Canadian consumers, which is probably true because these companies won’t just eat the cost  it’ll get passed on one way or another

Markets didn’t totally freak out, but the Canadian dollar dropped briefly, and the TSX closed slightly down. Cross-border names like GM and Canada Goose took small hits, which makes sense  they’re very trade-sensitive. I imagine this will also hit Canadian ad buyers and retailers pretty directly if tech platforms raise prices in response

Personally I’m wondering how much this really moves the needle for the big tech names. Like sure, $2B in added tax burden sounds big, but spread across giants like AMZN and META, maybe it’s just noise. But if this escalates if tariffs are actually announced next week  then it becomes a bigger deal. Especially with that July 9 deadline coming up for other countries too. Could see short-term volatility spike, especially in sentiment-drive
Not tariffs again… here we go Short lived dip on Monday followed by the usual pump programming. 

Can't have red stocks during America's birthday Most of Europe already charges a digital services tax and most of the rest of the world is in the process of implementing one. I believe some Latin American countries already do as well.

It's an easy concept. Collecting revenue in a country typically results in being taxed. I don't think Canada will fold on it and I don't even really think it's what has made Trump mad.. more likely it's the strategic defence partnership Canada just signed with the EU. Either way it will have practically no impact on US tech. What this means? Absolutely nothing, TACO will prevail. This has nothing to do with the DST so much as it is about Canada implementing policies in conjunction with Europe, who also have a DST. Toss in the fact Europe has been fining the big tech companies and, those companies, are probably getting a bit concerned that outside of the US, governments aren't simply dropping their pants and bending over for them. They are unable to buy country leaders the way they can in the US. 

Like most things, the DST is just a minor issue they can fight over which is symbolic of a much bigger issue. The biggest companies in the world don't want their profits taxed, big shocker. Or it could be the $2.7M in same day expiration put options that were bought just before Trump’s tweet. It’s crazy how many oracles are willing to take such large outlandish bets just before news breaks that causes them to make millions. Please look this up. This 400% tariff on dairy gambit he keeps throwing out is him manipulating his idiotic base into being mad at Canada 

He negotiated and agreed to this 400% tariff back in the USMCA days. It only applies after a certain threshold has been reached, and so far, it has never been passed. If Canada folds on the DST quickly, we might see a relief rally in big tech next week.

1lmctqb,2025-06-28,"Will growth continue to outperform value over the next decade?
We're headed towards an inflection point.

The 4th Industrial Revolution ushered in by AI and anchored by companies like Nvidia.

The number of AI-related companies continue to grow exponentially in the private markets with many coming to the public markets later this year.

The S-curve of technological innovation is at hand.

We're still in the early stages of this S-curve for AI.

It's hard to imagine growth not continuing to dominate value on an relative basis until we are past the inflection point and at the part of the curve of diminishing returns.

This could take another decade.

I understand there are cycles between value and growth, but it appears this growth cycle is much longer than what many have anticipated.

Perhaps we should heed Keynes advice that ""when the facts change, I change my mind.""
Let me check my crystal ball Yes they will outperform until 2091. Value stocks are turds. No one knows, but I’d say it’s very unlikely these mega cap growth stocks will keep outperforming for another decade. In the end you are paying more for future cash flows, so theoretically it doesn’t make sense to expect higher returns, unless these growth stocks are so much more profitable than values stocks in general to the point where the probability premium overshadows the value premium. lemme check my magic eight ball.......\*sniff\* \*sniff\* never mind next decade.....I'd find it pretty hard to believe that doesn't.  The Mega cap tech are just so profitable and the model they have of buying up start ups before they can be a threat has worked way to good. To paraphrase Buffett and Munger, Growth and Value are not mutually exclusive. the principle behind buying wonderful companies at good prices instead of good companies at wonderful prices is essentially that its value to buy good growing companies as long as you arent overpaying for them. Vice versa, if a company isnt growing and is really mature, you might not want to buy them even at dirt cheap prices cos there isnt a future for them even if they dont necessarily go under, they just go nowhere.

So will growing companies out do cheap companies? Likely as long as the valuation you paid for them isnt egregious and as long as they keep growing more than the cheap ""value"" companies Are there any examples of customers actually benefitting from AI?

The S&P 500 closed at an all-time record high on Friday afternoon, extending breakneck gains achieved in recent weeks as investors shrugged off concerns about newly imposed tariffs and war in the Middle East.Despite stocks dipping slightly after President Donald Trump's announcement that the U.S. would end all trade talks with Canada, the S&P 500 recovered to close at a record high -- 6,173. Previously, the all-time high closing price was 6,144.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq also closed at a record high at 20,273.

What is everyone's thoughts on Google and the Open AI news ? Is this the news that will turn Google's year into something worthwhile or will it pull back and continue to trade sideways ? One analyst says they believe it can see $ 250. Does anyone agree with that ? I had much higher expectations for them after the dip , however it seems like it has taken forever for them do anything worthwhile.
200 soon. 250 if we lucky by eoy Google is 100% the play. First of all in all relevant regards its **better** than ChatGPT. It also **owns** the necessary data to continue to grow and improve the platform and it also has the reach to dominate the space. Did you start investing 6 months ago?

Googl has been an awesome stock forever, and is taking a short vacation currently It just shows how much better vision Google has compared to their competitors.

They started the TPUs over 12 years ago and now on the seventh generation.

Only now is Microsoft going to try to copy Google. I think with this news the market will price in further news upon more news. Who doesn’t love AI development. Meaning quick pump to 200 in the near term. 

Google is still so underrated. They still have so much to tap into. also fair value is $230 on RH. #ive been invested in googl and the rest of U.S big tech since 2016, I especially liked when googl doubled during the covid period, it had the highest return of the 5 for a long while,

#how about you? Jesus google hasn't even bought the gemini.com domain

They really need to push hard with Gemini . Most people I know go to chatgpt because that's what they remember / know. It's preposterous. 

Google has the capacity, the models, the TPUs, the everything to nuke openAI overnight, if it had the will. Does it not have the will? Every single person at the moment is saying how good google is at the moment, it’s cheap etc. Don’t you feel skeptical that everyone else is finding the same situation? there’s a reason it’s cheap, it’s struggling to find where to put its cash I don’t believe google is a good place to put your money personally. This is my opinion not saying anyone is wrong I just believe there’s much better investments then google Gemini.com is a crypto platform owned by the billionaire Winklevoss twins, the same twins that got fleeced by Mark Zuckerberg for their idea of Facebook.

This is a massive oversight from Google and the crypto platform is heavily benefiting from it. These guys are already billionaires so I already know the amount they want is astronomical.

https://www.crn.com/news/ai/2025/google-cloud-s-openai-deal-a-win-for-tpu-chips-microsoft-partner-says

Make no mistake, this is also a win for Google Cloud against Microsoft Azure,” says one Microsoft partner top executive. ‘[OpenAI] has continued, all year long, to loosen its dependency on Microsoft.

“Hats off to Google. They made the right R&D moves to win over a customer with lots of money to spend,” said the executive.

Google has its own DeepMind AI lab that competes directly against OpenAI around developing large language models (LLMs) for AI customers.

“[OpenAI] will be spending a ton of money on Google. They have $10 billion in sales. There’s money to be made here by Google,” the solution provider executive said. “We’re a big Azure shop, but I can see Google making some headwinds with its chips and cloud business overall because of the money they’re going to make on OpenAI. ... But we’re still big believers that Microsoft will be the leader in the AI era.”

I’m a huge Google bull. I see AI as a naturally oligopolistic industry. Multiple winners are possible. Google will lose in some areas, but win in others. 

However, you need the full stack. Google has the full stack. The Hardware, The Software, The Data, The Network, The Capital, and The Employees. No one else has it all. And it’s working. 

https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-convinces-openai-use-tpu-chips-win-nvidia

If Google fails at AI, that would be a tale for the ages about innovator’s dilemma. They have everything they need to win. I’m of the belief that Google Execs see the challenge. 

100 $180 December Longs, $200k of stock.  
>  Google has the full stack. The Hardware, The Software, The Data, The Network, The Capital, and The Employees. No one else has it all. And it’s working. 

But I thought Google was just a search company? I want people to continue to see it as a legacy boring dying Search company, until Q3 earnings ;) This post mostly was sparked by the OpenAI & Google TPU deal that The Information just leaked. 

I’m personally shocked. But I also think Google made that a requirement of the deal. Google is spreading their bets. If Search fails, GCP is going to boom. Boring search company that coincidentally had the highest income of any public company in the world pver the trailing 12 months Google has good presence in Ai cuz the money are not from individual subscriptions but software for Corps. Google already implemented models linked to internal documents in many organizations.

1lm2ch0,2025-06-27,"The market took 2 yrs to find bottom starting in ‘00 and 1.5 yrs starting in ‘07…
…It bottomed even lower post ‘07 than it did post ‘00.  The market was slightly down for an 11 yr period between ‘97 and ‘08.  Why so many bulls so confident that won’t happen again just bc it hasn’t for the last 17 yrs when very unlike now, we had extremely loose fiscal policy???
 If you are perpetually scared a market crash is imminent then hold your cash and bonds and chill for a decade. When the market is up 250% and you are up 25% dont say nobody warned you. 

Seriously though, if you are retiring within 10 years then yes it is reasonable to start investing more defensively incase of a market crash when you will be needing to make withdrawals. If you are 15+ years from retirement then who cares what the market does in the next 5 years. Your investments will recover long before you need them. Odds are always that they will go up. Nobody can predict a crash. Timing the market has proven to be counterproductive and you will, on average, miss out on more upside than downside. I am neither a bull nor bear but the very clear hole in your argument is the tariff stuff is without a doubt going to be a major economic issue when there is mixed middle ground. People celebrating ATHs and “stonks only go up” don’t understand purchasing power and forex. The dollar is plummeting, the SP500 is underperforming every other major market this year. Every economic indicator is slightly worse off than it was a year ago, things like tariffs and spoiled geopolitical relationships take time to show their effects. It’s not like Trump will tweet something stupid and the next day unemployment will rise 10%.  

During every major bear market stocks still went up and down. The market would move down 30%, up 20%, then down 25%. It’s not like bear markets are a straight line down for 10 years. During every rally of 2007 and 2008 people were making posts like “dO yOu FeEl dUmB sElLInG cUz PoLiTiCs” 

The fact that this post is filled with people saying the economy doesn’t have an effect on the stock market is all the proof you need of how dumb and naive the “traders” around here are. The dollar is being bled of value. Stocks aren’t the problem. Purchasing power is. Every bottom has an ATH before it. The issue is, will the bottom be this fall? 2 years from now? 1 year? Who knocks. We could have 2 more “bottoms” and 2 more ATHs before a huge crash or nothing at all We're literally at all time highs and you doomers think you can predict a bottom Priced in. I still believe we have not bottomed this year yet.  Tariffs are still unacceptably high.  Supply shock is coming.  Businesses operations are disrupted due to uncertainty.  Our good will with the rest of the world is long gone and will take a decade to rebuild.

1lm20gb,2025-06-27,"What are companies you plan on holding through a potential long tail?
I’m reading the Psychology of Money and am particularly enjoying the chapter on Long Tails.

The argument is that you only need a few big winners to become a winner yourself. If 90% of the stocks you pick don’t work, that’s okay as long as 1% are slam dunks.

Think picking Apple or Microsoft in the 90s, for example.

What are some stocks you feel safe investing in now, and holding for the foreseeable future to try and capitalize on their long tails? 
RKLB, ASTS, and RDDT Netflix, I bought when it dipped though. Valuation is kind of stretched right now. But I still believe in them and think they can hit a market cap of 1 trillion dollars. 

They can keep expanding into sports and live entertainment. Plus who knows maybe news is next and getting content creators as well. Plus short film content is another content path as well. 
They’re becoming global cable 2.0 imo. 

They can also diversify their revenue from advertising and merchandise and experiences are the easy ones they should be able to tackle imo. They’re creating something called Netflix houses which is sort of like Disneys theme parks. We’ll see if they’re successful or not. 
Moonshot ones are gaming but if they can crack it. They’ll turn into an entertainment juggernaut imo. Yes and no. If you had bought Microsoft or Apple 10 years ago you would still currently be sitting on a 10× & almost 10× currently. These were both universally known companies in 2015 that were no brainers to invest in, yet some people gambled on unproven and speculative stuff and didn't invest at all in these sure things.


They may not be the 30-50x return in 6 months that a lot of young guys come in expecting after seeing a few guys on social media become overnight millionaires from scam crypto coins and Gamestop options...but a 10× in 10 years is a fuckin hell of a return. Way better than what the vast majority of  individual people, the best hedge funds or indexes return over the same time period. Problem it is almost impossible to pick the Apples and Microsofts before they get big. If it was so easy then everyone would do it AMD This exactly. People want like 100 baggers which is very rare.

1lm0fuf,2025-06-27,"What is the best thing to do to prepare for tax season if you made a good profit of a stock?
Hi everyone. I have been going through a hypothetical about how to handle taxes the next year if some stock does well and I sell at a target price. I'm curious about others take on it.

So here is a scenario: Let's say you make $80,000 profit from a stock sale and it takes place today, June 27th. You have a 24-25% short term capital gains tax rate. Thus, you can pocket roughly $60,000 and you have to pay $20,000 in taxes. Let's assume that you don't have to pay any other income taxes and you always get a small refund every year.

 Should you just place it in an interest bearing account until tax time? 

Should you place it in a safe stock or fund with low volatility until at least January 2nd or tax paying time? 

Should you roll the dice and put it back in some high risk/high reward stocks with a reasonably tight stop loss?

Im curious about your views.

Thanks 😊 
Sell some of your losers which you don’t want to keep to offset the gain. Lose it all I'm not an expert but here is what i do:  With every sell event, whether there are gains or losses, i maintain a running tally of my projected tax obligations through the year.  In that spreadsheet I also include rows for ""anticipated"" sell events that haven't occurred yet (using a different font in the spreadsheet to differentiate).

I have up to the present time treated my net estimated tax bill like an emergency fund (do not touch).  That's to say: I maintain that amount of funds in SGOV (treasuries, like a HYSA), where it is going to make appreciable tax-advantaged gains each month and is not subject to market swings/volatility.

This practice gives me peace of mind... but on further thought it might be unneccessarily conservative...

If hypothetically you dump he $20k owed for short-term capital gains into some high-risk penny stock or an Enron that could lose all its value, WITHIN THE SAME CALENDAR YEAR, then that commensurate loss would dollar-for-dollar offset and eliminate your original $20k tax owed...

This sould seem like a zero-risk opportunity (investing/gambling with Uncle Sam's  or ""house"" money) if you consider the original tax obligation a ""sunk cost"" otherwise.... The world doesn't have a lot of ""free lunches"" so I suspect I'm missing something here... 

One caveat to this logic/strategy is you don't want your risky investment to tank on or after Jan 1, or you'll be stuck with the original gains & tax obligation from this year even if your funds disappear... It would be prudent to exit any risky positions like this towards the end of the calendar year, to ""lock in"" whatever gains or losses will be realized.  It would also be a good idea prior to investing those funds to pay very close attention to wash sale rules to ensure you don't accidentally void your ability to harvest tax losses you may have to realize later.


I'm curious to hear others' perspectives... i feel like i must be missing something with this idea! https://www.irs.gov/faqs/estimated-tax/large-gains-lump-sum-distributions-etc/large-gains-lump-sum-distributions-etc If I have any bad losers I want to drop I do it at the end of the year to offset my gains and bring that down a bit. Answering my own question after a little homework & time with an LLM:  This is not a ""free lunch"" and not a strategy I would endorse or pursue.  

I was confusing myself over how tax loss harvesting is applied.  If you do invest and lose all of the $20k as suggested in the original example, you ***could*** use that to reduce the $80k in profit/gains down to $60k, but you would still need to pay taxes on that reduced net capital gains at the given STCG rate ($60k x 0.25 = $15k still owed on April 15).  That would leave you needing to find another 15k to satisfy the tax man.

  
So, it's not like a casino where the house gives you chips to ""use or lose"" - you'll still owe the house (just less) if you blow your tax obligation funds at the roulette wheel.  

  
I'm going to continue down the path of ""setting aside"" gains owed to Uncle Sam, but doing so specifically by parking those funds in SGOV - a manner that allows those funds to grow modestly with very low risk and with tax advantages on the interest income. Whatever you do, you will need to pay capital gains tax — that’s the rule you should follow. Any other approach could cause you to lose money. If you use a tax software program for last year's taxes open that up. Open last year's tax return and save it as '2025 test' or something. Then put in the capital gains that you think you'll make for the year see how the taxes work out. 


Then you'll know.


Also the IRS likes to have quarterly tax payments if you think you're going to make that much money. I usually send in $500 a quarter as a minimum. Change your withholding to account for increased income. 

Prepay estimated tax by Sept 15 2025 and January 15 2026.

Use irs.gov tax withholding estimator. You may want to pay estimated taxes in the quarter with those gains.  Otherwise, IRS complains about those and gets you penalized.",0,0.23,15,0,C_Teezy,stocks,['C'],best thing prepare tax season made good profit stock hi everyone going hypothetical handle taxes next year stock well sell target price im curious others take scenario lets say make 80000 profit stock sale takes place today june 27th 2425 short term capital gains tax rate thus pocket roughly 60000 pay 20000 taxes lets assume dont pay income taxes always get small refund every year place interest bearing account tax time place safe stock fund low volatility least january 2nd tax paying time roll dice put back high riskhigh reward stocks reasonably tight stop loss im curious views thanks sell losers dont want keep offset gain lose im expert every sell event whether gains losses maintain running tally projected tax obligations year spreadsheet also include rows anticipated sell events havent occurred yet using different font spreadsheet differentiate present time treated net estimated tax bill like emergency fund touch thats say maintain amount funds sgov treasuries like hysa going make appreciable taxadvantaged gains month subject market swingsvolatility practice gives peace mind thought might unneccessarily conservative hypothetically dump 20k owed shortterm capital gains highrisk penny stock enron could lose value within calendar year commensurate loss would dollarfordollar offset eliminate original 20k tax owed sould seem like zerorisk opportunity investinggambling uncle sams house money consider original tax obligation sunk cost otherwise world doesnt lot free lunches suspect im missing something one caveat logicstrategy dont want risky investment tank jan 1 youll stuck original gains tax obligation year even funds disappear would prudent exit risky positions like towards end calendar year lock whatever gains losses realized would also good idea prior investing funds pay close attention wash sale rules ensure dont accidentally void ability harvest tax losses may realize later im curious hear others perspectives feel like must missing something idea bad losers want drop end year offset gains bring bit answering question little homework time llm free lunch strategy would endorse pursue confusing tax loss harvesting applied invest lose 20k suggested original example could use reduce 80k profitgains 60k would still need pay taxes reduced net capital gains given stcg rate 60k x 025 15k still owed april 15 would leave needing find another 15k satisfy tax man like casino house gives chips use lose youll still owe house less blow tax obligation funds roulette wheel im going continue path setting aside gains owed uncle sam specifically parking funds sgov manner allows funds grow modestly low risk tax advantages interest income whatever need pay capital gains tax thats rule follow approach could cause lose money use tax software program last years taxes open open last years tax return save 2025 test something put capital gains think youll make year see taxes work youll know also irs likes quarterly tax payments think youre going make much money usually send 500 quarter minimum change withholding account increased income prepay estimated tax sept 15 2025 january 15 2026 use irsgov tax withholding estimator may want pay estimated taxes quarter gains otherwise irs complains gets penalized
1llz7l5,2025-06-27,"Trump Announces Mineral Rights Deal With Congo What does this mean for the stock market?
Just saw the big news: Trump brokered a mineral deal between the U.S. and the DRC that will give U.S. firms access to key minerals such as cobalt, tantalum, lithium, and copper in exchange for U.S. support for the Congo-Rwanda peace deal 

This looks like more than just geopolitical maneuvering, it could have long-term implications for the stock market and certain stocks.

Brief summary

The U.S., pushed by Trump, brokered a peace deal between Congo and Rwanda and signed a multi-billion dollar “minerals for security” agreement.

Trump's allies and private companies (including Massad Boulos) plan to invest over $500 million to build a smelter there, with the goal of moving away from dependence on the Chinese mineral chain.

Why this deserves investor attention

KEY MINERALS, STRATEGIC MATERIALS 

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) controls roughly 70 percent of the world's cobalt and 60 percent of its tantalum reserves-metals widely used in electric car batteries, chips, electronics, and military technology.

If the U.S. can establish its own supply chain, the global industrial landscape could be rewritten.

Capital Flows Could Change 

If U.S. miners and tech companies get in first, companies like Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), Albemarle (ALB), or lithium material companies like Livent (LTHM) could be the winners.

 Geo Risks vs Market Opportunities 

The Congo situation remains complex - if a peace deal stands, commodity prices could stabilize and U.S. firms may be able to gain control of resources in the long term; conversely, a short-term landmine.

Impact on Tech & EV Sectors 

OEMs such as Tesla and the battery chain (e.g., NVDA, TSLA, BATT-type ETFs) could benefit if cobalt and lithium supplies become more stable and EV production costs fall.

CURRENT MARKET REACTION: 

Global mining stocks rallied in the early stages of the peace deal rumors, but then retreated as details of the deal remain unclear

Market Sentiment: cautiously optimistic and bullish in the long term, but short-term uncertainties remain (situation, implementation, opposition factions, etc.)

My recommendations from an investment perspective

Long-term Layout Focus on resource stocks (e.g. ALB, FCX) - once the agreement is implemented, it is a probable event for US companies to acquire substantial mineral resources.

Medium-term ideas Tracking battery, electric vehicle sector - if the cost of raw materials downward, vehicle margins and growth logic benefit.

Short-term operation Pay attention to the progress of events - the peace agreement is unstable and may be repeated; if you intervene, you can add a stop loss or hedge.

Macro observation If the United States to “resource diplomacy” as a means of follow-up in Greenland, Ukraine and other places may also have similar operations.

Some of my questions

Has anyone been following cobalt or lithium resource stocks? Any early layouts for this wave?

Do you think this peace deal is sustainable, or is it just a “paper peace”?

Bigger question: does this mean that China is loosening its grip on key minerals?
The cobalt market is massively oversupplied, to the point that Congo voluntarily halted all exports earlier this year to try to build some sort of floor under the collapsing price. They extended this halt another three months just last week. Even with Congo's production held back the price hasn't gone through the roof, and they haven't stopped mining so the market will flood again when they give up. Risks over future supply due to issues in the region have always made people a bit reluctant to build things that rely on it. The tin market got hit recently with rebels and warlords disrupting the big producer there.

Lithium is a waste product found on oil fields, the US has loads of the stuff domestically. Another massively oversupplied market after companies rushed in after the big processing-related price spike a few years ago.

To my knowledge none of this stuff was out of reach to US comapnies previously, only Congo's copper had a few hurdles with the country requiring refining happen in-country rather than shipping concentrate to China or elsewhere. You mean Erik Prince announced? No, this blackwater resource extraction and 'protection' scheme is dead in the water. It doesn't deal with the actual problem of the poorly drawn borders and weak governments, it just takes more advantage of it. Yeah f preventing aids in africa, but the minerals from there... ooo wee! That dude is straight evil This is the stocks subreddit. Do you know a pharma stock about to pump? What are you doing here? its not that China has a grip on the minerals they have a grip on the refining or processing of the minerals.  So finding them is fine, its turning the raw product into a useable product is still going to be in bulk in China, which will allow them to halt exports if they choose. Mining in DRC? HA! Good luck with that. Is there a roulette table? Not sure, I think most African graphite is found on the East coast in the Madagasgar/Mozambique/Malawi area. It's highly specialised and only certain deposits are useful for particlar applications due to flake sizes, so even if you have a source it might not be what you need for a specific battery use. Very complex market.

I own shares in Sovereign Metals which is a titanium oxides/graphite development project in Malawi, likely to be bought out by mining giant Rio Tinto in the next few years.

1llysj9,2025-06-27,"Shorting Starbucks seems like free money right now - here is my DD.
Starbucks has seen their revenues shrink over their last 5 quarters consecutively, while the EPS have sunk at an even faster rate during this time. Everything I've seen suggests this trend will accelerate. 

A quick look at the balance sheet shows that the company is insolvent. Starbucks is heavily indebted and will have to borrow more as it's not even close to covering its current liabilities, and the book value is negative.

Retained earnings have been negative the last 6 years, while the dividend payout ratio has exceeded 85% and growing. Its stores in China (where they've grossly overextended their footprint) are getting killed by Luckin, and sales have been down in US as well. This is a consumer discretionary which suffers greatly in downturns (oops consumer sentiment is at 40 year lows now). And cheaper coffee alternatives are not hard to find.

The explosion of weight loss drug use doesn't bode well for Starbucks's sugary cold drinks which are the lion's share of its profits, as these medications tend to curtail cravings for sugar.

Then you also have historically high coffee prices (spiking demand in emerging markets, tariffs don't help), declining brand sentiment and consumer reviews, and a company searching for an identity under its new leadership (do they want automation? do they want their stores to be hang-out shops?) in an industry with virtually no barriers to entry. Anywhere there is a Starbucks there are numerous local mom and pop coffee shops which customers increasingly are choosing over corporate chains, and consistently have much higher reviews.



All these and this company still has the audacity to trade at a P/E double that of Google's (yeah, yeah, not an apt comparison, sue me.. it's still absurd to me).

  
Disclaimer: I am short SBUX via the common shares.
Shorting anything is never free money. It's a gamble I hope you win. Very reasonable and sound argument, which means you can expect the exact opposite. This market don’t run on reason. My wife spends way too much money there. Bullish.

Have you even tried their pinkidy drinkidy? Bullish. Never bet against white girl stocks; people learned this the hard way during the pandemic. 

They can restructure their capital structure, sell off assets or subsidiaries, reduce costs, etc. There's a ton of options on the table for them. 

Even if your thesis is all correct, I don't think your shorts will survive long enough to profit during a record stock market.  And I don't think your assumptions are correct at all.  The Company certainly has its challenges but is far from ""insolvent"". For sure, seems like an obvious choice to me but a definite hyperbole objectively. Goes without saying, I hope nobody gambles any of their own money on my dumbass analysis. i'm not one to short but i looked at the financials after previous earnings report and decided to sell my entire SBUX position and dump it into MSFT, turned out to be a good idea so far Agreed, this market is not rational. SBUX is up 16% over the past year despite falling everything and really nothing to get excited about. This is definitely an entertaining post for sure. Is their balance sheet upside down? Yes. Are they insolvent? Absolutely not 

Most of their debt has a lower rate than the prime, let alone prime + 1/2 which is the going rate for BBB+

4b matures in 5-10 yrs with a rate of 4%

Another 4b matures in 15-25 years, again with a rate of 4% 

Their FCF can easily pay off their LT debt in 3 years but why would they when the prime rate exceeds their debt rate?

1lmal1e,2025-06-28,"OpenAI taps Google Cloud TPUs in bid to diversify AI chip supply

It’s incredible how people don’t see just how set up for AI domination Google is. 

They’re literally the only company that can actually vertically integrate this shit.

Who else has data on 8B people and the literal Tower of Babel when it comes to video content to train their models This is the holy Grail and GOOG is so undervalued. They literally own the infrastructure to run their own models, from the silicon to the datacenters to the data itself; meanwhile competitors have to rent GPUs to run their stuff. Heck they are even heavily invested and leading quantum computers. Another thing worth mentioning is that their TPUs have been getting better and better every generation. It's only a matter of time before GOOG stops using NVIDIA GPUs all together. I was thinking to myself that GOOGL and AMZN and AAPL have had it rough the past month and are next to break ATHs. Maybe this is where it happens, my GOOGL calls went from -10k to +3.4k in a week Side note: google doesn’t use nvida gpu’s for their llm they buy them in bulk for their cloud division so they’ll likely always buy from nvidia but google itself doesn’t need nvidia for these things. You are correct, GOOG runs their llms in their TPUs. But they still purchase a ton of Nvidia GPUs because some customers actually demand them. My point is that once GOOG TPUs and llms become more efficient, there won't be much of a need for power hungry Nvidia GPUs. I agree and I think it cannot be overstated just how significant it is that OpenAI is even entertaining using something other than NVDA hardware, even more so settling for an older generation of Alphabet’s in house chips. 

This is not priced in yet for either GOOG or NVDA. I’d expect to start seeing some weakness in NVDA if we keep getting more news about new collabs like this. Nvidia is sold OUT. They will alwqys be sold out.

This delusion has to stop lmao. Can good get to 200 already For me, this is the biggest risk factor for NVDA.

1lm9b9z,2025-06-28,"Thanks Robinhood, still won’t use your fucking app though
Held for 3 months already, wish I had done more honestly
It’s honestly fine now but like 2019-2020 it was a lottery for plays to go through on the opening bell. Almost like a sneaker release lol What are the cons of using robinhood app? People hate on Robin Hood bc they disabled the sell button while other platforms were able to sell. This didn’t happen just once, it happened on numerous occasions causing retail investors to lose money. Nothing wrong with app and probably best out there. Advanced desktop trading is certainly not as advanced as others but the app is fantastic. It’s a model of excellent UI and intuitiveness that others are trying to get to.

But they still have that whole gamestop cloud. It’s been years and it’s now history. They are way better capitalized, larger scale, etc. people have multi-million retirement accounts there now. But people will keep bringing it up. It will be year 2135, our AI overlords using our emotional receptors to vibe trade on the market leading Robinhood global finance platform and someone will say, “but my great grandpa said to ‘Remember Gamestop’” Were you not around for the GameStop surge a few years back? What they are leaving out is that other brokerage platforms also suspended trading such as TD Ameritrade for the same reasons. Nothing wrong with Robinhood I honestly don't even understand why it's so hated on this sub. 95% of the regards that lost money on the GameStop thing have to be totally btfo by now. It's probably just like all the morons that use Reddit on a daily basis saying how much it sucks and to short the stock lol Ppl hate on robinhood because its popular and accessible. There’s literally zero reason to dislike the app, it’s the easiest to use People give RH shit for the GME/citadel PFOF issue, but then go onto using other brokerages (see list below) that were in the same exact boat. RH was the big dog and eliminated tradings fees first, so they took a brunt of the reputational damage. I was and am still a CS user primarily, but keep a small options port on RH now. RH works fine for what it is.

This is incorrect. Its because OpenAI is choosing to use google TPUs to lower training costs. Goog has had a plethora of PT hikes over the past few months. OpenAI using their chips and TPUv8 architecture means that the market will now realize they’ve overlooked a legitimate sleeper.

Shareholder Vote Day: July 15th | IPO Day: \~July 17th

Will look at more OTM calls next week as we get closer to IPO day. If you owned shares on June 20th make sure to vote in favor of business combination. Takes less than a minute Based on the complaining that he bought ITM/ATM vs OTM and Aug vs July, it's very clear a lot of folks have no idea how to play this still. Without even knowing the stock price potential or the ticker name and change, just looking at the options would have been clear this is best done ITM/ATM and with ""some"" time. He's said this again and again, slow run up to $20, maybe 30 premerger. Aug 10/12.5/15 would maxed the delta gains and minimized the theta decay. If you're risk averse, sell your cost. If you're feeling frisky, you can still roll up (and out if you like), as IV will still not have captured the potential move and you're only then trading this the day before and after the merger. My personal expectations is anywhere from 3-6x of whatever the pre merger price is.

Edit: he never gave exact premerger prices but he did say flat this week (which happened) then slow run up (in the works it seems).

Edit 2: funny how much advice people seek regarding their positions/money.

A little options 101:

July IV will remain as kk has stated as this is just like earnings. So your options will probably still have some value even if theta does start working against you. The risk there is theta and no positive price move of the underlying between now and merger date. I.e., your contracts lose value prior to July 15 and you panic sell for a loss without even getting the potential merger move. If you can't hold through that, you were f'd from the start and you were better off just buying whatever you wanted on July 15, regardless of the underlying price.

Rolling is up to you but the point of the near contract was that it's cheaper but riskier thus you can leverage more by buying more contracts for the same $$$. If you look at the same strike for July vs Aug you'll see the exact difference in price. Literally it is right in front of you for you to see. Again, you have the leverage of buy more July's bc it's cheaper. 

Similarly, if you're OTM that was your call but again, those will likely maintain some value all the way to the premerger date due to IV. The entire point of OTM is again leverage to buy more contracts at a cheaper price.

By way of example for people trying to math this out or just understand the contracts and positions they have, take a hypothetical $5 move from $15 to $20 right now [meaning literally as of right now] just moves everything up the options chain $5 so you can figure out how much your option would be worth approximately, that as a percentage is somewhere between 40-50% gain-ish. As with anything OTM, you typically need a bigger move to make it work but you in turn tend to have a higher percentage gain + leverage of more contracts.

That being said, I'll keep this as simple as I can...per kk the exact play is trying to ride the slow train up and IF needed you can take profits or adjust pre merger. I will ride calls to just before the date of the merger and depending on if those are profitable, I might take some off the table. More than likely, I will double down, max out my leverage on July 15 and wait knowing I'll either 10x+ or bust.

1lm1z1l,2025-06-27,"Trump Cuts Off Trade Talks With Canada, Threatens to Set Tariff
And here we go again.
EVERY TIME I INVEST

I INVEST IN NVDA, DOWN FOR 6 MONTHS
NOW I INVEST IN ATD, IN ONLY 2 WEEKS, DOWN 8%

How many fuking months before ATD rebounds? Canada's digital services tax was passed into law two years ago. It is not new. What *is* new is that the senate just removed Trump's ""revenge tax"" from his tax bill so he's enraged. Most Western countries either already have a DST or are implementing one.

Further, Trump again repeats the *ridiculous* dairy lies. The US sells *far* more dairy tariff free to Canada than the reverse. Trump relies upon the American electorate being incredibly stupid and misinformed, and he's probably right in assuming that. Anyone brave enough to get calls for Monday SPY/SPX. Follow a typical “buy the dip” reversal on Monday? Always on a Friday right before close. Stock up on calls for when he reverses on Sunday Trump Sunday at 5:57pm “ I just spoke with Prime Minister Carney and he’s a great man. Trade deal IMMINENT. Thank you for your attention on this matter.” Just hold that shit....he'll announce something next week and it'll come right back up. He's simply manipulating the market. Is this why the stocks suddenly drop Trump still doesn’t know how tariffs work. 

He tweeted out “We will let them know the tariff that Canada will be paying to do business with the United States”

1lm1ikv,2025-06-27,"Circle under $200 today, under $100 in 3 months
Circle operates like a giant money-market fund on a blockchain. You give them $100, they issue you 100 USD stablecoins. They invest your $100 in short-term treasuries and pocket the interest. When you redeem, they return your $100, burn those stablecoins, and pocket the interest earned. That is the entire model: mint, invest, burn, repeat.

Their whole business depends on earning interest from user deposits.

  
4 major issues:

1. Competition is about to explode. Stablecoins are multiplying fast, and once the GENIUS Act passes, every bank will be rolling out its own. There is no reason a bank would let Circle make interest on customer deposits when they could issue their own stablecoin and keep those profits themselves.

2. Interest margins are already under pressure. Other issuers are starting to return more of that yield directly to users. Some are giving back nearly all of it to win customers over. Stablecoins have become an adoption tactic, not a sustainable cash cow. Circle will eventually have to share more of that interest just to keep customers around, killing its profits.

They are also completely exposed to interest rates. Higher rates help Circle earn more. When rates fall, so does their revenue. Powell will cut rates eventually, and Circle has no other meaningful revenue streams to cushion the hit.

3. The valuation is hard to justify

They peaked at $20 billion, crashed to $5 billion pre-IPO, and somehow bounced back to $46 billion. They made $1.45 billion in 2023 and $1.6 billion in 2024, which is a 28x revenue multiple. Half of that revenue comes through a partner, Coinbase, that is already sharing yield with its customers. For Circle to even get near $10 billion in revenue, the entire stablecoin market would need to grow 7x, assuming no competition.

There is no moat, no pricing power, no differentiation. Competitors will squeeze Circle until there is nothing left, and customers will chase whoever gives them more yield.

4. Only around 11% - 18% of the stock is in the public float, with a 180-day lockup. Once that expires, insiders will be ready to dump.

This is going back to 50 very soon.

You're thinking too much, this is a casino, no one cares about reality, Nvidia is trading at a price to earnings ratio of 49.78, and Palantir is at 621.30!!! nah bro.  P/E is 2,600.  Totally undervalued.  I'll be buying until P/E is \~10,000 at which point I may consider selling 1 share. Dude honestly, WTF Palantir? What is going on with that fucking company I don't get it. Not even PLTR employees have any idea what the company does. I don't care if PLTR PE gets over 9000. I won't buy it at these levels. I'm super bullish on NVDA though. Stable coins are litterally just gift card 2.0. Why the fuck do I need a stablecoin? Dumbest shit ever after NFTs. They are the US government now. Yield snipping Makes palantir look like the most value company in the s&p 500 Do you like waiting 5-7 business days for your money to settle? What about when you move funds from your bank account to your broker? Not all will let you trade instantly if the funds aren't settled depending on the stock. What if it reduced your overall cost since the transaction is less than what swift charges?

It also gives more countries access to the US dollar where their currency is being devalued drastically.

1lmque0,2025-06-28,"Everyone’s watching Bitcoin. I’m watching Copper.
While everyone’s busy tracking ETF flows into Bitcoin, I am looking at something interesting - Copper. Not many are really talking about it. Next 10 years are likely to be about clean energy, EV, battery storage, AI infra, data centres. So, copper demand is inevitable everywhere. EVs need 3 to 4 times more copper than traditional cars. Infrastructure to charge needs copper. Solar panels need copper. Wind turbines need copper. AI Infra, data centres - need copper wires and connectors. 

Supply <> Demand Mismatch: Demand is going up. But supply is not increasing in proportion - in fact getting worse.  
Copper is not like bitcoin. Can’t mine by plugging in a rig. Copper mines take 7 to 10 years from discovery to actual production. So many hurdles like political risks, approvals, labour challenges, ESG issues and a lot. Some big mines are hitting limits.

Inventories low. That’s not good. Global inventories near multiple year lows. Very little buffer. .If any mine halts, prices can spike fast. 

**Is copper the new oil?**   
2000s were driven by oil. May be, 2020s might be driven by copper + AI infra + green energy transition. And yet… Not a lot of hype which is good.

What happens when prices go up? Copper is trading att around $9,500–10,000/ton.  
If it crosses $12,000, can be  huge margins for miners, refiners, and even copper based manufacturing firms.

**What can happen to these firms?**  
Mining giants with copper-heavy portfolios, Infra companies doing high-voltage transmission, Power cable manufacturers, Switchgear and cooling tech firms, Data center infra players May not happen tmrw. But in long-term trends, this is where this is headed.

I am watching this pattern and don't mind going deep into it. Basically: if copper hits a supply wall, who wins? Miners. Infra. Power cables and other global players in this space.

Are you tracking this space?  Watching any companies? In case if you think this is overhyped theme, happy to hear your thoughts.

1lmqqge,2025-06-28,"My dad has a Morgan Stanley managed 401k. He's in retirement : should be now hire a adviser to check his account?
Hi , so my dad has a 401k through  his work with Morgan Stanley. There's a manager that oversees this but I'm not sure how much personal care he gives. 

My dad lost a lot during the 2008 downturn like 30k or so and he was told by the manager if he takes out 1800 a month he will have about 10 years worth of money for retirement. 
He also has a annuity he purchased but he's not sure if it's worth it. He recently got a letter saying that they sold the company but the manager says it might be a scam. 
Now the manager is supposed to give him a bit of help answering some questions however I'm not sure if he would be better off hiring a one time adviser to look over his portfolio to see if he should move around some stuff. 

Is this manager for his 401k supposed to be a fiduciary? I'm not 100% sure where his interest will lie. 
My dad is currently still working and collecting Social Security because he just doesn't have enough right now to be safe retiring fully.

Since he lost so much do you think he should stay with less conservative stuff  right now?

1lmpaux,2025-06-28,"401k & Roth IRA split for young investor
Hello, all! I am entering my first full-time job after college graduation. I have heard that it is good to invest 10-15% (or more if able) to retirement, which is my aim. I currently have a Roth IRA I have put a little money into here and there over the past few years since I was in high school, mostly in mutual funds with a little more of an aggressive mix.

The company I will work for offers a 401k match at 100% for the first 1% and 50% for the next 5%. My question is, given the higher earning potential with a Roth, would it be best to max out the 401k match from my company and then contribute the rest into the Roth IRA? I probably would just max at the $7,000 limit with this split, which would put me at roughly 15%. Or should I just concentrate all my contributions into one account? I believe the split with the Roth is the better option from what I have seen but just wanting to get some more opinions on the matter.

I am frugal. I’m afraid of investing my personal savings, outside of my retirement from work. But, I also know, having it in a HYSA at 3.60% isn’t amazing. That money can pay off my mortgage basically today, but my mortgage is at 2.9%. I guess it makes sense to keep the mortgage and invest it all. So, my question is, is VTI and VT a smart decision? 
Yes. If you plan to (mostly) not touch it for a decade or three.

If less than a decade, the answer gets murky.

I hope you’re investing in tax advantaged retirement accounts too. If not, then live off some of this money while you max out all of those. 2.9% per the post. I wouldn’t bother paying that off quicker at all. HYSA arbitrage at a minimum. If you predicted the great financial crisis of 2008, and you kept your cash safely tucked under the mattress… it would be worth $225,000 today. In the same time period, sp500 has 3.5x your money, not including dividends you would’ve received Do NOT pay off your mortgage. broseph you can easily make like 50% better returns without additional risk putting that into SGOV (especially if you live in a high tax city and state) Though there is value in being debt free and if that is a really high priority for you then so be it, but in general, most financially savvy folks would strongly recommend you do not pay that off any faster than you have to. Bruh, you can get more than 2.99 in an HYSA risk free by placing 180k in 2 different accounts (to be under the 250k FDIC limit) and arbitrage 1.5% annually for free. It gives you liquidity, the choice to pay your mortgage if you want, and to make a tiny little bit on the arbitrage but I’d argue that having risk free liquidity at 0 cost is better than debt free. You are better to put your emergency fund into something like SGOV that is a bit more stable. The other side of me wants to just pay off my mortgage. I’m 32M. Bought for $625k and owe $361.

1lmofzg,2025-06-28,"Whole/Universal Life Insurance as an investment?
Hey all.  I was searching some posts on here but i'm still unclear as to how this works.

My buddy has come to the conclusion that whole/universal life insurance may be a good investment tool.  I'll be the first to admit, I know nothing about life insurance, but from what I've been reading, I just don't see how this could be an investment vehicle.

Does anyone have any knowledge on the subject that can simplify it for me so I can tell him he's better off with other avenues?  Or maybe he's correct in his thinking and it's my lack of knowledge on the subject that is in play here.  Either way, I figure i'll learn something new

  
Appreciate it
Whole life is usually only good for the sales person that sells it to you I have always been of the opinion that term life is a much better way to go. Keep investments completely separate from life insurance. Horrible as an investment Unless you are very wealthy and want to skirt the estate taxes when you die (over 28 million married) there is little benefit to it

You are better off fully maxing out your 401k/IRA/HSA/529 accounts

I guess if you have maxed out every tax advantaged account to the max and still have money left over , its still sort of worthless . You would almost be better off buying low cost term insurance and just investing in a taxable account As someone who just spent a long time looking at this after getting sold a whole life policy years ago… DONT it’s not as good as money in the market. I ate my losses and cashed out recently. Don’t do it

- you pay a ton of fees up front so you don’t start “investing” till later
- they don’t make nearly the returns you could make in other. Invest ment vehicles
- there are all sorts of restrictions on when you can use it 

Jsut by term life and invest it in spy Don't, just don't...

When you need insurance you buy insurance. When you need to invest you invest. Absolutely nothing good comes from merging the two. It is basically investing with a fuck ton of fees and restrictions.

Currently the cash value of my investment accounts is the balance of my investment accounts. The total fees for say, my VOO holdings, (S&P 500 index fund) is 0.03%. Any time the market is open I can buy and sell in my taxed account, giving me complete liquidity. My tax advantaged accounts (401k, IRA, HSA) may not be as unrestricted, but the tax perks make up for it. This is only a good investment tool for VERY VERY few people. I would say easily 3% or less.  I have a Variable University Life Insurance policy, which is similar, and while I have unique circumstances that made it make sense for me, it is still not a ""good"" investment in the traditional sense. My brokerage and 401k all do better; though my VUL is earning comparable with some alternative investments such as P2P lending and real estate notes. Again, I had unique family dynamics related to a person in my family being uninsurable that made it make sense for me. But if you're looking for straight up profit maximization, grab a cheap term policy and invest the rest in the market. I got one setup at 19
47 now

It doesn't require monthly payments anymore it's got enough value but up to cover coats

1lmo81w,2025-06-28,"Is SGOV better than SPAXX?
I’ll start by saying I have 10-12 months of living expenses in an emergency fund, I’m maxing my Roth IRA yearly, I have a SEP IRA because I run/own a business, and I invest in a taxable fidelity account monthly to the point I have 117k in there and I’m 31.

I have 20k sitting in SPAXX and I’m wondering if SGOV is a better place for it? Based on my understanding of the numbers, SGOV is about 1% higher yield? 3.98% in fidelity SPAXX, vs 4.98%?

Am I understanding these numbers right? Less liquidity is no problem since I behave as if all my investments don’t exist on a daily basis, and I don’t need that money any time soon (5+ years)
> Based on my understanding of the numbers, SGOV is about 1% higher yield? 3.98% in fidelity SPAXX, vs 4.98%?

Show us where you're seeing SGOV having a 4.98% yield. As another business owner, if it’s just you, consider an owner 401k tripped my contributions. 

If you got employees it’s more difficult and I would stay SEP. 

I moved everything but 2 months of cash to SGOV. It’s t+1 and I never need the emergency cash that day. I don’t think the spread is quite as high as you stated but SGOV does seem to have a bit higher yield then SPAXX. It’s also going to be state tax free. > I have 20k sitting in SPAXX and I’m wondering if SGOV is a better place for it?

Expand your horizons a bit: Also consider SP**R**XX and, if you have the minimum for it, FZDXX.

As of yesterday: • SPAXX 3.95% • SPRXX 4.01% • FZDXX 4.13% ""Better"" in this case is subjective and depends a lot on your tax bracket.

Last week, after some research, I switched from SPAXX to SGOV.

Unfortunately you can't select SGOV as your cash position at Fidelity, so you need to do buys/sells.

Keep in mind that SGOV is tax-free at the State and local level (I live in NYC). 30 day sec yield of SGOV is 4.18% not 4.98%. I’m not entirely sure I’m understanding what I’m reading, hence the question. But when I click into SGOV in fidelity, I see 1, 3, 5 and 10 year rows, with columns named NAV return and Market Return. Both under 1 year say 4.98. 

I do also see something called “distribution yield (TTM)” that has 4.61% next to it. Is the state tax a consideration if I live in WA state? There’s no state income tax here SPRXX or FZDXX have any state tax benefits like FDLXX? You need to look for the ""SEC yield"". That tells you what the actual annual yield would be after expense ratio subtraction, if the yield from the past month were annualized. That is the number to use to compare yields between bond funds. Alternatively, some bond funds list ""30 day yield"" or ""7 day yield"", those are good for comparison purposes too. They are also annualized yields based on the actual yield from the past 30 or 7 days. 

The yield from the past 1 year in those multi-year columns is already outdated because the interest rate may have changed quite a bit (and often in only one direction) during the past year.

1lmmjn6,2025-06-28,"Withdrawal from margin to get access to capital temporarily, strategy and guides lines
Okay so let’s say you have a taxable portfolio with significant gains you have been investing for years. You want to continue to hold the positions and do not want to pay taxes so selling shares so off the table. 

But you need a good amount of cash temporarily ( 1-3 months for an emergency/investment opportunity) you are still earning and will be actively paying down or able to get financing to get the cash back and pay down the margin

What are some good guidelines to follow in terms of a safe amount of margin to take out in relation to overall portfolio? And ways to hedge to avoid margin calls if you were to need more? 

Seems to me a small amount let’s say 5-15% of the portfolio would be safe in most situations as long as you’re diversified. But getting higher than a certain percentage starts getting much more risky and using some type of hedge like options for that 1-3 months would be needed. 


A pledged asset line of credit would have a lower interest rate than margin - that's another way to borrow against your portfolio. Last time I looked the interest for a PAL was around 10%. Generally margin is if the money you borrow stays in the brokerage (i.e. you use it to buy securities at the same brokerage) and PAL is for taking cash out of the brokerage for something else (real estate, starting a business, etc). 

And borrowing 5-15% of portfolio should be ok, they may give you a higher leeway than that, like 50% but it's not a good idea to get close to the borrowing limit they give you. A good rule of thumb is probably to stay below half of the borrowing limit they give you. So if they'll let you borrow up to 50% the value of your portfolio, don't borrow more than 25%. That way the market would have to tank by 50% for your loan to get called, and that's very unlikely to happen. 

You need to do a calculation comparing the interest you would pay *on the full amount* you need to borrow over the time period you need to borrow vs the tax you would pay *only on the capital gains*.

People say after 100k, things get easier, so are they saying 100k all in just investment accounts or all accounts. including bank accounts? Between 401k and Roth IRA, I have just 70k total but combined with hysa and other bank accounts, I have 100k total. Is that it? Mathematically, only the 70k in investment account is actually working 
You’re splitting hairs, but the primary point is that $100K *invested* means your portfolio grows/shrinks in $1000 increments with 1% moves. 

This makes the impacts of portfolio growth, outside additional contributions, feel more significant. I'm at $200,000 for all accounts. Don't get me wrong, you see bigger increases, but losing $20,000 earlier this year didnt look pretty. You are still your main contributer at 100k, 200k, and I'm guessing 300k. I think the main reason people latch onto 100k is because it's the point where, for most people, your portfolio is generating more savings on its own than your contributions are. 

This community probably skews the data because we all save and invest aggressively, but your average person doesn't invest more than $10,000 of their own income per year. 

At average returns, 100k is generating 8-10k every year of passive wealth, meeting or surpassing your own contributions. That's why it ""explodes"" at 100k. 

There's nothing magical about 100 exactly, it's just a good round number to use as a milestone and an excellent goal to set for yourself. boohoo It also gets easier after the first billion 100k in the market is I believe what it is referred to. It’s basically a point where you start seeing enough of a return to start seeing the numbers grow a lot faster The numbers actually grow at the exact same rate. The growth rate is the same but 1% of 100k is more noticeable than 1% of 10k. This is the best and simplest explanation. End thread. $200k+ is about when you stop being the main contributor. 

My 401k is at $235k and the past year my gains were more than my contribution. It obviously depends on how well the market is doing but that’s about the point when it starts to tip. Our net worth is a little over 5M and 500k liquid and yet feel middle class.

The Turkish lira has breached the psychological threshold of 40 per US dollar. Historically, such levels have triggered panic, capital flight, and foreign divestment.

With no clear monetary tightening and inflation still high, is this a warning signal for investors holding Turkish stocks or bonds?

Would you reduce your exposure to emerging markets with unstable currency dynamics like Turkey?

Inflation is slightly getting better each year (35% now, from 80% in 2022), if Erdogan heeds to the orthodox policy advises, it will continue to get better. However, from the democratic standpoint, it's getting more authoritarian. He's got three more years. We'll see.

Hello everyone, for the record I am not Muslim and not interested in religion, I am just looking for decent stocks to buy that are not directly involved in supporting Israel and it's genocidal behavior. Meaning I will most probably not buy a Google Amazon Microsoft palantir etc... directly using their products to target and surveil civilians. But I am ok with companies that have no intentional involvement. If it doesn't officially state a boycott it's fine, if it's found in Israel but not intentionally, like an apple or Samsung phone, then it's fine too ! So I want to build a comprehensive list that is disengaged from Israel, not directly involved, but not necessarily actively engaged against Israel either... So for example Samsung, Novo nordisk and AMD would work ?? They are not actively supporting the genocide like Google, Microsoft, Palantir and BAE... 

Here come the bots 😂
Why only Israel?

Are you also boycotting companies that invest in Saudi Arabia or buy Saudi Arabian oil (look up what they've done in Yemen)? What about Chinese companies, for the crimes against humanity the Chinese Community Party are committing against the Uyghur Muslims? Would mean you would need to stop using most of your electronics, if you had consistent morals though surely you'd be willing to do that?  Or is this just a case of selective virtue signalling.... The population of gaza has grown since Oct 12.  Isreal is providing food directly to the people of Gaza since hamas was stealing it.  The only people calling for genocide (intafada) are muslims.

With your brainpower I would stick with VOO, QQQ, and the like. 🤡 clearly lol. Virtue signalling when it suits them, but nobody would give up their iPhones to protest the Chinese Communist Party. If iphone parts were manufactured in Israel nobody would be boycotting neither It's difficult to find something so specific, so I'm afraid you'll have to do your own research and select those values.

1lmjk0r,2025-06-28,"The stock jumped 280%, so I bought right away !!  Big mistake. Speculative Bubbles: The Troubling Case of Regencell Bioscience
**I’m writing this post as a warning to both beginners and seasoned investors: don’t fall for the “You Only Live Once” mindset.**

Lately, if you’ve been following the market, you’ve probably seen or heard of companies skyrocketing by over 1000% in just a few weeks or months   Regencell (RGC) being a prime example.

Using our screening tools, we noticed that **Regencell Bioscience (RGC)** surged more than **280%** right after its **38-for-1 reverse stock split** came into effect in early June 2025. Naturally, it’s tempting to jump in and buy — who wouldn’t be?

But here’s the catch: **it’s all smoke and mirrors.**

Dig a little deeper and here’s what you’ll find:

* **Regencell Bioscience**, based in Hong Kong and listed on the Nasdaq, **has no revenue**, **no marketed products**, **no regulatory approvals**, and **no patents**.
* They reported **net losses of $4.4 million in 2024** and **$6.1 million in 2023**, according to their filings.
* Their **Chief Medical Officer position has been vacant since 2022** — yes, you read that right, **since 2022**!

Even more alarming:

* Only **about 6% of the company’s shares are publicly tradable**. The CEO, **Yat-Gai Au**, owns **86% of the shares**, making the stock extremely volatile and easy to manipulate.
* Out of **500 million shares**, only **30 million are available** on the market.

The company’s “science” is based on **traditional herbal formulas** developed by the CEO’s father, with **no peer-reviewed publications** and **only internal trials**.

Now you might ask, *“But what’s the harm in taking the risk?”*

Here’s the real issue:  
The **Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)** — the watchdog for U.S. brokers — has repeatedly warned that **low-priced small-cap stocks are especially vulnerable to fraud**, including **pump-and-dump schemes**. These often involve hyped-up events like a stock split, used to lure in retail investors before insiders sell off their shares at inflated prices.

In **June 2025**, FINRA also moved to **redefine “foreign private issuers”**, potentially stripping some companies of the special status that allows them to avoid filing regular financial reports or disclosing insider trades.

So, before you invest in a **penny stock**, **do your research**. It may take time, but it could **save your money**  and your **ears** (when your partner screams at you for losing it ;)  lol.. ).

I hope this post will help some people think twice before jumping immediately on a stock and making a mistake.

Hey, just got interested in investing now that I've built a small emergency fund. To preface ive read the getting started wiki.

Currently have 2k in the bank and by the end of this year I'm hoping it grows to 4k (a month of expenses.)  I'm also self paying for my partner (married) college and they are half way done.  Going to go into 401k mode once I have 4k in emergency fund. 

In the wiki it says you can invest many hours a month or a small amount of time...I'm looking to dip my feet in investing little at a time.  I can swing $50 to $100 a month starting.  

The wiki says an app isn't necessarily the way to look at it, you need to look into SEC backed brokerages. So I humbly ask for recommendations on a brokerage with an app that allows for small time retail investment.  Any help would be appreciated Any money you will absolutely need within the next few years should not be in the market.  Sooner or later the market's going to go down again, and it might not rebound as quickly. '

You also need to assess your real risk tolerance.  If you panic sold in April then your tolerance was very low - the question is if it happens again will you be able to stay the course or not?  If the next dip is going to make you want to rip your hair out then you should probably get out now or be ready to marinate in anguish. I'm currently at 313k spaxx, 162k fxaix in a brokerage acct. 117k fxaix in a rollover ira. I got scared by spy dip and sold about 200k worth of fxaix about 2 months ago but at least I didn't sell at a loss (only started buying into spy in July 2024). Now I've just been leaving paycheks in spaxx and feeling fomo cause apparently the market is just fine. 
I'm 32. Saving the cash for a down payment on a house plus a small business loan in the next year (est Sept 2026). I anticipate total of both loans about 1.5 m. Am I doing it wrong by holding on to so much cash? Should I buy back in to the market? Schwab, Fidelity, Robinhood would be my recommendations.

You can also search for ""paper trading"" websites and apps. Those let you do virtual trading with fake money, which can be a helpful learning experience and give you more ""money"" to work with in your portfolio. I like Fidelity but it doesn't super matter. You can put any amount of money at a time into mutual funds like FXAIX, FZROX, FZILX or buy fractional shares of ETFs (slightly more of a hassle) like IVV, ITOT, IXUS. Keep the house downpayment in SGOV. Put the rest into a more bond-heavy portfolio this time, 'cause that was hardly anything (imagine the same amount of doom and gloom for but _years_). > 313k spaxx

Why wouldn't you put that in SP**R**XX or FZDXX?

1lmh8uc,2025-06-28,"IMF Confirms China's Real Deficit Is 13.2%, Not the 3% Beijing Claims
China’s true deficit isn’t 3%. It’s 13.2%. And it’s been that high for over a decade.

Buried in the IMF’s 2024 Article IV report is the augmented deficit, there effort to reflect China’s *actual* fiscal position by including hidden off-budget borrowing, mainly through local government financing vehicles (LGFVs). The number? 13.2% of GDP in 2024.

That’s on par with the U.S. deficit at the height of COVID (15% in 2020), almost double the very high \~7% the U.S. runs today. But China’s been quietly running deficits at this level every year for over a decade.

The IMF created this metric because China’s official figures ignore quasi-fiscal activity by local governments. These borrowings fund a wide range of public goods such as infrastructure, transport, housing, utilities,etc - but are labeled as “corporate debt,” so they don’t show up in the national budget. The augmented deficit adjusts for this and puts China on an apples-to-apples footing with OECD fiscal reporting, where this kind of spending is always captured.

# The Proof:

* [IMF 2024 Article IV](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2024/08/01/Peoples-Republic-of-China-2024-Article-IV-Consultation-Press-Release-Staff-Report-and-552803): 13.2% augmented deficit explicitly stated on page 3.
* [Bank of Finland](https://www.bofit.fi/en/monitoring/weekly/2024/vw202408_1/) (April 2024): 13% deficit for 2024, expecting 14%+ in 2025.
* [The Economist in 2016](https://archive.is/toxIg): Cited IMF data showing \~10% deficit driven by LGFV borrowing post-2008
* [2013 IMF (David Lipton):](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/28/04/54/tr052913) Deputy Managing Director stated China's true deficit was ""In the order of 10% of GDP"" once off-budget activity included.
* [LGFV debt has quintupled since 2012: ](https://www.crugroup.com/en/communities/thought-leadership/2024/china-navigates-debt-restructuring-ahead-of-trump-20/)From 13.5 trillion to 70 trillion yuan
* [Peterson Institute (March 2024)](https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/2024/chinas-official-deficit-no-longer-meaningful-measure-its-budget-system): ""China's official deficit is no longer a meaningful measure""

# Other interesting items from IMF report...

* China's augmented public debt was actually 124% of GDP in 2024, eclipsing [US levels of 120%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GFDEGDQ188S).
* Projected GDP growth in 2029: 3.3% with the deficit still 12.2%
* Fiscal revenues peaked in 2021 and are now declining, unprecedented for a major economy. For reference, U.S. federal revenues expected to grow abou[t 60% by 2035.](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-01/60870-By-the-Numbers.pdf)

To be clear, this isn’t hidden data. China openly reports its Total Social Financing, which captures this borrowing (though it’s disguised as “corporate”). And the IMF publicly publishes the augmented numbers. they’re just buried in footnotes.

No idea what to do with this information. 
Unlike the US, this is actually internal debt. They have no external creditor and they cannot default. They can restructure and do a bunch of accounting magic to make this dissapear if they want. This is also well known(per your 10 year old reference) and completely priced in

Op blocked me and I can't make comments in this post anymore: 

Internal debt - us creditors are 2/3 independent entities (pension/mutual funds, foreign governments, banks, individuals). While a large portion is internal as in owed within the US, its not under the actual gov control. By comparison, China's debt is 95%+ completely controlled by the gov (because the banks are state owned), and they have the ability to modify it in ways the US cannot > Op blocked me and I can't make comments in this post anymore: 

Lol, what a deceitful place reddit has become. One could easily think they participate in a dialogue, when in fact one hears a carefully constructed collage of prefered voices and arbitrarily selected soundbites. >China’s true deficit isn’t 3%. It’s 13.2%. **And it’s been that high for over a decade.**

So there's nothing to worry about; emphasis mine.

>No idea what to do with this information.

If you can't understand the *several decades* of false ""China will fail"" narratives, you should not be making financial decisions based on that understanding. Yep.  This is why the downvote censoring drives me nuts. God forbid you provide an alternate view point that goes against the status quo of the echo chamber. most US debt is 'internal debt' too. OP is posting this everywhere with tons of vapid comments, it is funny watching him get called out in multiple posts though :) Internal in this context refers to under government control. While much of US debt is held by Americans and American entities they aren't under government control like China's debt which is owned by mostly nationalized assets. I gave you a dozen different points and that's the best response you can come up with? Looks like you can't handle your ideas being challenged

T. They have a dozen different ways to deal with that debt(because they own it themselves). Go ask chatgpt if you want someone to explain economics to you Japan's lost decade is a direct result of the Pax Americana and the Plaza accords injecting that free central banker money into their economy. China has not bent the knee to the US and has complete control over their banks and currency 

China's debt ratio is normal when you consider it's being used for actual infrastructure, you'd see similar figures for the interstate system in the US. You'd expect the returns on this spending to occur over the long term. A fun figure is their solar implementation and cost of energy over time. What kind of economic opportunities open up when your electricity is free and infinite?

1lmezya,2025-06-28,"Would you buy NVDA AMD AMZN NFLX now?
These stocks are at ATH or at least up there somewhere.  Would you get in now or wait to buy the dip? And if you’re already holding, should you sell and wait for the dip and get back in?  I know you’re not supposed to time the market but there’s a good chance that they’ll dip lower than current prices at some point, what are your thoughts?
No, its the weekend markets are closed I don't sell anymore. I sold 30 of my 36 Nvidia shares pre the 1 to 10 and 1 to 4 split. Never again. And if I’d bought Amazon I would be in Venice with Jeff right now. All of which is a good argument for ETFs of course. AMD is not ATH. Winning stock keeps to be at ATH. Question: can they deliver more growth? Don’t know if this helps or not but I have young kids (<2). Buying for them makes me not worry about ATHs, I wish my parents had bought Apple or msft or something when they were at an ath in the 80’s or 90’s.

1lmemrm,2025-06-28,"If you bought TSLA close to $500 are you still holding onto it?
Jusr curious, did you happen to buy TSLA when it was trading close to $500? If so, are you still holding onto it, or did you decide to sell at some point? I’d love to hear your thoughts on how you’re feeling about it now, especially with how the stock has been performing lately.  Are you hopeful it’ll go back up soon?
Narrative stocks aren't worth it bro in what universe can we justify Tesla's P/E? Full EV dominance? They're not even close. It's great for speculative stocks in bull markets but next bear market Tesla is probably going to be $100. I mean you’re wrong on so many levels… I work in the autonomous space and Waymo isn’t even in the same league as far as quality goes - it’s far superior. The jury is very much still out on whether Tesla can pull off FSD with only cameras. So far, it’s not looking great…their pilot was clearly rushed with only 5-10 cars on the road, an employee in the car, and a number of problematic moves in the first day. Their cars also cannot operate in poor weather - best of luck to them on making cameras work when there’s literally things blocking them. 

My hunch is that LiDAR will continue to drop in price (down 90% since 2915) and Tesla will be forced to adopt it to meet regulatory standards, who knows how long elons hubris will prevent them from accepting that, though

I think the reality is that, if you own FSD (as I do) or have taken a robotaxi, you know that stuff isn’t good enough to be completely unsupervised. Even cruise, for all their efforts, only took 1 shady accident to sink the entire company and relying on only cameras makes that a not if but when They’re far behind Waymo on robotaxi… robotic? 😂 Oh now it makes more sense. If I had made a few million off of tesla I’d be in here spouting delusional takes as well. You don’t need to tell me anything cause I don’t value an opinion of a moron who thinks cameras alone is better than lidar, radar and camera combined. FSD this, FSD that. If you’re family with programming, then you would know “garbage in, garbage out.” Doesn’t matter how the stock is performing. It only matters how the company is doing, and things haven’t gone too good lately. Tesla is however a meme stock, but $500 is a tall order even for Tesla. 

Ask yourself, if you liquidated your position today, would you still buy Tesla tomorrow? If not, sell it all! The whole world hates Elon Musk.  You should sell and keep what you have left and make more informed stock purchases in the future.  Best of luck. How can you explain the sudden continuing falling sales of Tesla after Elon got involved with the Mango? It peaked at $488 in December, when there were still some delusions that he would have a long-term role in the current admin.  Except Waymo is significantly safer to ride in because of all the features you just mentioned.

1lmdlzu,2025-06-28,"Have I messed up by lump summing?
I recently rolled over my retirement accounts from a previous brokerage, and the funds transferred as cash. I’ve since reinvested the full amount, primarily into index funds, but I’m starting to question the timing. With markets near all-time highs, I’m wondering if lump summing the entire amount right away was the best move.
If that money was already invested previously it’s just essentially a transfer. Was probably the best move to lump sum it. You're good.  You won't be able to time it right at better than a 25% chance anyways You just transferred funds, its not really a lump sum investment. Would you have felt better waiting for a week, desperately hoping for a few % discount? Or maybe you would have DCA’d it over a few weeks, and hoped it didnt go up in that time as you would’ve missed out on gains?

I know i, and many others, wouldnt like that stress, and statistically what you did was the best option. Time in the market beats timing the market

Dont worry brother, even if it dips now in 20+ years it’ll be a drop in the bucket Sounds like you laterally moved money at near the same price.

1lmdjej,2025-06-28,"A large gap between economics and stock market
I come from an economics background and slowly got into the stock market overtime. At first, I believed that economics would have great impact on the stock market only to realize that while both work in tandem, the stock market seems delayed to effects of economics or some investors actually ignore the economics all together. 

Putting economics in my analysis is helpful but I'm curious is if you guys incorporate economics into your research and how?
Yes I do, often at odds with this sub. If 2008 taught us anything, the economy will eventually hit the stock market. The problem you can never tell when or entirely how. Its a waste of time just buy and hold good/undervalued companies you will do fine 100%, when people say the market, nowadays they mean the S&P500, which are the largest 500 companies in the US. These companies arent that impacted by the lower 50% income earners. If you look at the Russell 2000 on the other hand, small caps have been in a bear market for close to 4 years now, thats where your impact from lower income earners are showing in the stock market It’s not just delayed, sometimes accelerated. The market speculates on what the future will be (accelerated), which is what you saw this spring. The delay you are talking about is when the market misspeculates and gets it wrong. Basically the stock market doesn’t care too much about the woes of at least the lower half in the US because they don’t have much of an impact on earnings. Not that they don’t care about the people, it’s just that they don’t have an impact on companies returning capital to investors. So, all these people saying that the stock market is going to get its comeuppance as a significant portion of the economy is suffering, just doesn’t understand why the number keeps going up. Someday, college Econ and Finance professors will be using the meme stock era and companies like Microstrategy as wild examples in lectures.  Students will shake their heads and try to understand how dumb people could be…just like we do now with the dot.com bubble, and the housing bubble/mortgage crisis.

As investors, many of us have a VERY strong suspicion that the collapse will be dramatic and wipe out a lot of value…the problem is that we don’t know the timing.  It could be Monday morning.  It could be 10 years from now. Actually thinking about it, it's deeper than consumer spending, it's consumer sentiment at the working and middle classes. 


It's very clear to those of us who are living paycheck to pay check that things are getting really bad. This is the group who don't have investment portfolios, who didn't get the increase in wealth for the last several years. They have no cushion, and their incomes are increasingly being squeezed for basics. The CPIs might say inflation hasn't been that high, but housing and insurance have been astronomical (conveniently, these are spending metrics that are left out of CPIs, at least in my country) 


Their disposable income is nearly non-existant. Their incomes haven't kept up, and homelessness is rising. Household budgets have absolutely no fat in them, which is being masked by credit cards and afterpay.


As I said somewhere else recently, our economy isn't capitalist, it's consumerist. When consumers can't consume because they can't afford to, it won't be long until that hits P/E statements.  It depends on what signals are popping up. Right now it's consumer spending. But I also don't think the Republican party as a whole should be underestimated. They've been very clear about what they want to achieve, and so far they're getting it.

Hi all, 

So I really want to start investing my money. 
My husband and I earn about 350- 400k between us per year. And have work cars. We currently have one investment property that is causing some problems so we are going to fix it up and sell it and we will have enough money to pay off our mortgage. So we will have even less expenses. 

From there we will be starting fresh with no debts but no investments. We also have a fair bit of cash sitting in the bank and are good savers. I want to grow my money but dont really know where to start. Everyone says ""do your own research"" about stocks. What research and where do I do this. Or should I stick with property and once I sell this one off buy more investment properties? 

Are there any good podcasts or tools that can help with investing or does anyone have any advice? We both work really hard for the money we do have with stressful jobs so id like the make the money I've earnt worthwhile and do something with it. 
Theres are links to educational resources in the wiki. Look on the sidebar.

Podcasts/videos - [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/medialist/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/medialist/) Sounds like you could use an advisor. Make sure they are a CFP fiduciary and that their fees aren’t too high. Then make sure they get you into an age-appropriate blend of diversified low fee funds of stocks and fixed income. Then forget about about it! you make 400k and you have no investments?  How old are you? The Joseph Carlson show  Yeah okay I will look into advisors thanks 32. I have an owner occupier property and an investment property. We didnt always make that much thats just what we make now. Have also spent a lottt on traveling (plus a wedding 😬😬) so now that we are on higher salaries we want to know how to use the money wisely. Almost all advisors have monetary conflicts of interest, unfortunately.

1lmdhux,2025-06-28,"Investing in SWYHX, with my Roth, worried it's too conservative for my situation: should I switch?
 I have the SWYHX  a Target date of 2045 in my Roth account, and  I'm worried about it being way too conservative as I get older.  I'm low income and I just started saving into a Roth in 2023, I usually put $500 a month in,  and I'm 48 now. I'm scared I won't have anything close to what I need to retire and will most likely be working until my late 80s . My dad is 70 now and lost a lot of money in his 401k during the bubble bust and now has only about 10 years worth of retirement funds. 

Not sure if I should dump this retirement stock for something that will give me a healthier risk even up to retirement, but I don't know anything about investing. I only got this stock because people recommended it as dummy easy investing for retirement. 

But I've read that these funds are way too conservative as you get closer to retirement date when you still need riskier investments vs Cash bonds etc. 

Any ideas? I wanted something I can just put money in each month and not look at it for 20 years or so. 

Should I just switch to the S&P500 for the next 15 years and add some bonds later on? 

Also should I be checking my fund every few years to see if it's losing money ?  Not even sure how to do this on the Schwab app. 
VOO and automatically reinvest dividends. Don’t sell. Don’t look at it. Just keep filling up your Roth with it. Btw I see that  The SWYHX Index I'm in now has a Gross expense ratio of %0.13 and a Net expense ratio of %0.08.

0.13 seems kind of high isn't it, though it is a No Load/No Fee fund I would not say TDFs put people in too conservative of portfolios when they're close to retirement, no. They're designed to avoid [sequence of returns risk](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/timing-matters-understanding-sequence-returns-risk), which is what you saw with your dad. 

In your case, it sounds like you _need_ the risk. Here's the rough way I'd think about it: you can choose between: 

* 100% chance of not retiring due to not saving enough, or
* 50% chance of not retiring due to the market crashing

Whatever the number for the second one is, it's better than 0, yes?

The easiest move is probably to just switch to a later date TDF. You can also switch to a more static allocation if you want; I would do that via [a managed fund](https://www.schwab.com/mutual-funds/types/asset-allocation-mutual-funds) (https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/product-brief/ishares-core-esg-allocation-brief.pdf, or https://www.schwab.com/mutual-funds/invest-in-a-portfolio-solution) for simplicity's sake. I don't really know anything about ETFs.
I currently have a about $13,800 in my fund and I see the VOO is $565. Is this $565 a share? 
If I Invest $500 , I'm just buying a tiny piece of the share right? 
I'm not sure I want to completely put all my cash in the S&P though because it's less diverse than what I have now. 
I'd like to invest in different markets but I don't know how to rebalance my portfolio every year or so when needed.

The VOO feed do look a lot less than what I pay now Anything under 20 basis points (0.20%) is generally fine. Plenty of great quality target date funds exist in the 10-18 BP range.

The more important variable right now is asset allocation. Your 2045 fund is ~15% bonds which generally grow less than stocks over the long term. 

For the next 10 years you are probably better off just holding a global stock fund like VT. No, it's very low. ""High"" is 0.5, 1.0, 1.5% type of stuff. 

The gross expense ratio is what you're actually paying. That'll only cost you about 5% of your portfolio in total over fifty years: https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/How_much_do_you_lose_to_annual_fees_after_many_years%3F I'm not sure what ""Static"" means in this case. (NEVERMIND I JUST GOOGLED IT) 

Someone mentioned moving my TDF up to a further future date but said even then it was more conservative than they liked . 


I just looked at the I-Shares chart and the AOA - aggressive looks interesting because it has a lot of S&P and also international stuff but a little bit of bonds. I'm assuming this is more to the riskier side than what I have now? Which I don't mind. I assume I can always switch to a 60/40, 20 years down the line or even hire someone to look at it at that point?

It looks like this would be similar to putting it all into a VOO type ETF except it has some of the International stuff that I like for diversification. 

I'm torn between something like this and a straight VOO type. 
Maybe keeping either for 15 yrs and then hiring a one time adviser to look it over? 

I have the willpower to just leave it alone for that long so I'm not worried about getting scared of it goes down. My dad's situation was his crash happened closer to retirement and he never really recovered .

Everything I read says that Manager funds just aren't worth the fees they charge . I guess I could pick my own funds but I don't really know how to re-adjust them during the years. VOO (or SPY, or VTI) has a historically high return and moderate to low risk factor. Most experts will tell you it’s the only thing most people should invest in.  If I'm trying to grow as much as possible within the next 20 I don't really need Bonds at this point right?

1lmcqk9,2025-06-28,"Will growth continue to outperform value over the next decade?
We're headed towards an inflection point.

The 4th Industrial Revolution ushered in by AI and anchored by companies like Nvidia.

The number of AI-related companies continue to grow exponentially in the private markets with many coming to the public markets later this year.

The S-curve of technological innovation is at hand.

We're still in the early stages of this S-curve for AI.

It's hard to imagine growth not continuing to dominate value on an relative basis until we are past the inflection point and at the part of the curve of diminishing returns.

This could take another decade.

I understand there are cycles between value and growth, but it appears this growth cycle is much longer than what many have anticipated.

Perhaps we should heed Keynes advice that ""when the facts change, I change my mind.""
Nobody knows nothing. Stay the course. Let me check my crystal ball.. At some point AI will have to deliver profitable product. Right now all we have is hype. I’m invested 50% S&P500, 30% Growth (IWF), the rest in private equity and value oriented. I increased my growth exposure this year and might continue to add to it. Is testfol a pet project or is it legit for analysis? Agree on diversification and disagree on performance. IWF is mirroring the Russell 1000 Growth. While the S&P500 has a performance of +197% in the last 10 years. IWF had a performance of +324%.

See here: https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/fund-performance?s=y&sl=1IxZUGchSXMHzjq3RZmJR5 I'm not sure, but I think the work landscape will change drastically in the next 10 years. Similar to how the 2000s change wildly with e-commerce and how the 2010s was shaped by smart phones, 2020s is the start of AI. No longer will companies need to hire x people, those x people will find different jobs that are formed from AI.  Realize that the S&P is largely growth. If you’re trying for diversity you’re not getting much between SPY and IWF. They are highly correlated, the major holdings largely overlap,  and returns are very similar. https://testfol.io/analysis?s=4r9NgIHHGmd It is legit, you can also use: https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/analysis Hey you’re right.

1lmaqaz,2025-06-28,"Advice for a 17 year old?
I recently received an invariance of $35,000 and I’m looking to invest it. What would be my best course of action? My personal finance teacher suggested qqq and CD’s since i would be holding it for at least 5 years. What do you guys think? I don’t want it to just sit in my account doing nothing. Any advice is greatly appreciated.
You should fire your personal finance teacher for suggesting QQQ(M). They really shouldn’t be giving this kind of advice. QQQ is a higher expense ratio version of QQQM. Both of those are a marketing gimmick by the NASDAQ. There’s no reason to want just 100 arbitrarily selected non-financials that trade just on the NASDAQ. 

But, 5 years isn’t a long timeframe in investing. You might want to look for HYSA, CD, SGOV, treasuries, and those kinds of things. The full explanation is too long to type here. The short version is you're 17. That is actually a superpower.

Investing returns are a combination of 3 factors: money invested, risk taken, and time. The more of one, the less you need of the others. At 17, you've got a shitload of time.

Go to /r/bogleheads. Follow their advice. Don't touch the money for the next few decades, other than to maybe add to your investments here and there. You'll be in amazing shape as an adult. I’d open & max out your Roth IRA (id read bogle’s little book of common sense investing OR go to r/bogleheads and read the wiki), I’d also look into opening a HYSA (high yield savings account) right now capital one offers around 3.6% apy. This isn’t advice, just food for thought 5 years is an insignificant period of time when analyzing performance. QQQ(M) is just 100 stocks that trade just on the NASDAQ and it doesn’t include financials. It also includes Pepsi but not coke because that’s what trades on the NASDAQ. I’m not sure why anyone would want that. These kinds of risks are called “uncompensated risks.” Anyway, if these 100 companies do well then they do really well, but if they stop doing well then it crashes hard. Generally speaking you don’t want this kind of volatility. If you truly want to invest this money, and you should, then you want VTI (a vanguard product) or FSKAX (a fidelity product) or SCHB (a Schwab product). Which brokerage are you using? OP can go very wrong with QQQM.

A great way to avoid paying taxes is to not make any money 👍👍👍👍👍🤡 Actually, try reaching out to Wesley Snipes for tips on this. You have to pay taxes on everything. It's just how it works. Parking money in an investment and gaining money isn't blood, sweat, and tears. The government wants a piece of it.

Obviously munis, treasuries, etc are the least taxed. they tax you on earning money through blood sweat and tears too though… So you want to get rich quick and not pay any taxes?  I swear I see people so concerned about taxes that they’d rather make $40k and pay $5k in taxes than make $200k and pay $30k in taxes because they saved $25k in taxes. That’s not true. Dividends in taxable brokerage accounts are subject to tax if you reinvest or not. muni bonds are the only thing I've never understood the brackets for LTCG.  If your income is under $48k you pay 0%.  

Can I cash out $100k of equities and pay $0 tax if I make $45k that year? The important number is the gain, not the amount sold


If you had 0 income and sold stocks for $100k that you originally got for $55k (ie $45k gain) then sure, your income is 45k and you're taxed accordingly

Inflation is a risk that borders on certainty. Find a trustworthy financial advisor. You shouldn’t be managing money. This is no insult.

You’re robbing your children by not investing in things that at least have a chance of outpacing inflation. You should live at least three doublings of the capital. Basically short term treasuries , you can buy yourself or simply buy a fund like VBIL or SGOV 20 yr us bond has almost 5% rate ah yes the classic how to get rich but like, safely Hello,

If I understand correctly, you would like over 4 % risk free.

For that I personally use the government bonds. There is one with over 5% and you can buy and sell it any time(depending on what broker you use. The coupons were yearly if I remember correctly.

I am not at my trading station now so I cant look them up at the moment.

No neighbours etc... 20 year treasury is where it's at!  lock in the mostly tax free 5% Government or AAA corporate bonds probably your best bet. Anything with higher yield than that will likely involve some tangible risk Unfortunately how much you need to earn is a very nuanced question and because you want as little risk as possible (zero risk is impossible outside of a HYSA but we can get it extremely close) and we also don’t know any details (your cost of living and that sort of info). Your best bet is likely money market funds if you just want to protect principle but still earn interest you can live off of. They pay yield monthly and depending on the ones you select, you may get partial or total tax exemption. Otherwise they are very similar to a HYSA If you are planning to leave the balance to your kids presumably 20+ years from now, why would you want no risk? Sounds like a pretty long time-horizon. \>>Hire a professional

The problem with that is many 'professionals' just push their own products with a nice kick-back from the fund they're pushing. I would say most registered financial advisers behave this way.

1lm6ob9,2025-06-27,"Treasury Bond (actual) vs T-Bond ETF question
Not a fixed income person, so I can't quite do this in my head.

Assume the holding period is 3 years during a declining rate environment.

So you buy a 10 year Treasury Bond.

Your interest payment is the same every time.

As rates decline, the bond price appreciates.

I know (or think) there's no actual 10-year-only Treasury ETF, but say there was.  Pays monthly.

The ETF has portfolio turnover, so as rates decline the monthly div declines.

The price should appreciate, but because of the effect of turnover, it won't match the appreciation of the single bond.

Is that correct?  Do you inevitably give up some return by owning the ETF instead of the bond itself?

**Pre-editing to add:** OK one flaw in my question is that the ETF portfolio has stuff that's older than any single recent interest rate trend.  So pretend you managed to top-tick rates for the next 3 years on the day you bought the bond or ETF.
Not quite, the bond ETF is essentially DCA'ing the yield curve. Old bonds roll off as they mature and new bonds at current rates get added on.

The net duration exposure can be measured by the ""effective duration"", this is important because you can buy 20+ yr bonds that have coupons in a fund like TLT, but your effective duration is like 16 years because money gradually gets paid out to the investor. On the flipside, if you bought a fund that buys 20-30yr STRIPS (zero coupon bonds), you get the full duration exposure of the bond maturity, like GOVZ/ZROZ have an effective duration of 27ish yrs, averaging out their 30 yr strips and 20yr and everything inbetween.

The ETF closest to what youre looking for is IEF, at 7.05 yrs effective duration.

However, as new yields drop, youll be buying new lower yield bonds in IEF, but the existing bonds on IEFs balance sheet will increase in value since they have higher yields.

Its all a gradual meshing of old fund contents and new fund contents, thus the ""DCA"" analogy. Old bonda roll off, new bonda roll in. You want the real thing if you are betting on bond appreciation. It’s very easy to buy treasuries if you so desire. Yeah.  What I don't like about the ETF is that the div payment will decline, whereas the actual bond payment won't.

And trying to figure out if the ETF price appreciation could he higher enough %-wise vs a bond itself to make up for that.  Instinct says no, but can't get data to do apples-to-apples because there's no pure X-duration ETFs. You are also eliminating counterparties by bypassing the etf. If shit falls off a cliff like 2008 then counterparty risk becomes a real thing. And if you’re expecting rapid reductions in interest rates, one reason for that to happen would be a massive recession or some systemic risk metastasizing. >Is that correct? Do you inevitably give up some return by owning the ETF instead of the bond itself?  

No. The change in price with respect to change in yield is called duration. A ten year individual bond has a duration of 8.5ish years, same as an ETF holding only that bond or holding bonds with an average 10 year maturity.  

If yields fall at the start of the 3 years, the return would be the same.  

If yields fall gradually, the ETF would return more because it maintains an 8.5 year duration while the individual bond gradually approaches maturity and falls in duration, meaning it rises less with falling yields.  

In both cases, the yield falls. That's because the price is higher, not because coupons fell. The change in dividend paid out per share will change at a pace tied to the average duration. The dividends for long term bond etfs are very, very stable. The change in yield comes about through change in price. It is too early for me to fully understand what you're asking, but have you read https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Individual_bonds_vs_a_bond_fund ? Many things people talk about are actually constant versus decreasing duration. 

You can get constant duration individual bonds via a ladder (though at small amounts, you'll have uninvested coupon payments). And you can now get decreasing duration bond funds from ishares: https://www.ishares.com/us/strategies/bond-etfs/build-better-bond-ladders

1lm6lc1,2025-06-27,"401k Rollover Investment Plan
Hello! I just got laid off from my job and am going to be rolling my company's 401k over into my Fidelity Traditional IRA account very soon. Right now I am investing about 80% in VOO and 20% into VXUS in my Fidelity Roth IRA account. I have a Traditional IRA Account that I don't really contribute into. 
Im 26 years old. 
Should I stick to my investment plan I am currently using for my Roth IRA? Or should I do something different? I'm not very educated when it comes to investing, but I am doing my best to learn. 
Thank you in advance! 

>Should I stick to my investment plan I am currently using for my Roth IRA?

I would be perfectly fine with it. The 20% International is exactly what I would do. Though I prefer VTI over VOO, the difference is minimal (so much so that I wouldn't argue the point either way).

Best of luck to you on your next job (today's misfortune might turn into a blessing in the future). Just administrative advice.  Have Fidelity ""pull"" the 401k.  Let them go get it.  Try to avoid talking to the current 401k administrator.  

The risk is that if you simply tell the 401k administrator that you want to rollover the 401k they might send you a check made out in your name with 20% withheld for taxes -- and that is just the start of that mess.

If a check is going to be sent to you it needs to be made out to the receiving institution FBO [your name].  FBO is ""For the Benefit Of"".  Fidelity will tell you how to manage this. Thank you! Out of curiosity, why do you prefer VTI? I just like that VTI includes small and mid cap stocks at the market weight, but VTI and VOO perform close to each other since small/mid cap stocks only make up a small percentage of VTI.

Sometimes people concentrate too much of their energy in picking investments (I did too at one point), but what really makes a difference is concentrating on How Much They Are Investing. Consistently investing and increasing the percentage of your income invest is so much more important and impactful to your investment success than nitpicking too much over which investments to select.

Short term capital gains are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate. So - it depends on your income. It is why it can be more tax efficient to have long-term gains for many investors when possible. Ok, so a short term gain then. So you had a $2 gain per share plus the premium per share minus your transaction fees which gives you the total capital gain. Whether it is long or short depends on how long you held the stock. The short call is a wash. So the $400 from writing the call is added to the proceeds of the sale. And the taxable amount is difference between the cost basis and proceeds+premium.

So - ($13,200 + 400) - (13000) = $600.

So your taxable amount is $600.

S&P is up 12.6% for 1 year and 5% YTD, that's a solid return Yes, go find good deals.  Good deals aren’t stuck behind a border. Am European so that 5% is more like -10% if we take the nosedive of USD valuation itself into account. 

That loss of value is ofcourse also real for you guys, but you don’t really see it so one can pretend it’s not real. Nah always lump sum at the very peak of the market like Reddit tells you to Dollar devaluation, hello??

Returns are good, though, but come on, it's easy for Americans not to notice but it's less fun for everyone who got 13-15% of their investment value deleted (unless the dollar appreciates, which seems suuuuuper likely given Trump's policies about devaluation). Thankfully I got in right at the bottom, but for example I know people who got 50-100k USD thanos snapped out of existence for the time being, at least.

Again, don't get me wrong, I'm 2/3rds invested in the US in terms of portfolio weight, I just think not mentioning the huge devaluation is kinda wild. Shouldn’t you buy when an asset is down? VXUS is up 14.5% over the last year vs VOO up 12.5%

That ETF tracks a fund in USD, but the price is listed in EUR. The iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS ETF holds the same U.S. stocks as the index, but its share price is quoted on European exchanges. Over the last 12 months the dollar has fallen roughly 8-10 % against the euro and sterling as trade-war worries eased and the Fed signalled easier policy. ￼ ￼

That single FX swing can turn a +12 % move in the USD index into a mid-single-digit gain—or even a loss—in EUR/GBP terms. A hedged share class (e.g. CSPX Hedged EUR) would remove this effect.

1lm22an,2025-06-27,"I need some advice on fixed-income ETFs
So SPY has been really great and has made me some good money. I am always looking for ways to diversify my portfolio and bring in passive income. Can someone explain how fixed-income ETFs work vs other types of ETFs? Like is this a set it and forget it type of situation like SPY is or do they have a shelf life like CD's and Treasury Notes where I will need to remember to sell it? ( I look at my account almost daily so I'm not actually forgetting about it. More needing to know if this is more of a short-term investing rather than long term) 
Most (not all) will keep somewhat a constant duration so they are basically set and forget

Meaning if you buy some intermediate term bond ETF it will have some constant duration of something like 5-7 years and stay that way

You can hold it for 20 years as internally it will sell bonds as they drop off and buy bonds to give some average duration of 5-7 years

However there are some newer ishares ETFs called iBonds (not to be confused with the inflation linked treasury bonds ) that will have some maturity date.

Meaning these will have lower duration the longer you hold them sort of like holding an actual bond Closer to set and forget, but you have to watch to look for any that shift to a sell rating. I use [morningstar.com](http://morningstar.com) ratings for every purchase decision, funds, stocks and ETFs. The ones I added to our portfolio after retirement were all well rated. Morningstar Premium is available at your library or for a few hundred a year subscription. 

I own these short term bond funds (I don't own any other bonds): SKOR, PULS, FLRN

And these derivative income funds: CCI, AMT, STAG, AMZY

You may also consider some dividend choices: VIG,  VYM, VYMI, MLPX Thanks for that explanation. That makes a lot of sense and clears up my confusion as to how they work. Seems like I may want to stay away from the iBonds as this is for my IRA accounts. I was looking at some Eaton Vance ones and am not sure which ones are actually good. Do you have any recommendations on specific fixed-income ETFs? Fixed-Income ETFs are good but DO require cyclical management....they are not set and forget; they are also not Value-Based products, meaning the Value is not in the strike but the Distributions.  Almost all the good ones are 1x Leveraged...the great ones are 2-3x but annual distributions (so Day-trader products).

\----

If you want comfort without management, look into Preferred Stocks (no DRIP)....make sure you buy in less than its Face Value (FV).  

For instance, 

>$STRK is currently at a $5-6 Premium ($105.68/sh), it has a $100 FV; however, it pays $8/yr (8% \* FV) with a quarter distribution of $2; Technically you would have recovered the Premium after the 3rd quarter and it is Perpetual with no real Call Data, it has a Earliest Call Date.  


>$SOJD is currently at a $5+/- Discount ($19.93/sh), it has a $25 FV, pays out 1.2375 (4.95% \* FV) each year with distributions quarterly (0.309375/qtr); It has a Call Date of 1/30/2080, yes 2-0-8-0

You need to assess your own risk and ability to manage, that will identify which instruments you choose.

LETFs can exceed 70% ROI in a single year; MSTY is on track to be 130-160% Yield.....Their caveat is NAV erosion if mismanaged or their strategy is too weak for the holdings IV. most brokerages will let you set up automatic buying on CD's, I've never played around to much with them but I know you can set it up that way.  

Bond funds and fixed income etfs generally hold an inverse relationship to interest rates, rates go up, bond fund values go down.  

Personally I like PFF which isn't really a bond fund but acts like one.  It's a preferred bank stock ETF and pays a better dividend rate than a lot of funds.  I find the preferred stock they hold to be better quality than whats held in a lot of other preferred stock etfs.  

If you want to mix it up and get dividend income, dividend etfs, CD's, bonds, REITS.  There are dual mandate ETFs which have a portion for growth with the bulk going to income producing, growth/income etfs. Thanks for this explanation. It's definitely helpful and points me in a direction for research. Thanks! I had no idea you could set up the automatic buying for CD's. I haven't personally ever invested in them but have been curious. I have O in my account (REIT). I think most of my stocks pay dividends. I'm gonna look into PFF and some dual mandate ETFs. I think I am creating balanced retirement accounts but I still want to find the best ways to create passive income/growth. YieldMax, Defiance, and REX are groups that i have investments.....my risk tolerance is high but i am also managing weekly, if not daily.  I have a very Data Analytics view on these products, so not typical FinTech numbers. ooo thanks! I'm gonna check these out. I do have a high-risk tolerance (currently holding RIVN hoping it will take off like TSLA and lost some on FSR-bad bet lol) but I also try to balance things out. I am checking the account daily to check gain/loss but not really doing much selling. Awesome! Thanks for the info. I have used morningstar for some purchase decisions also.

1lmmysh,2025-06-28,"Are my foreign gains inflated because dollar has been devalued?
Hi, in march i decided to switch to foreign stocks, to avoid the first year of trump volatility. I thought I was doing pretty well but am concerned that my gains aren’t real. A coworker told me that I’m only up because the dollar has been devalued and that once the dollar goes back up, I would lose most of my gains. Is this true? 

 Am I only up because dollar is worth less and as a result I’ve gotten higher gains? I’ve never really understood forex or how currency risk works, but I want to exit my position, if I’m going to lose money because of dollar reversal. 
Thank you for a great simplified explanation. At the beginning of the year 1 dollar was .95 euro. Let's keep it simple and say 1 to 1.

You own 1 share of euro company A. It's worth 100 euro since it's valued in Euro and purchased there with your mutual fund. It's valued in your portfolio in USD so 100 USD.

Fast forward to today, now 1 dollar is .85 euro. Let's assume the stock is flat. But now it will show as 117 USD 

Your friend is right, but also it doesn't account for the 96% gain. As the dollar weakens if you have foreign holdings their values when looking at USD also go up.vthats what for the last 20 years or so as the dollar has strengthened overseas people holding US stocks see bigger gains compared to US counterparts assuming the same stocks. Take a look at the chart for ""IUSA"". That's basically the same as SPY but denominated in EUR. It gives you a good overview about how the market is doing if you ignore the devalued dollar. 

If both your income and expenses are in USD I wouldn't worry about it too much, your gains in USD are absolutely real. 

For European investors however this sucks big time, we sold EUR to buy USD to buy the stock. Now if we sell the stock we get more USD, but that USD buys us less EUR. 

This can easily change though and in general if you invested dollars you should look at your dollar gains. 

We invested EUR and care about EUR gains. This doesn't really affect you. 

You did the opposite, bought EUR and used that to buy the stock. If the stock is flat but the USD goes down then you sell the stock for the same amount of Euros, it now means more dollars for you. 

This is what your mate is trying to explain. 

I think your gains are real, because this is called ""currency risk"" and you collected a premium on this risk. 

You invested dollars are now you have more dollars. That's what you should care about. In simple terms, when you are BUYING the stock in USD, you want your foreign currency to be as strong as possible. When you are SELLING the same USD stock, you want your foreign currency to be as weak as possible. Ahh gotcha. Thanks for the info. As long as the stocks grow at a decent pace, even if the dollar reverse I shouldn’t see a loss right? It would just be a lower gain? That's correct, it won't reverse all the way. Foreign stocks have grown a lot since many countries are focusing on their own companies. However foreign companies can also go down in value so could they eventually go down? Yes, but it won't be only from the dollar strengthening. You would need something crazy to happen like 1 dollar to be worth 2 euro all else being equal. Before making any decisions, I think it would be prudent to read the prospectus of your investment—you should do this before buying into *any* fund—and understand foreign currency risks and ways to mitigate it. Moreover, I think it's good practice to just have a plan and stick to it rather than try to anticipate or time market movements, e.g. ""I'll stay out of US equities for a year."" And being 90% or more international is... well, that's a choice. 

Also, nothing is ""real"" until you realize it. 🙂 Gains from foreign currency rates can be as real as anything else. And who is to say when the dollar will swing back up versus Foreign Currency X? Who is to say it doesn't drop further? 

In any event, foreign currency risk is a real thing, as many people are discovering lately. If you want to try to eliminate this, there *are* ETFs that hedge against exchange rate changes to neutralize that effect, but (a) it's not perfect, (b) it can be more expensive, (c) it eliminates the opportunities when you benefit from relative currency strength.

An example would be iShares Eurozone ETF's EZU (unhedged) and HEZU (hedged). While they're both up over the past 6 months, from March they diverge quite a bit. Unhedged is +24% in 6 months, hedged is +14%.",9,0.85,7,0,Drago_09,stockmarket,['C'],foreign gains inflated dollar devalued hi march decided switch foreign stocks avoid first year trump volatility thought pretty well concerned gains arent real coworker told im dollar devalued dollar goes back would lose gains true dollar worth less result ive gotten higher gains ive never really understood forex currency risk works want exit position im going lose money dollar reversal thank great simplified explanation beginning year 1 dollar 95 euro lets keep simple say 1 1 1 share euro company worth 100 euro since valued euro purchased mutual fund valued portfolio usd 100 usd fast forward today 1 dollar 85 euro lets assume stock flat show 117 usd friend right also doesnt account 96 gain dollar weakens foreign holdings values looking usd also go upvthats last 20 years dollar strengthened overseas people holding us stocks see bigger gains compared us counterparts assuming stocks take look chart iusa thats basically spy denominated eur gives good overview market ignore devalued dollar income expenses usd wouldnt worry much gains usd absolutely real european investors however sucks big time sold eur buy usd buy stock sell stock get usd usd buys us less eur easily change though general invested dollars look dollar gains invested eur care eur gains doesnt really affect opposite bought eur used buy stock stock flat usd goes sell stock amount euros means dollars mate trying explain think gains real called currency risk collected premium risk invested dollars dollars thats care simple terms buying stock usd want foreign currency strong possible selling usd stock want foreign currency weak possible ahh gotcha thanks info long stocks grow decent pace even dollar reverse shouldnt see loss right would lower gain thats correct wont reverse way foreign stocks grown lot since many countries focusing companies however foreign companies also go value could eventually go yes wont dollar strengthening would need something crazy happen like 1 dollar worth 2 euro else equal making decisions think would prudent read prospectus investmentyou buying fundand understand foreign currency risks ways mitigate moreover think good practice plan stick rather try anticipate time market movements eg ill stay us equities year 90 international well thats choice also nothing real realize gains foreign currency rates real anything else say dollar swing back versus foreign currency x say doesnt drop event foreign currency risk real thing many people discovering lately want try eliminate etfs hedge exchange rate changes neutralize effect perfect b expensive c eliminates opportunities benefit relative currency strength example would ishares eurozone etfs ezu unhedged hezu hedged theyre past 6 months march diverge quite bit unhedged 24 6 months hedged 14

	•	Intrinsic value (DCF-based): $71 to $75 according to models from ValueInvesting and GuruFocus
	•	P/E ratio: Around 8
	•	Return on Equity: Approximately 25 percent
	•	Dividend yield: Roughly 1.2 percent
	•	Earnings yield: Over 13 percent

United (UAL)
	•	Current price: $79
	•	Analyst target (avg): $95
	•	Intrinsic value (DCF-based): Varies between $120 and $160 depending on the method
	•	Conservative estimates based on free cash flow models show value closer to $60

	•	P/E ratio: About 7
	•	Return on Equity: Around 30 percent
	•	Dividend: Not currently paying, but has strong cash generation

Why I think these stocks are potentially undervalued
	•	Both DAL and UAL trade at a steep discount compared to their historical P/E and the market average
	•	Airline demand remains strong and both companies have recovered well post-pandemic
	•	ROE and cash flow metrics are solid for both, especially UAL
	•	DAL offers a modest but reliable dividend and consistent earnings
	•	Analyst targets show 20 to 60 percent upside potential depending on the model
I think you forgot the part where international tourism to the US is falling off a cliff Fundamentals, in this economy???!!! As is US tourism to other countries, what with the dollar getting decimated All those tourists deciding not to visit that fasc1st shithole to be detained for no reason?  A weakening USD, and huge outflow from US equities to stable democracies instead, yeah I'm bearish here Airlines are never undervalued because their fundamentals carry huge volatility risks. So you always have to review the risk balance especially hard. When delta was sub 20 it was a good time to invest. Now? Not so much but maybe still. Depends on whether you think growth will continue long enough for it to be justified. My rule on airlines is always to apply a 50% reduction in their revenues from their most recent high mark rolling 12 month without reducing their costs, and then set valuations appropriately from there. If its too rich at that level compared to S&P average metrics then its not a good time imo and there are other places to invest Do not ever buy airline stocks Airlines will be one of the first industries to tank when DJT drives the global economy into depression.  This time, the U.S. may be so far into debt that they actually won’t be able to give them a bailout. Airlines...not even once I invested in airlines believing seasonality would boost them some in summer (vacations) and more in winter (holidays). Been bag holding ever since. The FAA got mucked with. International tourism doesn't want to touch the US with a,10' pole with ICE running around. Plane crashes and system issues causing delays at air ports are black eyes on the industry. I think all the major airlines are interested in eVTOL as potential side businesses, but those won't be up snd running (much less profitable) for years. I'm hoping they go up in winter. But I'm gonna drop them when i can. The play didn't pan out as i was hoping. Lmao people actually do analysis and ""DCF"". 😂

 Washington – Beginning Monday, June 30, Canada’s digital services tax (DST) will take effect, requiring affected companies, predominantly leading U.S. technology firms, to pay up to $3 billion in payments, including retroactive charges dating back to 2022.  In the absence of a clear path to a negotiated solution,  the Computer & Communications Industry Association today called on the U.S. Trade Representative to open a 301 investigation, as a first step in resolving this trade dispute with Canada.

Beyond payments due June 30, U.S. firms will continue to be subject to  annual payments ranging into the billions of dollars.. The CCIA Research Center estimates these measures will lead to annual losses of between $900 million and US$2.3 billion for U.S. firms and could result in up to 3,000 U.S. job losses. The U.S. administration and Congress have determined that taxes of this nature are discriminatory and unjustified, and have called for their immediate repeal.
other countries are going to do the same digital tax on american companies.

its not safe for countries outside of the US to be using american software anymore, with how unhinged theyve been acting. hopefully this spurs on local alternatives I dont understand why it isn't a default. Why should digital services not have to pay tax on profit earned in the country the profit originated.

1llyvch,2025-06-27,"Stock market opens in record territory as investors bet on trade deals, Fed rate cut

It seems like the “trade deals” are less that and just keeping the tariffs where they are now. Which is suppose is better then higher but we have known for weeks that they were likely to push back negotiations for some countries so not sure why it’s causing more of a pump now.

Rate cuts I could see but I’m of two minds. We just saw inflation get revised upwards, but if the tariffs don’t change for a few months they may risk cutting the rates anyways even if inflation is still around 2.5%. Stagflation pretty much killed any rate cut hopes This definitely isn't sustainable long-term, with how the US is currently acting. Something's going to give eventually, and this will all fall apart. And make no mistake, the US WILL be at the center of it all. You know...unless Trump's time ends prematurely somehow, and someone who's actually competent takes things over from there.

EDIT: LOL wow, I was expecting to be proven right pretty quickly, but not THAT quickly! Trump really can't just let the global economy rest for one day, can he? The article made a good point. Expectations are better than they were after liberation day, but we’ve also celebrated the same China deal 3x. Pair this with earlier data hinting that retail was buying while institutions were selling, it makes me feel like we’re seeing bullish retail investors looking to buy the dip rather than a data driven market value.

That could mean nothing, but retail could be getting greedy and over-investing their savings in a weaker market. Make your money while you can Boys, the economy is the Titanic heading for Iceberg at full speed ahead. Investors right now are desperate for good news and, like you mentioned, will celebrate the same thing 3 times as 3 separate boons, not realizing that nothing has really changed.  But each time those share prices go up.  The bubble just keeps getting bigger and bigger.

Human psychology is just a hot mess.  Aliens are better leaving us alone. LOL, Canada is very bad, they are mean to me. More tariffs on them, bigly. Trade Deal with Mars has been priced in at this point…

Meanwhile 6 cuts were “priced in for 2025” at New Year, but we’re now down to 2 — and yet here we are at all time highs. 

This is literally just a case of a market-wide gamma squeeze that started beginning of June as market makers were buying shares to hedge the INSANE amount of puts that they were selling in March and April. And then an inability to go neutral in time for June OPEX — and then boom, we’re left with the gap-up run this week following June 20th. 

But market makers are holding a ton of shares and WILL sell to go neutral as soon as everyone and their mom is buying calls.

1lmofke,2025-06-28,"Some nice trades from my previously posted bottomed stocks. the next one I found is $ATER
$SGN was our biggest winner recently as we saw around 500% returns from our early entry. $SGMA we got 100% move on a buyout. $SSY gave us multiple 50% moves for anyone that traded it while we wait for the upcoming merger. $GLMD has moved 50% so far going into this upcoming catalyst. My next bottomed stock I like is $ATER. The chart is crazy oversold in the long term but here’s why I think we can see this reversal off bottom. This year we saw the company write a letter to shareholders for the first time stating they have made some changes to stabilize the company and position itself to regain shareholder value. “More importantly, we believe that our efforts to date have placed us firmly on the path to producing these results on a substantial basis.” Key word here is SUBSTANTIAL. They seem to be taking the necessary steps needed to become profitable. With a market cap around only $16m and revenues over $90m for the last 12 months, there’s a lot of room for $ATER to grow. Recently they have announced product launches on Temu and in Walmart $WMT stores nation wide. Also they have announced expansions into Columbia, Chile and Argentina. These few moves alone should boost that revenue numbers. Not only with revenues potentially going up, they also have implemented strategic operational cost saving measures that are estimated to deliver $5-6m of savings in 2025. The company recently announced a $3m share buy back program which gives us the idea that they feel these stock prices are undervalued here especially with the upcoming new product releases this year. With analyst price targets between $4-8 and a base intrinsic value of over $23, there’s a lot of potential upside seen on $ATER. 
Technical Outlook: The stock is trading near its 52-week low, suggesting bearish momentum. The recent price decline indicates a lack of upward support, and the stock has been underperforming compared to broader market indices.

Risk Factors: Key risks include declining revenues, increasing losses, and a low stock price, which may deter potential investors. The company's financial instability and market challenges pose significant concerns.

Key Metrics: Market Cap: $9.29 million Revenue (TTM): $94.19 million Net Income (TTM): -$10.60 million EPS (TTM): -$1.46 52-Week Range: $1.22 - $3.84
Market Sentiment: The overall market sentiment is negative, with Aterian's stock trading at a 52-week low and facing financial difficulties. The company's recent performance and market challenges contribute to a bearish outlook.

1lmjx55,2025-06-28,"(SRFM) This $3.x Stock Could Be $10–18 in 2027 (Even If They Dilute Heavily) — Real Revenue + Palantir Deal
I’ve been researching **Surf Air Mobility (SRFM)**, which is currently trading around **$3 and change**, and I think it’s one of the more underrated plays in the small-cap space. This isn’t just another penny aviation stock — they have a real business, real revenue, and a legit roadmap that includes **electrifying aircraft** and building a regional air travel software platform (**SurfOS**) in partnership with **Palantir**.



Yes — that’s **Palantir**, co-founded by **Peter Thiel**. They’re not just name-dropping; Surf Air signed an exclusive deal with Palantir to power SurfOS, which will be commercialized starting in 2026.



Now let’s talk numbers.

The **revenue forecasts** I used come directly from **Yahoo Finance and StockAnalysis**. Here’s the breakdown:



* **2025:** $104M (intentionally down from 2024 due to cutting unprofitable routes)
* **2026:** $161M
* **2027:** $255M





Losses are also shrinking fast: EPS is expected to improve from –$5.80 in 2024 to just –$1.14 by 2027. They’ve also guided for **adjusted EBITDA profitability by the end of 2025**.



The company currently has about **30M shares outstanding**, but I ran multiple scenarios to model the upside **even under worst-case dilution**:



* **Realistic dilution** if they raise efficiently = **40–50M shares**
* **Worst-case scenario** if they raise aggressively at lower prices and add stock-based comp = **70M shares**





Now let’s assume the 2027 revenue target of $255M holds true and calculate what the share price would be under 70M shares:



* 2× P/S = $510M market cap → **$7.30/share**
* 3× P/S = $765M → **$10.90/share**
* 4–5× P/S if SurfOS gains traction = **$14.60 to $18.30/share**





That’s **3x–5x upside** from today’s \~$3/share even in a worst-case dilution scenario.



In other words: this isn’t one of those moonshot “what if” stories. It’s a real company, backed by real partners, with a defined 4-phase plan (transformation, optimization, expansion, acceleration). The next 18–24 months are about proving profitability and software traction — and at this valuation, you’re paying **less than 1x 2027 revenue** even if they max out dilution.



I’m in, and I’ll be adding slowly if they keep executing. Not financial advice — just sharing my thesis and would love to hear feedback or counterpoints.
Everyone is talking numbers but nobody is looking at the problem that they're trying to solve. 

That determines if the stock is worth it's weight or not. 

All of the things that they're doing, bigger players are already doing than them. I don't think they're worth anything and I'm sorry

Surf Air Mobility (NYSE: SRFM) is addressing the challenge of sustainable, efficient, and accessible regional air travel. The company’s mission is to revolutionize regional air mobility by:

Developing and commercializing electric-powered aircraft to reduce the environmental impact of air travel.

Creating an AI-driven software platform (SurfOS) to optimize flight scheduling, pricing, and operational analytics, making regional air travel more efficient and reliable.

Connecting underserved urban and rural communities through cost-effective, localized air transportation, thereby improving regional connectivity and reducing reliance on traditional, less eco-friendly airlines

^(if) ^(you) ^(have) ^(any) ^(questions) ^(or) ^(concerns.) Ive been eyeing them. I bought a while back ~$2 and sold last time it was above $4. Been looking for a reason to buy back im. PLTR put more money into them, not sure why, but i know its related to their recent upward movement from below $2. 

Something might be brewing. Hard to say. Not that it changes or changed my position ;) Technical Outlook: The stock is trading below its 50-day moving average, indicating bearish momentum. Key technical indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), suggest a neutral to bearish trend. The stock's 52-week range spans from $0.90 to $6.72, reflecting high volatility.

Risk Factors: The company has a negative equity position of $-135.6 million and a debt-to-equity ratio of -55.5%, indicating financial instability. An Altman-Z score of -10.28 places SRFM in the distress zone, suggesting a risk of bankruptcy. Liquidity ratios, including a current ratio of 0.22, indicate potential difficulties in meeting short-term obligations.
Key Metrics: Market capitalization: $63.058 million Shares outstanding: 19.28 million 52-week high: $6.72 52-week low: $0.90 Price-to-sales ratio: 0.4x Fair price-to-sales ratio: 0.3x

Market Sentiment: Analyst consensus is a 'Strong Buy' with an average 12-month price target of $6.42, suggesting potential upside. However, given the company's financial challenges and recent stock performance, market sentiment is cautious.

Take that as you will. I will be following this stock. They did dilute, during the first run. Just like a $PLTR invested company to pull that shit.

1lmbzrb,2025-06-28,"$SYNX - The DD you should not miss!
**Sylinxcom ($SYNX) – Key Facts**

Market Cap: around $11 million  
Revenue: $9.1 million (up 20% year-over-year)  
Gross Profit: $3.8 million (about 42% margin)

This isn’t your average cash-burning nanocap. Sylinxcom is already delivering solid margins, real revenue, and building deep roots in the global defense ecosystem — right now.

**What Makes SYNX Stand Out**

* Supplying battlefield communication systems to top-tier military clients including the US Air Force, Navy SEALs, IDF, and many more well known army'
* Specializes in rugged tactical headsets, now expanding into drone detection that can be included in their existing products or implemented in vehicles — great positioning for the next evolution of battlefield technology
* With NATO countries ramping defense budgets toward 5% GDP, Sylinxcom already has a foothold.   Just 1 relatively small 50 million contract could drive the stock up 500% from it's current level
* Revenue is growing fast and margins are strong — rare for a company of this size and stage
* The military sector is not their only sector for growth. They are already selling their products to law enforcements, industrial companies and commercial. Everytime sound protection + communication is of importance you find use cases
* Recent wars have shown that secure and reliable communication is absolutely critical to mission success, regardless of how chaotic or harsh the battlefield environment may be.

**Key Catalysts Ahead (based on latest SEC 20-F filing)**

* Pursuing a project to integrate SYNX Technology in existing systems of Leonardo, one of Europe’s largest defense companies
* Currently in the bidding process for several large European military contracts
* Working on renewing existing contracts with US Special Forces

**Tight Share Structure = Huge Upside Potential**

* Insider ownership is around 60% — the founders are fully committed and heavily invested
* One institutional investor has quietly increased their stake to 17.6 percent, with the lowest reported buy at $2.50 (and many buys with higher prices). Current price is around $1.70, near its 52-week low
* This means about 78% of shares are locked up, leaving only 22% in the public float. That’s incredibly tight for a stock this small, and it sets the stage for sharp moves on any positive news
* No shady or toxic financing structure that many nano caps often have to accept.

**Final Thoughts**

Sylinxcom is early, real, and lean. Trusted by elite militaries and already competing for major new contracts, they’re one deal away from a major re-rating. With founder skin in the game, strong margins, no shady financing, and exposure to both defense and civilian markets, SYNX has the ingredients to be one of the most explosive microcap stories of the year.
Flat revenues, unprofitable, negative cash flow, cash runway almost up. Offering/dilution incoming. What caused the big drop in March/April 2025? They raised $2M at a share price of $2.5. Investors don't like dilution, but it was actually just a small dilution and in my opinion an overreaction. This an Israeli company?

I can’t find their earnings for q1 2025. Can you provide link ? They barely filed 2024. https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1976443/000121390025037589/ea0240169-nt20f_silynxcom.htm

1lm8l37,2025-06-27,"$SAGT - Hidden Gem in SaaS, AI, and Robotics
Hey r/pennystocks, buckle up because I’m about to drop a DD on a massively undervalued play that’s flying under the radar: **Sagtec Global Limited($SAGT)**. This Southeast Asia-based tech powerhouse is serving up a perfect storm of SaaS, AI, and robotics, with a July call that could send this stock to the moon. 🔥

# The Big Picture

$SAGT is a tech company based in Southeast Asia, focusing on **end-to-end technology solutions** for small businesses. Think of it as a one-stop shop for everything a small restaurant needs to thrive in the digital age—POS systems, inventory management, AI-driven customer analytics, and even **robotics** for automation. Their recent acquisition unlocks a **combined TAM exceeding $130B**, driven by AI in retail ($43B by 2032, Markets and Markets), SME-focused AI software ($25B, IDC), and intelligent POS and analytics ($65B, Grand View Research). Small restaurants are everywhere, and they’re desperate for affordable, scalable tech to compete with the big dogs. 🍜💻

# Why $SAGT is a Screaming Buy

Here’s the juicy DD based on what I’ve dug up:

1. **Explosive Growth**: $SAGT is growing at **close to 100% YoY**. That’s right—near triple-digit revenue growth! This isn’t some speculative biotech; they’re already delivering solutions and raking in cash. With Southeast Asia’s digital economy exploding (expected to hit $1T by 2030), $SAGT is riding a megatrend.
2. **Dirt-Cheap Valuation**: Trading at **sub 3x sales**, this is an absolute steal for a tech company with this kind of growth. Compare that to SaaS peers like Toast ($TOST) trading at 7-10x sales or other AI plays at 15x+. $SAGT is a value investor’s dream with hyper-growth upside.
3. **No Debt, Profitable, No Dilution Risk**: $SAGT is **debt-free** and **profitable**, a rarity in the penny stock world. They have **no immediate capital needs**, meaning no dilution from share offerings to tank the stock price. This is a clean balance sheet ready to scale.
4. **Recent Accretive Acquisition**: They just announced a **definitive agreement to acquire 80% of Smart Bridge Technology**. This deal is expected to accelerate SaaS revenue and expand their multi-sector presence. It’s accretive, meaning it’ll boost earnings immediately, and the market hasn’t fully priced this in yet. 🚀
5. **Founder-Led with Skin in the Game**: The Founder/CEO owns a whopping **80% of shares**, aligning management’s interests with shareholders. This isn’t some pump-and-dump; the leadership is all-in on long-term success.
6. **No Wall Street Noise**: Zero research coverage and **no institutional ownership** mean this is a true undiscovered gem. Once analysts catch wind (especially after the July call), expect a flood of interest. Penny stock investors know this is where the big gains are made—before the suits pile in.
7. **The AI and Robotics Edge**: $SAGT isn’t just another SaaS company. They’re integrating **AI** for predictive analytics (e.g., customer behavior, inventory optimization) and **robotics** for automation in restaurants (think robotic prep stations or delivery bots). This is next-level tech for an industry stuck in the stone age. Their recent acquisition of Smart Bridge Technology bolsters their AI capabilities, positioning them as a leader in this niche.
8. **Southeast Asia Advantage**: Operating in Southeast Asia gives $SAGT a cost advantage and access to a rapidly growing market. Countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand are seeing a surge in small businesses adopting tech, and $SAGT is the go-to provider for affordable solutions.

# Market Cap and Revenue Pipeline

$SAGT’s market capitalization is currently **$26.48 million** (as of June 27, 2025), a steal for a company with such high growth potential. Their revenue for FY2024 hit **$11.6 million**, up **78% YoY** from $6.5 million in 2023, driven by strong adoption of their Speed+ smart ordering system and kiosk sales. Looking ahead, $SAGT has secured a robust revenue pipeline, including a **$30 million deal** over five years through an exclusive UAE partnership with SMD Tech for 10,000 Speed+ software licenses. Additionally, they’ve signed **$5 million in commercial contracts** in Southeast Asia and are targeting a **$50 million pipeline** over the next 12 months. With a projected **92% revenue growth to $22.3 million in FY2025**, $SAGT’s low market cap and strong pipeline make it a compelling undervalued play.

# The July Call: Why It’s a Game-Changer

Mark your calendars for **July 2025**, because $SAGT’s upcoming call is going to be a catalyst. They’re projecting **92% revenue growth for FY2025** (per the Smart Bridge acquisition announcement), and this call will likely dive into:

* Details on the Smart Bridge acquisition and how it’s already boosting margins.
* Updates on their AI and robotics pipeline—expect some jaw-dropping product reveals.
* Guidance on revenue and expansion plans, especially in untapped Southeast Asian markets.
* Potential partnerships or new contracts with restaurant chains or tech distributors.

With no research coverage and institutional investors still on the sidelines, this call could be the spark that puts $SAGT on the map. Imagine the FOMO when Wall Street wakes up to a profitable, debt-free, 100% growth company trading at 3x sales! 📈

# The Bottom Line

$SAGT is a rare breed: a profitable, debt-free, high-growth penny stock with a massive TAM, trading at a laughably low valuation. The Smart Bridge acquisition and the upcoming **July call** are catalysts that could send this stock soaring. If you’re looking for a ground-floor opportunity in the SaaS, AI, and robotics space, $SAGT is your ticket. Get in before the Wall Street crowd catches on! 
Why would you hide your cost basis? Because he probably bought in at 6 or even higher before this dropped like a ton of bricks. 

I am however interested and might throw a few hundred towards it on monday. 2 year old account with no posts or comments other than this AI summary… convince me you’re a real person and that you’re actually invested here

1lm4u49,2025-06-27,"FAQ for Getting Payment in Nikola Investor Settlement
Hey guys, if you missed Nikola finally agreed to settle with investors over the issues around its truck production. They’re still working on the details, but since they’re already accepting claims, I decided to share it with you with a little FAQ.



Long story short, in 2020, Nikola went public, claiming to have revolutionary technology and billions in pre-orders. However, a few months later, a report accused NKLA of exaggerating the functionality of its vehicles, including the Nikola One ""In Motion"" video, which showed an inoperable truck rolling downhill. The stock dropped 76%, and investors filed a lawsuit against Nikola for their losses.



The good news is that $NKLA finally settled with investors, and they’re accepting claims. 



So here is a little FAQ for this settlement:      



Q. Who can claim this settlement?



A. All persons who purchased or otherwise acquired Nikola common stock during the period from June 4, 2020, through February 25, 2021, inclusive, and were damaged thereby​.

  


Q. Do I need to sell/lose my shares to get this settlement?



A. No, if you have purchased the shares during the class period, you are eligible to participate.



Q. How much will my payment be?



A. The final payout amount depends on your specific trades and the number of investors participating in the settlement.



Q. How long does the payout process take?



A. It typically takes 4 to 9 months after the claim deadline for payouts to be processed, depending on the court and settlement administration.

You can check if you are eligible and file a claim here: [https://11th.com/cases/nikola-invetor-settlement](https://11th.com/cases/nikola-invetor-settlement)

1lm4b8r,2025-06-27,"INmune Bio - A Potential Alzheimer’s Game-Changer with a Major Catalyst on June 30
**TL;DR: #INmoon Bio**  
INmune Bio (INMB) is a small-cap biotech developing XPro1595, a first-in-class drug that targets neuroinflammation by crossing the blood-brain barrier—a rare and promising approach for treating Alzheimer’s. Phase II trial results drop June 30, with potential to show meaningful cognitive improvements. The company just raised $19M at $6.30/share to fund next steps, so dilution risk is mostly priced in. This is a high-risk, high-reward penny stock play with a market cap around $150 million. 

**Hi everyone,**   
I wanted to share a deep dive on a penny stock biotech that’s flying under the radar but has a **potentially massive catalyst coming up on June 30** — **INmune Bio (ticker: INMB)**. This isn’t your typical speculative pump; this company is tackling Alzheimer’s with a novel mechanism and a Phase II trial readout right around the corner.

# Why INmune Bio Is Worth Watching:

# 1. Unique Mechanism Targeting Neuroinflammation

* INMB’s lead drug, **XPro1595**, is a **first-in-class selective soluble TNF (sTNF) blocker**.
* Unlike other therapies that target amyloid plaques or tau protein, XPro targets **neuroinflammation**, which recent science suggests is a major driver in Alzheimer’s progression.
* Importantly, XPro is one of the very few biologics that **cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB)**, meaning it can act directly in the brain to reduce harmful inflammation. 98% of drugs don’t get this far.

# 2. Promising Phase II Trial (MINDFuL Study) With Data Coming June 30

* The Phase II MINDFuL trial involves **208 early Alzheimer’s patients with inflammatory biomarkers**.
* Patients are being monitored via **cognitive function tests**:
   * **EMACC (primary endpoint)** — measuring meaningful cognitive improvement
   * **CDR-SB (secondary endpoint)** — assessing functional ability
* Results expected June 30 will reveal if XPro meaningfully slows or reverses cognitive decline.

# 3. Dilution and Cash Runway

* INMB recently announced a **registered direct offering** to raise about **$19 million at $6.30/share**, expected to close just before or around the data release.
* While this caused some short-term volatility and dilution fears, it significantly strengthens the company’s cash position, giving them runway to plan a Phase III trial or negotiate partnerships.
* Importantly, this means near-term funding worries are largely priced in.

# 4. Market Cap and Volatility

* INMB is currently trading around a **$150 million market cap**, making it a true penny stock with high volatility but asymmetric upside potential if the data is positive.
* The stock’s recent wild swings reflect anticipation and speculation, but also opportunity for entry at a discounted level post-dilution.

# 5. Potential for Paradigm-Shifting Impact and Buyout

* Alzheimer’s drug development has been plagued by failures, but XPro’s novel approach and ability to affect the brain’s immune response sets it apart.
* If Phase II data is positive, INMB could become a **takeover target for big pharma**, or rapidly advance into pivotal trials with solid backing.

# Risks to Keep in Mind:

* As with any biotech, especially penny stocks, this is a **high-risk, high-reward play**.
* The upcoming data release is binary — strong data could multiply the stock price, weak data could cause a steep drop.
* Small market cap means liquidity can be thin and price swings dramatic.
* Always position size responsibly.

# Summary:

INmune Bio is a **low market cap, under-the-radar biotech** with a **unique, science-backed approach to Alzheimer’s** and a **major catalyst** just days away. The recent capital raise strengthens their position ahead of the data, and the stock’s volatility offers an entry point with asymmetric upside if the trial delivers.

If you’re looking for a speculative biotech penny stock with real scientific merit and a near-term event, **INMB deserves a look**.

**Disclosure:** I hold shares and plan to hold through June 30.
I got fucked hard with no lube.  FUCK this company..  yes it was my own stupid fault..  🤬

They should have some kind of test like they do for Captcha or pick out dogs in a puzzle or something before I can click 'buy'...  Hopefully my stupidity would save me occasionally Looks like the direct offering went to healthcare VCs. This is somewhat different than dilution at market rates. It implies they have partners willing to put about $20 million into the company two days before results are announced. There's no way they would do this if the results aren't very positive.

Tldr, the people with the money have the info, and they are buying Widow maker. Biotech & Alzheimer is like 95%+ fail rate. Most have failed over the years. Figuring out neurological treatment in the brain is like looking for needle in a haystack 

Phases takes years and drains funds with a lower chance of success phase 3 onwards

* They’ve laid out a clear roadmap to profitability by 2025.

# Risks

* The legal outcome is uncertain.
* The business is still turning around.
* The stock is volatile and high-risk.

Bottom Line:  
GNS is a high-upside, multi-catalyst play: real AI business, major lawsuit potential, and a bold Bitcoin strategy. Big risk—but potentially huge reward.
Good find

1lm2hpj,2025-06-27,"$AMPX DD, strap in regards
Hi Degens: long time lurker, first time poster with some DD. Read, roast me, or scroll past, but here’s why I’m bullish AF

Ticker: $AMPX
Current Price: around $4
Market Cap: around $400m
TLDR: Amprius makes silicon anode batteries that destroy traditional lithium-ion cells in every performance metric. They’re already shipping to defense and aerospace clients (think drones, UAVs, etc.) And if they break into EVs? 

Why AMPX Isn’t Just Battery Hopium

Let’s get this out of the way first:
Amprius makes silicon anode lithium batteries.
Not fancy-sounding “solid state” science projects that need 7 more years in a lab—these batteries actually work, are in production, and are already in the field.

Here’s how they stack up vs. traditional lithium-ion (graphite anode) cells: 

Energy Density: 2x traditional lithium
Charge Time: as low as 6 minutes 
Weight: 50% lighter 
Cycle Life: This is the theoretical problem with silicon anodes which has stopped them from being mass-produced. Amprius has figured out a way to get 500 cycles and it’s been improving.

If you want longer range, lighter aircraft, faster charge, and a power source that doesn’t need its own backpack, you want this.

These are not hypothetical specs. Drone manufacturers are already using them. Reddit reviews say that these batteries are blowing peoples minds.

WHY NOW: UAVs, Defense Spending, and a War-Obsessed World

Let’s talk macro: The world is falling apart and every major power is funneling cash into defense tech like it’s 1942.

UAVs and drones are so hot right now. They are the future of war. Read the many DDs of drone companies all over Reddit.

Drones need light, dense, ultra-fast-charging batteries.
	
US Defense Dept. has already awarded Amprius contracts.

“We need 500 Wh/kg batteries for tactical edge UAVs.”
-The Pentagon, probably

AMPX is already delivering to Department of Defense contractors. They’re ramping production, and desperately trying to get enough manufacturing capacity to fulfill demand.

Add:
Rising global tension (Middle east, China, Ukraine)
Shift toward electrification of everything in combat
Near-term demand for lightweight, high-performance batteries

And you’ve got the perfect storm for Amprius to dominate military battery tech.

And what if…EVs? 

Silicon anode batteries are the holy grail of EVs.
Double the range
Half the weight
Full charge while you refill your coffee.

EV makers are all chasing new battery technology. Tesla has talked about it for years, and other OEMs are investing billions in R&D.

But guess what?

Amprius already cracked it. They just need scale.

Their roadmap includes expansion into automotive-scale production by 2026–2027. They’re currently sampling cells to automakers, and pilot programs are underway.

This is the classic “picks and shovels” play. catch them before they hit the big leagues.

And they have actual sales: This Ain’t a Science Fair Project

Revenue is already ramping:
Q1 2024: Revenue up 225% YoY
Multiple new clients added in aerospace, drones, and defense

2025 and 2026 will be inflection years as new facilities go online.

Also: Insiders are NOT selling.
In fact, there’ve been multiple buys and strategic investments in recent months.

This is not a penny stock with vaporware. This is a real company, shipping a real, game-changing product, with:
Massive tailwinds from global defense spending
A potential EV expansion catalyst
Crazy asymmetric upside from a sub-$500M market cap
And oh yeah… they have no meaningful competition. There are a couple other companies trying to crack silicon but Amprius already has.

THE RISKS (Because I’m probably a Degenerate)
Production scale risk: Can they actually build enough?
Competition: Big dogs like Tesla/Panasonic could play catch-up
Battery industry is cutthroat and capex-heavy
Still not profitable (this is Reddit, do we care?)

But remember, we’re early. Like pre-Model S Tesla early.

Buy a few shares. Forget about them. Come back when your fridge has a drone delivering your groceries, and it’s powered by Amprius.



Positions: Long (obviously)
Not financial advice. I’m just a degenerate with a dream and a battery pack

Roast me in the comments


silicon nanowire anode and cathode. The lithium fits into the pores, and there is enough room to expand. Thanks for the post, you are preaching to the converted. I looked at Quantumscape, Enovix, and Amprius, and decided to invest in Amprius. I think the silicon nanowire design has the edge on the other two.

^(if) ^(you) ^(have) ^(any) ^(questions) ^(or) ^(concerns.) Have you looked at the financials of AMPX ?
How far are they building their fabric in Colorado? So did I. I found it fishy that QS and ENVX are much less forthcoming with battery specs than Amprius. They are also much more expensive from à P/S point of view QS recently claimed to have made a major manufacturing break though recently. But they are still very far from mass manufacturing. Their stock price jumped but will go down eventually. The specs:

1lm0wbi,2025-06-27,"PSTV - is $3.80 programmed?

Doing some research and stumbled on some Alpha— Plus Therapeutics ($PSTV) may be quietly setting up one of the most mathematically predictable climbs we’ve seen in a while. And no, this isn’t some hyped-up meme pump — it’s baked into their financing structure.

Here’s what’s going on:

⸻

THE SETUP
	•	PSTV is raising $25 million via equity financing
	•	They’re limited to selling 300,000 shares per day
	•	To hit the full $25M in 60 days, the share price must gradually rise
	•	Starts at $0.30 and must climb to about $3.80 by Day 60

If the price stays flat at $0.30, they’d only raise around $5.4M. That’s not enough.
If the price increases about 4.4% per day, they hit the full $25M right on time. This isn’t speculation — it’s just math.

This is one of the rare times where price growth is structurally necessary for the plan to succeed.

⸻

DARK POOL ACTIVITY JUST DROPPED — BIG SIGNAL

Huge development:
	•	Short volume in dark pools dropped from 164 million shares to 29 million
	•	That’s a massive unwind, and it’s likely a signal that institutional shorts are backing off or covering

Institutions may have shorted PSTV heavily during its weaker phases, selling shares they didn’t own to suppress the price.
But now? The price has to rise for the funding deal to succeed — and suddenly, short volume collapses.  Also, HC Wainwright magically adjusted their outlook to $3. That timing isn’t coincidence.

⸻

WHERE THE BREAKOUT COULD START

Here’s the likely pressure point setup:
	1.	Price hits $0.50 to $1.00 → shorts start to panic
	2.	Short volume stays low → selling pressure eases
	3.	Price needs to reach $3.80 by Day 60 → the funding partner may begin actively supporting the price

The closer it gets to that $3.80 mark, the more explosive it could get.

⸻

""A"" PLAN

Right now, this stock is at .32. If this hits just $1, you’re already up huge.

But I’ve mapped out a strategy to secure profits while still keeping upside alive:
	•	Sell 500 shares at $1.50
	•	Sell 500 at $2.50
	•	Sell 400 at $3.80
	•	Keep 700 for moon dreams in case this rips to $5 or higher

Goal: lock in ~ $2,500 profit and let the rest run.

⸻

THIS ISN’T RANDOM

Notice the back-to-back “positive” press releases? That’s not coincidence. It’s part of a controlled campaign to support the price — not flood the market.

They’re not dumping shares into the market — they’re managing the slope upward to hit a funding goal.

⸻

WHAT IS PSTV?

Plus Therapeutics (NASDAQ: PSTV) is a clinical-stage biotech company developing targeted radiotherapeutics for rare and difficult-to-treat cancers, including glioblastoma, leptomeningeal metastases, and other CNS tumors. Their platform uses radioisotope-based drugs delivered directly into cancerous tissue through localized infusion, maximizing tumor impact while minimizing harm to healthy cells. They’ve received FDA Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations and are backed by NIH funding and military grant support, giving them both regulatory momentum and long-term potential.

FINAL THOUGHTS

	•	PSTV is in a rare position where price growth isn’t just hopeful — it’s required
	•	Short sellers appear to be backing off
	•	Positive news isn’t random — it’s part of a carefully timed strategy
	•	$3.80 isn’t a dream target — it’s a math-backed funding goal
	•	If it gains momentum, it could ignite something far bigger

If it runs, you heard it here first, save receipts now!
No such thing as a free lunch This news certainly helped the equity price--https://finance.yahoo.com/news/plus-therapeutics-announces-comprehensive-restructuring-113000722.html And the shorts were caught....short. But they still need to raise capital. There is NO way you can project a guarantee on stock movement. Sorry. Not possible. Be careful with this one. Just an opinion. ""Down 16% today? That's just PSTV's morning warm-up routine 

With 35% average daily swings, this thing moves more than my wife's boyfriend when he hears me coming home. Still needs to 40x to hit those analyst targets, so today's dip is just a rounding error on the way to tendie town (or zero, I eat crayons remember)."" Question.....

 Now let's get this straight. I'm dumb as hell in this stock trading world. I huff the brake cleaner and paint in the shop class, sniff the sharpies and then i eat the crayons.

But..... if it MUST go to 3.80..... why are you selling along the way? Wouldn't you let your .30ish shares ride? Because things breakdown, black swans fly, and shit happens - this is a use case where the company has coordinated a pump but you have to hedge against Murphy’s Law always. Appreciate the caution, and you’re absolutely right that no outcome is guaranteed — market behavior always involves uncertainty.

That said, the unique aspect of PSTV’s current financing structure is that it creates a mathematically modeled incentive alignment between the issuer (PSTV) and the capital provider (Lincoln Park Capital). The agreement caps daily equity sales at 300,000 shares, meaning that in order to raise the full $25 million authorized over a 60-day horizon, the average share price must increase incrementally — from roughly $0.30 to a terminal value near $3.80.

This isn’t a speculative projection about market behavior — it’s a structural reality embedded in the financing math. If the share price remains static, the company raises significantly less than intended. Therefore, both the company and the funding counterparty have vested interest in maintaining orderly upward price momentum — either through press releases, investor engagement, or withholding supply from the market.

Of course, market volatility and external factors could derail that trajectory — which is why this is not a prediction, but rather an analysis of aligned incentives and capital structure mechanics. Agreed! Smart move, that’s exactly how I’m playing a setup like this. Let the structure prove itself, then scale in as the trend confirms. With the 300K/day limit and funding math baked in, the company needs gradual upward momentum, so if traction comes, it won’t be accidental.

Appreciate you being early. Sometimes the edge is just recognizing the setup before the crowd.

1llzd79,2025-06-27,"TBI AND LGCL
Not sure if you caught my last post, but I was giving the DL on LGCL, to which that day the stock rose over 100%. 

Another stock in human capital that is actually #1 on my board is TBI. They know what they are doing. Being an IO Psychologist myself, they are buying into the scientist practitioner model. Evidence based methos is king. And IO Psychology is the forerunner. TBI is all in on that front. Their service in particular named PeopleScout employs IO Psychologists, and they've been recently rewarded and recognized for their work. This will definitely infect all their other services, ie employing IO across all services. 

They recently turned down a buy out from hirequest for shares at 7.50. Turned down even 13 a share way back when.

This is a comeback company. May be slow. But nonetheless, it's #1 on my draft board.

CLNV HAS ALSO received 15 million in cold hard cash.

With NOTHING ELSE in consideration

As of TODAY, CLNV is worth - at a minimum- .025 cents per share (assuming lowballing undervalue)

  
And a fair price of .038 per share. 

That is not accounting for anything else.

Clean Vision Corporation (OCTQB:CLNV) (""Clean Vision"" or the ""Company""), an emerging leader in innovative plastic conversion and clean fuel development, is proud to announce that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Clean-Seas West Virginia, (CSWV) has shipped its first pyrolysis reactor to its flagship plastic-to-clean-fuel facility in Belle, West Virginia. The TRE unit, provided by American Renewable Technology Inc. (ARTI), was shipped on June 18 from California, and is expected to be operational by June 30 in West Virginia.

This TRE Unit reactor will accelerate the launch and operational readiness of CSWV's 50 ton/day facility, which is expected to open the fourth quarter of 2025 and divert post-use plastic from landfills and incinerators -- converting it to high value feedstocks for the circular plastic economy and green hydrogen, while fostering economic revitalization in the Kanawha Valley. Clean-Seas has secured the exclusive worldwide rights to ARTI's advanced pyrolysis technology for plastic conversion. The delivery of the system represents a critical milestone in the company's commitment to building a robust Plastic Conversion Network (PCN) across the United States and globally.

""Today marks a turning point not just for Clean-Seas West Virginia, but for the Belle community and the broader region,"" said Dan Bates, CEO of Clean Vision Corporation. ""By deploying this first unit, we are laying the groundwork for a larger, more impactful operation that will bring clean energy jobs to a region historically dependent on coal. We are proud to be part of the solution-creating economic opportunity while addressing the plastic waste crisis.""

Since March 2025, Clean-Seas engineers have been preparing the site and building necessary infrastructure to receive the TRE Unit as well as the full-scale unit.. Once operational, the pyrolysis reactor will be used to optimize process controls and safety protocols and to ensure the workforce is fully trained for the arrival of the 50TPD system, which is expected to be delivered later this summer.

This initiative underscores Clean-Seas' broader mission of building a circular plastic economy while delivering environmental and economic benefits to underserved regions. The Belle facility is the first of several planned Clean-Seas installations designed to transform the way communities manage plastic waste and generate alternative clean fuels.
Investing in green energy under the current administration? Good luck ![gif](giphy|iOm1xOSfAtPzmPXJqH)

😭😭😭😭 I probably won't remember this conversation on Monday. OP been trying to peddle this for months, and has never once posted their positions. Bagholder spotted Considering they're taking plastic feedstock and converting it into oil to sell to other companies. Trumps policies do next to nothing against it.

Even if he removes green incentives and promotes pro oil, CLNV still wins.

I wonder if you're going to say the same thing come Monday when their guest is announced. Ok, Mr. Bigshot. You been pumping this stock for months  (with outdated news, at that) and it's been steadily declining. If you actually knew what you were doing, you'd post your position, but you know that you can't show it without showing your bags. I see right through you not much of anything really. Worst case scenario it touches .012, but that isn't likely. They bought out their dilution just last week and their notes and have nothing but positive news incoming for the next two months.  .02 cents is already hard valued in as the minimum moving forward regardless of negative sentiment. They've been pumping this stock since the price drop in November. Red flags abound. Thank you for confirming they have that, and that's been why they've been trading at -checks notes- 15 million of value.

""CLNV currently trades at around .017- .019 at roughly 15 million value.""

Respectfully, can you just do what you said you were gonna do by Monday and exit lol. This isn't even worth my time at this point. I do. You are acting very emotionally about my comments, which indicates a desperation to get rid of bags. Anyone trying this hard to convince someone to buy something is always a grifter.",0,0.48,35,0,Ghostrabbit1,pennystocks,['C'],clnv officially undervalued clnv currently trades around 017 019 roughly 15 million value new reactor received even generates 4 tons per day lowest threshold revenue 4 tonsday 43000001200000 annual revenue4 times 300000 1200000 text annual revenue43000001200000 annual revenue valuation 10 multiple 120000010120000001200000 times 10 1200000012000001012000000 creates 12000000 revenue however generator also create 8 tons per day revenue scaling 50 tonsday 15myear revenue per tonday1500000050300000 per tonyeartextrevenue per tonday frac1500000050 300000 text per tonyearrevenue per tonday5015000000300000 per tonyear 83000002400000 annual revenue8 times 300000 2400000 text annual revenue83000002400000 annual revenue valuation 10 multiple 24000001024000000 valuation2400000 times 10 24000000 text valuation24000001024000000 valuation clnv also received 15 million cold hard cash nothing else consideration today clnv worth minimum 025 cents per share assuming lowballing undervalue fair price 038 per share accounting anything else clean vision corporation octqbclnv clean vision company emerging leader innovative plastic conversion clean fuel development proud announce whollyowned subsidiary cleanseas west virginia cswv shipped first pyrolysis reactor flagship plastictocleanfuel facility belle west virginia tre unit provided american renewable technology inc arti shipped june 18 california expected operational june 30 west virginia tre unit reactor accelerate launch operational readiness cswvs 50 tonday facility expected open fourth quarter 2025 divert postuse plastic landfills incinerators converting high value feedstocks circular plastic economy green hydrogen fostering economic revitalization kanawha valley cleanseas secured exclusive worldwide rights artis advanced pyrolysis technology plastic conversion delivery system represents critical milestone companys commitment building robust plastic conversion network pcn across united states globally today marks turning point cleanseas west virginia belle community broader region said dan bates ceo clean vision corporation deploying first unit laying groundwork larger impactful operation bring clean energy jobs region historically dependent coal proud part solutioncreating economic opportunity addressing plastic waste crisis since march 2025 cleanseas engineers preparing site building necessary infrastructure receive tre unit well fullscale unit operational pyrolysis reactor used optimize process controls safety protocols ensure workforce fully trained arrival 50tpd system expected delivered later summer initiative underscores cleanseas broader mission building circular plastic economy delivering environmental economic benefits underserved regions belle facility first several planned cleanseas installations designed transform way communities manage plastic waste generate alternative clean fuels investing green energy current administration good luck gifgiphyiom1xosfatpzmpxjqh probably wont remember conversation monday op trying peddle months never posted positions bagholder spotted considering theyre taking plastic feedstock converting oil sell companies trumps policies next nothing even removes green incentives promotes pro oil clnv still wins wonder youre going say thing come monday guest announced ok mr bigshot pumping stock months outdated news steadily declining actually knew youd post position know cant show without showing bags see right much anything really worst case scenario touches 012 isnt likely bought dilution last week notes nothing positive news incoming next two months 02 cents already hard valued minimum moving forward regardless negative sentiment theyve pumping stock since price drop november red flags abound thank confirming thats theyve trading checks notes 15 million value clnv currently trades around 017 019 roughly 15 million value respectfully said gonna monday exit lol isnt even worth time point acting emotionally comments indicates desperation get rid bags anyone trying hard convince someone buy something always grifter
