What I mean by this, is buying companies with a strong herd of followers that love the company no matter what regardless of the fundamentals. 

Some of the companies could be fundamentally sound, but some may not be. For example, Berkshire Hathaway has great fundamentals, and a cult like following. Another example, GME, terrible fundamentals, but stock continues to do great because of the followers. 

You could almost say the SP500 is a cult the way everyone blindly throws money into it. 

The objective of the idea is to identify a stock with cult like followers, and invest in it regardless of the fundamentals. What are your thoughts on this?",26,0.72,76,0,DualShockArtist,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ku9m7c/invest_in_cults_theory/,stocks,False,False

I’ve taken a few shots at shorting TSLA recently—some decent reads, but I keep getting caught by timing issues or stop-losses. One example: a few days ago I set my sell order at $355, but the stock topped out at $354.99 and never triggered. Then it dropped hard, and I missed the trade completely.

I currently hold small positions in Alphabet-C, Apple, Nvidia, gold, and REITs—so I’m mostly flat now and just watching the market.

Looking to learn and improve.

1. What strategies or indicators do you use when shorting Tesla?

2. How do you avoid getting stop-hunted or missing entries by a few cents?

3. Any good risk-management habits I should adopt?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( \^DJI ) fell 0.3 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500 ( \^GSPC ) also fell about 0.3 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( \^IXIC ) was down about 0.6 percent.

Apple Inc (AAPL) must pay a 25 percent tariff on iPhones sold in the U.S. but not made in the U.S., Trump said on Friday, and all three major stock indexes trimmed their losses sharply. The tech giant has begun shifting some of its manufacturing operations to India, while China, home to its main suppliers, is mired in a trade war with the United States. Apple shares fell 3 percent after Trump's tweet on Truth Social.

On Friday afternoon, Trump hinted that the tariffs would apply to other cellphone makers.

Trump told reporters Friday afternoon: ""The tariffs are going to be higher, and Samsung and any company that makes that product is going to be affected, or it's not fair. Again, they don't have tariffs on building factories here. That's why they'll build a factory here.""

Meanwhile, Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on EU imports “right up to 50 percent” as of June 1, as trade talks between China and Europe have stalled.",100,0.96,32,0,Aluseda,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ktsorm/dow_jones_sp_500_and_nasdaq_trim_losses_as_trump/,stocks,False,False
1ktqju3,2025-05-23 18:15:46+00:00,Oracle to buy $40bn of Nvidia chips for OpenAI’s new US data centre,"No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-buy-40-billion-nvidia-181443286.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-buy-40-billion-nvidia-181443286.html)

Paywall: [https://www.ft.com/content/a9cd130f-f6bf-4750-98cc-19d87394e657](https://www.ft.com/content/a9cd130f-f6bf-4750-98cc-19d87394e657)

Oracle will spend around $40bn on Nvidia’s high-performance computer chips to power OpenAI’s new giant US data centre, as tech groups race to build the vast infrastructure needed to underpin artificial intelligence models.

The site in Abilene, Texas, has been billed as the first US Stargate project, the $500bn data centre scheme spearheaded by OpenAI and SoftBank, and will provide 1.2 gigawatts of power when it is completed next year, making it one of the largest in the world.

Oracle will purchase around 400,000 of Nvidia’s GB200 chips — its latest “superchip” for training and running AI systems — and lease the computing power to OpenAI, according to several people familiar with the matter.

The site’s owners, Crusoe and US investment firm Blue Owl Capital, have raised $15bn in debt and equity to finance the Abilene project, which will encompass eight buildings and first broke ground in June last year.

The data centre is expected to be fully operational by mid-2026. Oracle has agreed to lease the site for 15 years. Stargate, which incorporated earlier this year, has not invested in the site.

JPMorgan has provided the bulk of the debt financing across two loans totalling $9.6bn, according to people close to the matter, including a $7.1bn loan announced this week. Crusoe and Blue Owl have separately invested around $5bn in cash.

Once completed, its scale will rival plans by Elon Musk to expand his “Colossus” data centre in Memphis, Tennessee, to house around 1mn Nvidia chips. Much of the data centre has so far been built on Nvidia’s earlier H100 and H200 chips, which are less powerful. Musk said this week that the next phase of Colossus would be the “first Gigawatt AI training supercluster”. Amazon is building a data centre in northern Virginia that will be larger than 1GW.

The Abilene data centre is a crucial step in OpenAI’s move to reduce its dependence on Microsoft. Previously, the $300bn-start up has exclusively relied on the US software giant for its computing power, and a large chunk of Microsoft’s near-$14bn investment in OpenAI has come in the form of cloud computing credits.

OpenAI and Microsoft agreed to terminate their exclusivity agreement earlier this year after the start-up became frustrated that its demand for power far exceeded the US tech giant’s supply. The two groups are negotiating to determine how long Microsoft will retain licensing rights to OpenAI’s models.

Stargate will play a key role in providing OpenAI’s future computing power. The high-profile venture, billed as a huge infrastructure project to boost the US AI industry, is raising $100bn to spend on data centre projects, with the figure rising to as much as $500bn over the next four years.

OpenAI and SoftBank have each committed $18bn to Stargate, which was unveiled in January by US President Donald Trump. Oracle and MGX, an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, committed a further $7bn each, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The four groups will hold equity stakes in the project, with SoftBank and OpenAI the majority owners, according to a second person with knowledge of the matter. Stargate has not committed capital to any data centre project so far.

OpenAI has also expanded its Stargate project overseas, with plans to build a massive data centre in the UAE that was announced as part of Trump’s Gulf tour last week. The 10 sq mile UAE-US AI campus, located in Abu Dhabi and built by Emirati AI company G42, is planned to have 5GW of data centre power — equivalent to more than 2mn of AI chipmaker Nvidia’s latest generation of GB200 chips.

* Bessent still has some cards he can play in regards to treasury purchases and rate cuts as long as the inflation numbers stay low

Cons:

* Inflation risks need to be monitored closely, seems Trump is in-tune to this and will back down Tariffs, Bessent also hinted at deals in the next couple weeks. But Trump being a wildcard makes this a risky play

1kua0i2,2025-05-24 12:03:45+00:00,"Trump Risks US Consumer Discontent With His Tariffs, Poll Shows","Summary by Bloomberg AI
A majority of US adults (56%) believe their household finances would be better off if Trump's tariffs had not been implemented.

69% of respondents expect higher costs for everyday goods as a result of the tariffs, and 49% believe the tariffs will be bad for the economy.

Three in five respondents reported cutting back on spending due to concerns around a potential recession, with 16% saying they haven't yet but expect to soon.

By Claire Ballentine and Shawn Donnan
05/24/2025 14:00:18 [BN]
(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump is struggling to persuade US consumers of the merits of his trade war, a Harris Poll for Bloomberg News found.

A majority of US adults, 56%, said their household finances would be better off if Trump’s tariffs had not been implemented. Some 52% of respondents said the promised benefits of the levies would not be worth their economic cost.

That assessment comes after Trump’s “Liberation Day” slate of tariffs made for the biggest act of US protectionism since the 1930s, helping push US taxation on imports to its highest level in nearly a century. The rollout was greeted with turmoil in financial markets and new concerns over the possibility of the US slipping into a recession.

The poll has a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points and was conducted May 8-10 among about 2,100 US adults. That means it fell after Trump paused many of the tariffs he unveiled in early April, but before the US and China agreed to temporarily lower their duties on one another while they continue negotiations. Even after all the whiplash, businesses like Walmart Inc. say higher prices are coming and economists say the US is still likely to see a slowdown in growth.

Americans appear to have absorbed those price warnings, with 69% of respondents saying they expect higher costs for everyday goods as a result of the tariffs. Trump himself has conceded that possibility, such as when he suggested children might have “two dolls instead of 30,” and that “maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally.”

Still, the president continues to aggressively tout his trade agenda as a strategy for bringing manufacturing jobs back the US.

Some 49% of consumers said they expect the tariffs to be bad for the economy, a larger share than the 30% that said the levies will be an economic boon.

While inflation is far lower than its recent peak and advanced at a slower pace than expected in April, three in five poll respondents said the cost of everyday items has risen compared to last month. That suggests a widespread perception that price increases remain a frequent fact of life.

Mackenzie Knight, a 35-year-old who works in human resources at a university in the Bay Area, is dreading how tariffs could further squeeze her budget. After a period of unemployment three years ago, she feels like she is just now on solid footing financially. It’s been difficult for her to build savings with rent prices so high in her area. 

“I’m not completely against tariffs if it’s an economic requirement that benefits both parties,” she said. “I just don't see how the current tariffs are helping anyone. For a lot of Americans, it’s very frustrating.”

Knight is also worried about the potential for a recession or at least an economic slowdown, which could result in losing her job. Although the stock market has recovered from the initial tariff shock and job growth remains solid, consumer sentiment fell to near a record low in a May report and JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Jamie Dimon recently warned against complacency in the face of economic risks.

According to the poll, half of Americans believe the economy has gotten weaker since 2024. Their appraisals appear heavily shaped by politics: Some 66% of Democrats say the economy has worsened from last year, when former President Joe Biden was still in office, compared to 25% of Republicans. More than half of independents said the economy had deteriorated.

Cutting Back 

As Trump’s tariff negotiations play out, some consumers are choosing to reduce their spending preemptively, girding for further price hikes that could hit their budgets. 

Major retailers have indicated they are, indeed, adapting their pricing. Walmart said this month that shoppers will start to see higher prices as it begins to pass on the costs of newer merchandise.

Price increases “are happening right now, and they'll become more obvious,” Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said in an interview with Bloomberg News on May 15.

Target Corp. also said it's adjusting prices in response to the volatile environment. The retailer, which is more reliant than Walmart on sales of discretionary products like apparel and home goods, cut its sales forecast this week after it saw a sharp pullback in consumer spending.

Three in five respondents reported cutting back due to concerns around a potential recession, with 16% saying they haven’t yet but expect to soon. Among those curtailing spending, more than 70% say they are eating out less and 57% report spending less on entertainment. 

And although about half of Americans say they have plans to travel this summer, a third of those people say they have fewer trips booked for this year compared to last summer.

Brad Russell, a 40-year-old in Philadelphia, said that he and his family are choosing cheaper vacations this summer, since they expect tariffs to increase their household costs in the coming months. Their budget is already stretched because he and his wife have two young kids and have to pay daycare expenses for both of them. 

Instead of doing weeklong trips, or splurges like a vacation to Disney World, the family is opting for weekend excursions to places like Williamsburg, Virginia. Rather than shell out for four plane tickets, they’re going to drive. 

“Even without the tariff madness, money is tight,” Russell said. “We're trying to be good stewards of our money and hopefully keep our heads above water over the next four years.”",70,0.93,19,0,cxr_cxr2,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1kua0i2/trump_risks_us_consumer_discontent_with_his/,stockmarket,False,False
