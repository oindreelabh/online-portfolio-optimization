1mmyick,2025-08-11,"Nextdoor - NXDR: The Next Local Platform Breakout & Why Reddit Buying it Makes Sense
Nextdoor is a hyperlocal social platform sitting at the intersection of community trust, local commerce, and utility. After years of underperformance, it’s in the middle of a *major product relaunch* that’s already driving better engagement and beating revenue estimates. With a market cap under $1B (\~3× revenue), there are multiple untapped monetization levers, and real strategic appeal to larger players (think Reddit, Facebook Marketplace, even Groupon style business lines). The turnaround is just beginning.

# Quick snapshot

* **Market cap:** \~$0.7–0.8B (smallcap, sub $1B).
* **Recent Q2 2025 revenue:** Nextdoor beat consensus (Q2 revenue ≈$65M) and reported improving engagement metrics. Management relaunched the app in July 2025 (big redesign & product pivot).
* **“The new Nextdoor”** (launched July 2025) focuses on Alerts, News, and Faves (AI recommendations + local publisher content), built to make Nextdoor *useful daily* rather than just a social feed.
* **Revenue (approx):** \~$240–250M (implied by recent results / public data). That puts current market cap at roughly \~3x revenue (very rough math).

# Bull case

1. **Founder/leadership momentum.** Nextdoor just rolled out “the new Nextdoor”, a material redesign that emphasizes *Alerts, News, and Faves* (AI recommendations, safety alerts, local news integration). The company is explicitly trying to move from underused UGC feed to a utility-first hyperlocal product. Q2 2025 showed revenue above Street estimates and management reported user engagement gains. That’s the classic early signal: product changes leading to higher engagement leading to more ad inventory and better local targeting. If the relaunch sustains engagement lifts, top line acceleration could follow.
2. **Hyperlocal moat trust & utility.** Facebook/Reddit are broad; Nextdoor owns neighborhood context (addresses/neighborhood boundaries, local public agencies, homeowners groups) and is integrating local news and authoritative alerts (police, utilities, weather). That makes it sticky for time sensitive local information, something Facebook Marketplace can’t fully replicate in a trust/utility sense.
3. **Multiple, under monetized local monetization levers.**
   * **Local ads** (SMBs, local chains, political/municipal buys).
   * **For sale / classifieds & marketplace** (native commerce, transaction take rates or promoted listings).
   * **Public sector / emergency alert contracts** (municipal subscriptions or paid integrations). The relaunch and better engagement can multiply ARPU without needing a full blown global ad sales machine. Q2 showed revenue growth and the company is still far from saturating local ad dollars.
4. **Low current valuation implies big upside for execution.** At \~$0.7–0.8B market cap on \~$240–250M revenue, Nextdoor trades at low revenue multiples (\~3x). If the product relaunch meaningfully improves revenue growth rate and margin profile, multiples could rerate toward higher comps (local ad / classifieds peers), giving sizable upside.
5. **Strategic optionality / M&A interest is plausible.** A hyperlocal network with community trust and data is interesting to players looking to fill local gaps: Reddit (community + local expansion), local classifieds / commerce players, or even retail/media acquirers. Being small cap makes it an easier acquisition target if the relaunch proves momentum. (I’ll expand on Reddit below.)
6. **Playbook borrowable from Groupon/local deals.** Nextdoor already has ""for sale & free"" and local business relationships. Adding structured local offers, time-limited promos, or merchant subscriptions (Groupon style vouchers, merchant promos, or subscription local deals) is a relatively straightforward product and revenue lift. Groupon’s continued local billings show the market still exists; Nextdoor could capture a portion by adding deals and integrating them into neighborhood flows and “Faves” recommendations.

**Catalysts to watch (bull triggers):**

* Sustained weekly/monthly active user growth and time on app after the relaunch.
* ARPU increase in upcoming quarters (ads + local commerce monetization).
* New paid partnerships with municipalities or publishers that create recurring revenue.

# Why Reddit buying Nextdoor could make sense

* **Why it’s logical:** Reddit wants to deepen “real world” community ties and monetize local advertiser demand; Nextdoor brings verified local neighborhoods, public safety integrations, and local ad inventory. Combining Reddit’s community driven content and ad products with Nextdoor’s local reach creates synergies: better local commerce, events, and localized Reddit communities with verified local utility.
* **Why it might not happen:** Reddit could easily build this themselves and one could argue that the subreddits already achieve the main functionality of Nextdoor without needing a seperate app or community.

# Facebook Marketplace Comparison

* Facebook Marketplace is massive and already accounts for huge listing volume and buyer traffic globally (hundreds of millions of users). Meta can bundle marketplace commerce and ad targeting more cheaply than a small competitor. **But** Marketplace is a horizontal player. Nextdoor’s advantage is *hyperlocal trust, neighborhood boundaries, and municipal/publisher relationships*. If Nextdoor nails utility (alerts, local news, verified neighbor recommendations, Faves), it retains defensibility even in the face of Facebook. Think: users who rely on the app for safety and local official alerts may prefer Nextdoor even if they sell on Marketplace.

# How Nextdoor can easily incorporate Groupon like features

* **Merchant dashboard + deals API:** let local merchants create time limited promos, featured deals in neighborhood feeds, or “welcome offers” for neighbors.
* **Promoted merchant cards:** place deals inside the “Faves” recommendation flow and local alerts.
* **Local vouchers + merchant payout integration:** low friction deals (digital coupons) with a small platform fee or merchant subscription. This is lowlift product work (existing forsale and business listings are already present); the value is in embedding offers where neighbors are already looking for recommendations (Faves) and in alerts. Groupon’s Q2 shows local deal demand still exists; Nextdoor could capture a healthier margin by focusing on repeat neighborhood customers rather than mass discounting.

# Valuation

* Market cap ≈ **$0.7–0.8B** vs LTM revenue ≈ **$240–250M** → **\~3x revenue**. For a small-cap social with improving engagement and multiple monetization levers, that multiple is low compared to growth comps that trade at higher revenue multiples when showing reliable growth and margin expansion. If Nextdoor can shift growth profile to midteens revenue growth and improve margins via ad monetization & local commerce, multiple expansion plus faster top-line could easily produce doubled (or more) share value.

# Bear case

1. **History of low engagement & moderation headaches.** Nextdoor has historically struggled with low daily active usage vs registered users and with content quality / moderation issues (which depress advertiser demand). If relaunch fails to fix these, advertisers may be slow to return.
2. **Burn & structural losses / tight balance sheet.** The company is still losing money (GAAP net losses and sizable stock comp / restructuring historically). If growth proves expensive or ad demand weakens, cash burn could force equity raises that dilute shareholders or constrain investment. Q2 numbers still showed negative adjusted EBITDA (though improved).
3. **Big competitors with scale and marketplace traction.** Meta’s Facebook Marketplace has enormous user reach and listing depth; Meta can bundle marketplace commerce with ad targeting at scale. If Facebook decides to deepen local utility + community features, Nextdoor could be outgunned on commerce. Meta’s massive audience and Marketplace stats show a very large TAM that’s hard for a small player to defend against.
4. **Execution risk on product overhaul.** Relaunches often raise expectations. If adoption is slow, or if new features don’t convert to monetizable usage (or create moderation/legal headaches), investors will punish the stock. The market is already skeptical (shares trade near multiyear lows).
5. **Ad market cyclicality & macro risk.** Local ad spend tends to be more cyclical. A broader ad slowdown or a recession could hit Nextdoor hard given its SMB exposure and lower ad pricing power.

# Bottom line / recommendation

* **Bullish case:** Low current valuation, a major product relaunch with clear utility (alerts/local news/AI recommendations), early signs of engagement/revenue improvement, and many undermonetized local revenue levers (ads, local commerce, municipal partnerships). If the relaunch sustains engagement, upside is meaningful.
* **Bearish case:** Execution risk, historical moderation/engagement problems, ongoing losses and potential dilution, and big competitors (Meta’s Marketplace) that can replicate commerce features.
Once you get on nextdoor you can't find the exit fast enough. Nextdoor = did anyone lose a dog/hear those gunshots? Nextdoor is full of Karens.  If you don’t act like a Karen, you get banned. Nextdoor is ASS nextdoor = where older MAGAs hang around WHO'S KIDS ARE THESE? It’s an interesting platform. Just doesn’t have a strong enough story to compel me to give it a second look. 

 I appreciate you giving bull and bear case here. Nice to see someone being fair  Please no Worst god damn social media app. Everybody is either asking if a noise was a gun shot or complaining about people putting dog poop in their trash can on the street. You also left out the most compelling thing which is that they have like 400 million in cash and the market cap is only like 650.

So the company is being valued at pretty much 1X revenue. You often see this in companies where they are burning cash, but they aren’t they’ve been free cash flow positive the last couple quarters.

This is great because downside is fairly limited as long as they can maintain that FCF.  Unfortunately it caps the upside quite a bit though as it will be much harder for this company to go 10X in a year.

1mmwihz,2025-08-10,"CENTENE (CNC) is a good long term opportunity at this level
Like every self-respecting Value investor, I've been looking for opportunities to divest from my tech-heavy portfolio. AI Stocks like NVDA, PLTR, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA have done great, but some of these valuations just don't make sense and I don't think now is a good time to buy into them anymore.

That brings me to look for other opportunities. I don't think there's a better opportunity right now than the Healthcare sector.

Historically, Healthcare has outperformed the S&P, thanks to relatively stable stocks like CNC.

Let's take a step back. What the f\*%# happened to this stock in the past 2 months ?

They came out and :

1. Said that their Medical Loss Ratio(MLR) will be much higher because claims are getting expensive
2. Pulled guidance for 2025

Since then, they've had their Q2 Earnings call. They've revised guidance to a EPS of 1.75 for 2025 (from 7.5 previously, ouch). Given that their Q1 2025 EPS was 2.9, and their Q2 EPS was -0.16, this is pricing in a combined -1$ EPS for Q3 and Q4.

The bar is very low. Even a small sign of life from the CEO, could send this stock easily back to the 40 - 50 range, as a path to profitability is starting to be priced into the stock.

The recent headwind, albeit very impactful in the short to medium-term, is temporary. the CEO has said that they have already completed rate re-filings in the 29 states by now, and that the rate decision for each states will be expected in September. The new rates that determine the amount of premiums received, will take into account the high cost for behavioral health(therapists, psychiatric meds etc...),  home health services, and expensive drugs (Wegovy, Ozempic...) .

Compared to the giant UNH, CNC has a much better reputation, isn't under DOJ Investigation, and Ambetter, their Health Insurance Marketplace, has a claims denial rate of 14%, more than half that of UNH.

# Path back to profitability :

CEO and the team are now laser focused on restoring profitability by pulling the necessary levers :

\- identifying and reducing areas where claims have been too ""costly""

\- increasing premium rates, to account for the challenging environment, and with a worst case scenario in mind (continued high morbidity and utilization rate)

\- hinting at a stock buyback in the Earnings call

\- Immune from tariff BS and TACO

# Possible risks

\- The trend of high morbidity and drug use continues to escalate, leading to more people needing expensive surgeries and drugs ==> unlikely, as people who fear that their benefits are being taken away with OBBBA, have already stocked up on drugs/done surgeries

\- continued political pressure on healthcare costs with bills like the OBBBA ==> unlikely, as this bill seems to be a one-and-done on healthcare, and now the Administration will focus on other more pressing matters (Russia - Ukraine conflict, Inflation, crypto, tax bills for the rich etc ...).

Also, this is speculation, but I think the full impact of the OBBBA are wayyy overstated. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that by 2034, 16 million people will lose coverage, but that's a decade away. This will be accounted for in the rate re-pricing.

\- Risks of people changing Insurers because of higher rates ==> given that every Health insurer will be increasing rates, among them: Elevance, UNH, Molina, Blue Cross Blue Shield, CNC will be no exception. People won't switch because none of the other options are better. Centene's health plan is pretty competitive, and compared to Molina health who's the most affordable, Centene's has much better coverage(available across 29 states vs 8 for Molina)

Overall, I think this is a compelling buy, not just for CNC, but for the Health care sector overall, as the benefits greatly outweigh the risk at this point. Historically, the Healthcare Sector has outperformed the S&P, and this is the perfect time to buy in.
You should post it in more subreddits s/ If I'm not mistaken Centene relies on Medicaid for over half of their revenue,  Q2 confirmed the lower memberships are hurting margins too. IMO this is just a gamble. Selling winners to buy one of the biggest losers that is still a falling knife sounds like a winning strategy How the hell is a stock buyback part of a plan back to profitability So you think the combined powers of reducing Medicaid coverage and HHS’s general quackery regarding advisory panels and requirements will lead to better health for an already unhealthy segment of the population? That’s a terrible take, but you do you. Cigna and unh just have flat out better financial and operational positions Take on note that Tim Moore also has been buying this on after falldown.

1mmsr05,2025-08-10,"Exit GOOG/GOOGL or Hold Through Remedies Ruling?
It's my largest position by far and I'm a bit nervous about Department of Justice remedies announcement coming sometime this month.

Thinking of selling 500 or 600 shares and waiting out the month of August until there's clarity around legal headwinds facing the company; then, if it dumps on some harsher than expected verdict (e.g. selling Chrome, forced sharing of search data treasure trove, etc.) get back in at a likely much lower price.

Otherwise, could continue to hold, but it's going to be painful if there's a steep drop coming shortly that everyone knows may happen this month.

Any others with skin in the game have a plan for working around the August announcement? Or maybe it's all priced in and I'm overthinking it, just wait out this particular bump in the road...
I think the remedies decision is the biggest bullish catalyst for Google. Like 90% chance they get slap on the wrist and the anti trust stuff clears. They’ll then get revalued to a PE of rest of the mag 7. So like $300 share price If Google is forced to sell chrome I hope they sell it to a company based in China, see how fast the DOJ starts backtracking. Any ruling is bullish. Clarifies and quantifies risk. This. No way this administration pushes for a harsher outcome; esp. not after all the lobbying work. With the AI race being so important, the admin would be so dumb to break apart Google. I have 1200 shares with a cost basis of $101. I am holding on for this one. Made a mistake of selling my 1000 shares of $COST @ $320. Never again! I’d much rather our big corpos get to AGI before China/Russia that’s for sure. This is my read as well Look at what happened with HPE, this administration is not about punishing a global American corporation no matter what, plus all indications point to the judge taking a very soft stance. GOOG is about to pop 15-20% in my opinion based on the rulings. 

[Google judge mulls softer remedies in US search antitrust case](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/google-doj-make-final-push-us-search-antitrust-case-2025-05-30/) I will definitely hold through. It feels like the market priced in the worst case. Even after the verdict Alphabet will probably not just accept it and so the case will go on for 2 more years. Everything not worst case will probably push the stock quite up. Even in worst case I can see Alphabet being worth more in the long term if the stocks will get seperated.

1mm8vt5,2025-08-10,"Companies that have a moat - lock their customers in
I'm doing research on which companies have a moat to add to my portfolio. Especially with growth. Companies that once customers use their services, it's hard for them to leave, and customers then have to pay the companies over and over again. But I also want them to have high growth for higher return. Feel free to agree/ disagree and suggestion. Thanks. 

NVDA: already 60% of my portfolio. Cuda locks customers in hard. If I pick 1 stock to all in, it's NVDA and I have zero worry. Plan to buy more. 

PLTR: not in my portfolio. crazy PE. But this company's softwares run our government. I'm looking to add next week. 

TSM: in my portfolio. The chip manufacturer for the whole world. No one can replace or even compete with it. 

Microsoft: in my portfolio. Windows. Microsoft's cloud, AI data center. ChatGPT. 

Hood: used to be. Sadly I exited at 62 to switch to NVDA. Now it's exploded. Looking to add back. They have stocks/ crypto brokerage, banking, retirement account. I've been using Robinhood since 2017. Tried other apps as well but nothing can compare. I pay for robinhood gold and use their margin. Of all my picks, this one is the most debatable. But personally I just can't stop using this app. 

Meta: not in my portfolio. FB is where all businesses have to use. And they will keep paying for ads over and over again. I know because I am paying them for ads and for the blue ticker monthly. 

Google: in my portfolio. YouTube. Google's cloud and AI data center. 

Apple: in my portfolio. Apple ecosystem.

If I rate these stocks from best to the least best (best is safest), then:
NVDA 
Microsoft 
Google
Apple
Meta
TSM
PLTR
Hood
ASML has probably the biggest moat out of any company 

The entire semiconductor industry including NVDA and TSM are heavily dependent on their lithography machines Good companies and fairly sane assessment. I would reconsider your HOOD bias. They don't have the moat or customer lock in the other companies in your list do. Most major clients with $1 million portfolios and up will almost always go with a serious brokerage from one of the big banks Seems every other post is a bot these days  1) You are describing like 80% of America 

2) If you look at Robinhood right now and said in 10 years they were the largest player in the finance game, I wouldn’t doubt it. 


Just breaking it down, if you’re 18 and looking to start adulthood Robinhood lets you:

Invest in stocks easier than anywhere else 

Has educational articles on crypto, ETFs, etc 

Gives the easiest access to IPOs 

Lets you hold money in your buying power just like a HYSA at 4% APY

Give you a debit card with a FDIC insured bank account that allows direct deposit

Gives cash back on said debit card on groceries and gas

Offers round ups into any stock, fund, crypto, or allows you to just put it into buying power. 

Is offering a credit card soon 

Gives you a traditional or Roth IRA with 3% match 

Is starting to offer home mortgages. 

Say what you want about Robinhood but their grasp on Millennials, GenZ and soon GenA isn’t going anywhere. It’s a hell of a trick, though. LOL. 

As if what you propose is that easy. Amzn for the same reason you have MSFT. Some massive customers are on AWS and it would be very hard to shift off  ASML RDDT- Where humans have real conversation and discourse about every topic imaginable.

**Full disclosure:** I'm a longstanding TECK holder. It's a large part of my port, I recently added some, and I plan to hold it for many years to come. As such, I'm biased and have a lot to gain by seeing it moon.

On the other hand, I think I'm pretty realistic. I have a decent grasp of the challenges TECK is facing and the lack of excitement about mining stocks in general these days. Concerning the latter, capital tends to flow where it can grow fastest, and mining isn't usually the place do to that. Still, I thought I'd bring this recent news to your attention and see what your thoughts are...

**The Bull Case (""You've got to have Fauth"")**  
On August 8, 2025, Wells Fargo analyst Tiago Fauth reiterated his Overweight rating of TECK with a **$101 price target** ([Source](https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/teck-resources-stock-rating-reiterated-at-overweight-by-wells-fargo-93CH-4179952)). TECK closed at $33.03 on that same day. That's a 206% upside. Fauth calls TECK ""one of the most attractive risk/rewards"" in their coverage, arguing the market's skepticism isn't justified. His confidence seems rooted in:

1. **QB2's Potential:** A belief that once fully operational, this massive copper mine in Chile (which Teck has a 60% stake in) will be a major cash flow machine.
2. **Undervaluation:** Seeing TECK trading at a steep discount to peers, which should narrow as QB2 finally ramps up.
3. **Solid Fundamentals:** Noting Teck's strong liquidity (current ratio of 3.47x).

**The Counterweight (""Reality Check"")**  
While I admit that $101 is an exciting number (even if it strikes me as a bit odd) the stock's current price near $33 (down 39% from its 52-week high) and recent analyst moves tell a different story. Here's where my own caution comes in:

1. **QB2 remains the core challenge:** This project has been plagued by delays and cost overruns, and most recently, issues with the tailings management plant and shiploader. In the second quarter, results of which were reported on July 24, copper sales missed expectations, adjusted EBITDA came in slightly below estimates and, critically, Teck had to lower its 2025 production guidance because of ongoing QB2 ramp-up difficultes (e,g, tailings, shiploader). Thus, Fauth's these majorly hinges on QB2 finally hitting its stride smoothly and soon.
2. **Fauth's view is an outlier:** The consensus analyst price target sits between $43 and $44, depending on the source. And recent analyst actions have been cautious:
   * JPMorgan downgraded TECK from Overweight to Neutral.
   * B.Riley moved from Buy to Neutral and cut its target.
   * Benchmark, Jefferies, and Raymond James all reduced their targets (though some kept Buy ratings). The common thread? Concerns about QB2's timeline, execution risks and the impact on near-term performance.
3. **Macro Headwinds Persist:** China's struggling property sector (a huge copper consumer) continues to weigh on demand sentiment. Global growth remains uncertain and copper prices are inherently volatile.

**My Take as a Shareholder:**  
I own TECK because I believe in the long-term copper story (though it does tend to get overhyped at times), and QB2's *potential*. While I can't say I have as much faith as Fauth --a $101 price target seems a bit of a stretch-- it does illustrate how big the upside *could* be if a lot things go perfectly right. As I said at the start of this post, I'm in it for the long term. Very long. Until we see consistent, positive operational progress on QB2, however, I expect it to trade near where it's at, which may prove to big a big buying opportunity...or not.

**What are your thoughts?** Is Wells Fargo seeing something fundamental that the rest of the market (and other analysts) is missing? Or does the $101 target seem disconnected from Teck's current operational reality? Is mining --not BItcoin, but actual rocks from the ground-- something you even consider investing in? I'm keen to hear different perspectives.

Thanks for listening.
Never heard of TECK so I won’t comment on it, but analyst price targets mean absolutely nothing. The street is hyper bullish on their coverage because it encourages deal flow and good relations with management. Don’t take their price targets at face value As a contractor who has done work for some of Teck’s operations in Canada they have no clue what they’re doing and throw money away, just my two cents I have no positions. I believe in the copper story but Teck is one of the worst run mining companies out there.  SCCO is best of breed for copper, Ivanhoe mines or First Quantum if you want to speculate. That analyst has a 44% success rate, and an average of 2% return on those success. 


Thanks, but no thanks  Thanks for sharing. I value this kind of feedback. I've heard good things from some who work for Teck, but your comment about throwing money away does track with their mishaps/difficulties over the years (e.g. the oil sands project). TECK is, by its nature, not a longterm hold.

It can make you fantastic amounts of money… if you perfectly understand the cyclical nature of Canadian mining stocks and are able to accurately time your buy and sell.

Please see the chart since 2002. Agreed. Let’s hope ..I actually own this dog ..😉 JPM and MS have both downgraded in the past month and have low 40s targets.  Trusting an outlier analyst is a quick way to go broke. Thanks for sharing. I value your feedback, positive or negative. Teck has definitely had some challenges.

My question may as well go here...

Almost a year ago I made a bet on COMM. For the last 90 days they've traded over 5 and steadily grew into the 7's. They announce they're selling part of their business and it went up like 70% on Monday and by closing Friday it's over $15. This fixes all their debt problems but also loses their biggest earner. I'm guessing the stock shot up because they announced some of the excess cash will go to a dividend when the deal closes in early 2026. 

Every time something I have rapidly blows up 100% or more (like TSLA and AMD did) I cash out and run. Then I watch it go up and up. I don't see COMM going to the moon like those but maybe it can just be a healthy company again. I suspect it may crash the second everyone gets their dividend check. But the company also got several upgraded ratings and would seem to be in a good position to pivot or expand into whatever they want. 

Take the money and run on Monday?

Sell the day before the dividend?

Hey. You. Yes you. The market is closed. 


Stop reading this and go spend time with your family You bozos are my only family It's overvalued by every possible metric. Investment just hit $100k! Woohoo! First milestone, $200k next! They could also all pull it at the same time. I mean, what happened in April? It went down 20%. It wasn't sustained not because of retail but because macro changed. The tariffs reversed.


If they hadn't, and it went down another 10%, I think you would have seen people get nervous and pull their money just like every other crash. Then companies get nervous, lay off, more are forced to sell etc. And it's easier for them to sell, like you said. 


The recipe for a crash is clearly still valid.  RDDT is posting daily active user gains according to semrush data. They just dropped a quarter that has 76% YOY revenue growth. They have no debt on their balance sheet. Turning into an amazing growth company. I think they are just getting started with ads as well. So much upward potential being a top 10 website and only valued at 40 billion. So it's not too late to jump on the RDDT band wagon? I feel I've already missed the initial gains. A lot of people seem to forget that current valuations are very atypical. The Shiller P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is 38.15. The only other times in history it was near this level were 1929 and 1999, both just before large market crashes. The P/E ratio is 29. Can't expect current valuations to persist. Look at whatever metric you like. Valuations are high. There's zero doubt about that.

1mlhokv,2025-08-09,"Made a huge mistake investing a lot into ETFs
As a first time investor, I made the mistake of investing 30k at 37 years old into VOO around November 2024. I was DCAing about 5k per month and had hit about 50k before the market crashed in April. Unfortunately, I did not have a lot of cash on the sidelines and I wanted to build an emergency fund, so I did just that. I saved 15k, but I missed out on a lot of opportunities in the market. I did have a chance to buy Google, Amazon and VOO when the market was low, but not much (only 2500 of each). I have since added about another 5k of Google, 1k of Amazon, and 2.5k of UNH. I am only up 10% since November. I  feel bad seeing many people up 30% to 70% year to date, while I have nowhere near those returns. Unfortunately I did not have the cash ready to invest when the market was down, and chose to build an emergency fund instead. I also started a position in PLTR in November at $58 before buying VOO, but did not trust it and sold out due to fear of the unknown. As we all know now, that was a huge mistake. I am now focused on buying individual stocks, and will not make the same mistake of lump summing money into an ETF. What are some mistakes that you have made in the market? How did you learn and come back from them?

You’re upset you’re only up 10% in a year? Your mistake wasn’t buying VOO. You more than anyone should be buying VOO In 9 months!  You also missed out a lot of potential loss too by sticking with ETFs. You are having this conversation because you think about the money you could have made instead of money you could have lost. You should just balance your investment strategy with some ETF and some stocks. Here we go again Building that emergency fund wasn’t a mistake  it’s insurance. Missed rallies hurt, but cash + patience beats panic every time word of advice - you are not cut out for individual stocks. drop the ego and just stick to etfs You could have also bought UNH in november guess what would happen now, etf covers that... If something happens and Trump cuts of PLTR you know what will hapen... of course ETF's dont do 100% ytd but ya know... it aint crashing and if it would, we would be too fucked to care abt it It is safter to invest in VOO than individual stocks.

1mlf06m,2025-08-09,"RDDT - which advertisers are paying $$$ ??
I made money shorting RDDT after the first record high. Now I want to do it again but their earnings report is stupefying to me. How can they be pulling in that much dough from advertisers? I never even notice ads on here. I can't believe advertisers would pay a lot to RDDT in the apparent belief that redditors are going to turn into big time paying customers. (?)  
Cramer said ""amazing digital advertising business because it’s basically the last bastion of the old school internet""  WTF?  That makes no sense to me. What am I missing?

EDIT:  To respond to some of the resultant conjecture below:   
1 AI says ""*Reddit’s dominant income source continues to be advertising—ranging from* ***84% to nearly 98%****, depending on the period and granularity observed. Revenue from data licensing (i.e., “selling data” to AI firms) remains relatively minor, generally in the* ***low single-digit to low double-digit percent*** *range of total revenue.*""  
2 Its super high PE indicates high expectations -- PE is not proof of an eventual outcome. The dotcom bubble was riddled with high PEs.  
3 This 'great company' as someone commented, and a great deal of its userbase constitute a cesspool. From a returned-CEO caught rigging interactions to ""communities"" openly flowing with hate for others, it can never provide paying advertisers the return they now think they're getting-- any more than NXDR did. It has the same web of fifedoms where humans inevitably run their community in variant and non contrubitive ways. Its Q424 news letter is full of unprovable and exaggerated puffery to keep the mirage (to advertisers) going; I'm calling BS on their DAUq tallies. This mirage can't last. META towers over RDDT because, though it has groups, META is user-centric and therefore localized fiefdoms can't trod on META users like they do in RDDT and NXDR. The truth always eventually comes out and so advertisers will some day learn this. If you want to argue this, take a look at Bytedance's TikTok and answer for yourself why it will never be publicly traded. 

Thanks for the few who posted helpful responses. Some responses were predictable or simply wrong, and I provided links in more comments.


Just use the official Reddit app. There are ads embedded in threads everyone knows shorting great companies that are growing fast is the key to success Cramer is spot on.  I am in a sub, I see ads targeted at my interests and comments. Idk the advertiser haven’t seemed to realise Facebook is just full of bots and they still waste money on it They have a lot of targeting data based on what you’re viewing so they must have determined you need to borrow money and the advertisers are willing to pay for you to see their ads Yeah been seeing a ton of moneylending ones… Based on the ads I get on Reddit, I wonder if they think I am literally a gay bear. Honestly the targeting is really not good. Speaking as someone who has clients using Reddit ads. With the data Reddit has it should be a lot better. If they don’t figure it out and make it more effective the ad revenue is probably going to plateau around where Twitter/Snap/Pinterest is. Advertisers, or selling data?

1mleoyz,2025-08-09,"How are stocks priced to demand?
To clarify my question is basically how much does a stock’s price increase when there’s for example 100 buyers and 99 sellers. Obviously the stock price would go up but by what amount? i’ve looked this up on google but didn’t find any conclusive answer. 
What if you have 100 buyers willing to pay $1 per share, but 99 sellers only willing to accept $2 per share? There are more variables to consider than just volume of buyers and sellers The ""price"" is whatever the last traded price is Very few accurate answers here. 

The price you see is the ""mark"" and generally resides between the bid and ask prices. 

If I own a share and am willing to sell it for 100 then I can place a sell order there. If a buyer is only willing to pay 98 they aren't going to be able to buy my share. If we are the only two people in the market you'd see a stock price of 99 and the bid/ask spread of 2. 

If you create a market order you will ""cross the spread"" and pay the price the seller is offering, in this case 100 and you create buying or upward pressure on the stock.

If I, on the other hand, do a market sell, I may sell for less than the 100 I wanted, creating selling or downward pressure. 

In reality, and to maintain liquidity, you have marker makers. They will be the ones actually buying your shares in many cases and then selling them to others. They make profit because of the bid ask spread, they pocket the pennies in between but the sheer volume of trades they make means they make significant profits This is the answer. If OP reads how market makers work, that will answer the question. Read about market making It goes up if sellers want to sell for more than current price and buyers pay it Your obviously situation could be wrong in lots of situations. 

What if the 99 sellers all are willing to accept a price at least 5% below the current ? You need the bid and ask prices Last recorded price is only the best estimate of the market price. Sometimes the spread between bid and ask grows so wide that there effectively is no established market price or existing market aka the market is illiquid. There isn't a set amount and there's multiple variables, like how many sellers there are vs buyers.

1ml3134,2025-08-08,"what is the best metric to use for highlighting market share of a company in a specific industry?
Hi, i'm trying to visualize market shares of companies in a given industry like airlines, cars etc. I was thinking of using market cap, but it seems too subjective (like how much people trust that company as opposed to how well it's doing). is total revenue a good metric or is it too rough for market share indicator?

also, at the moment i'm limited by public companies simply because i dont have a resource for private companies. i had a look online and orbis database seems exactly what i need but it's way too expensive. do you know something similar that's free to use?

another question, i use finbox screener for getting public company data. exporting tables requires a paid account so i copy-paste then transpose in google sheets. if you know any websites that allow exporting, that'd be great. the option is locked for some reason in yahoo finance, and trading view only exports a single chart i think, not a list.

1ml05ro,2025-08-08,"Cover Call/Options Strategy ETFs
I'm trying to build some dividend yielding ETFs in my Roth so I can continue to produce capital tax free and invest I've been looking at SPYI and QQQI and wondering what the big con is? I know they pay out 10%+ in annual yield and you don't get any of the gains when the market goes up but I'm strictly just looking for yields at this point. I have a fair share of SCHD and some DGRO but was thinking about setting aside some amounts to SPYI, QQQI, and JEPQ. From what I understand and historically they have been fairly stable but we have been in insane bull market since covid. I know they are also knew but past performance doesn't indicate future performance.
The big ""con"" is that they tend to underperform and you're essentially betting on market timing to make them worthwhile. I would avoid and just stick to vanilla index funds. Max downside for a covered call is $0 + the value of the contract, which is pennies on the dollar relative to the underlying. Once you blow past the breakeven point, the free fall is similar to buy and hold.

And no, the trade-off for the upside cap is protection against slow bleeds and small disruptions. The strategy is inefficient with respect to large unpriced moves in either direction. ya but those look to good to be true lol. I haven't done the adequate research on them tbh but anything paying out 130% you're probably losing out somehow and I'm sure there are some downsides to it. I don't invest in anything until I know the ins-n-outs lol too much junk out there It's not,  ymax pays a dividend of roughly 1%-2% per week, other etfs they run pay out monthly. just got my dividend from them. The downside is since they're selling covered calls the upside is limited and same issue with them selling puts since they can get locked into a higher cost basis position than current price. 

You can check them out at www.yieldmaxetfs.com to get the full image There is no big con: your returns will replicate writing your own covered calls minus the expense ratio (which can be big).   Covered calls are a neutral to bullish strategy with lower returns than owning shares.   

Basically, these products are like buying SPY with a portion of your money: they replicate capital inefficiency while holding a lot of downside risk. Have you looked into yieldmax ETFs? I'm not recommending them persay but I do have a small position in my Roth in ULTY and it's dividend payout is 130%. Elaborate on the downside risk? is this just not a covered call strategy that they are doing?

Would your downside also be limited in a bear market as your upside in a bull market? I have some JEPQ in mine.  If it holds, it’ll be a nice little source of retirement income.

But the better move is to build up enough shares of long term stock or ETF to sell your own CC’s.  For example: if you own 100 shares of SPY, you can sell covered calls and safely make at least $30-$60 a day. That’s $9k-$15k a year, which is significantly more than your annual contributions.",2,1.0,8,0,Vast_Newt_1799,stocks,['SPY'],cover calloptions strategy etfs im trying build dividend yielding etfs roth continue produce capital tax free invest ive looking spyi qqqi wondering big con know pay 10 annual yield dont get gains market goes im strictly looking yields point fair share schd dgro thinking setting aside amounts spyi qqqi jepq understand historically fairly stable insane bull market since covid know also knew past performance doesnt indicate future performance big con tend underperform youre essentially betting market timing make worthwhile would avoid stick vanilla index funds max downside covered call 0 value contract pennies dollar relative underlying blow past breakeven point free fall similar buy hold tradeoff upside cap protection slow bleeds small disruptions strategy inefficient respect large unpriced moves either direction ya look good true lol havent done adequate research tbh anything paying 130 youre probably losing somehow im sure downsides dont invest anything know insnouts lol much junk ymax pays dividend roughly 12 per week etfs run pay monthly got dividend downside since theyre selling covered calls upside limited issue selling puts since get locked higher cost basis position current price check wwwyieldmaxetfscom get full image big con returns replicate writing covered calls minus expense ratio big covered calls neutral bullish strategy lower returns owning shares basically products like buying spy portion money replicate capital inefficiency holding lot downside risk looked yieldmax etfs im recommending persay small position roth ulty dividend payout 130 elaborate downside risk covered call strategy would downside also limited bear market upside bull market jepq mine holds itll nice little source retirement income better move build enough shares long term stock etf sell ccs example 100 shares spy sell covered calls safely make least 3060 day thats 9k15k year significantly annual contributions
1mkzgmj,2025-08-08,"You don’t own enough Google- Another “Google is undervalued” post
OpenAI just released their frontier model and suffice to say… it flopped. 

People are waiting with bated breath to see what Google has cooked up. They already released Genie 3, which nobody is even close to yet on world models. I think it will be trivial for them to surpass or at least catch up to OpenAI on the intelligence front for frontier LMM. And they have always been better than other AI companies from a context length and cost perspective. 

Just from an AI front, Google is killing it. Their narrow AI is winning Nobel prizes with Alphafold. Discovering algorithms with AlphaEvolve. Advancing robotics. 

Even if you don’t think Google will win the AI race to general intelligence or don’t even believe anyone will get there (which is the long term “this stock will absolutely explode if they hit AGI” bet):


let’s just look at valuations:

If OpenAI is valued at $500b then Deepmind is easily $500b. 

If Netflix is $500b then Youtube is easily $700b. 

Search is easily $1-2T. 

Now we are sitting around Googles current $2.5T valuation. 

But there’s more! 

How much is Google Cloud worth? Easily $300+ billion just based on current revenue. 

This is part of cloud but how much is their tensor chip tech alone worth? AI specific compute that’s competitive to Nvidia? Short answer is: a lot. 

If Tesla is worth $1T partly off self driving car hype, how much is Waymo worth? Easily $100-200b. 

How much is the Android/Google Play business worth? 

How much is every app that we all use daily worth? (Chrome, Maps, Gmail, Docs, Drive, etc)


I know this has been said before but Google is literally a competitor to every single major Tech companies business. They have their hands in every single pot. Whilst, they have historically had issues with marketing and selling their product, their product suite *is good*. They don’t just have a useless competitor like bing is to their search, they actually put up real competition like Google Docs is to Word. 

People talk about the risk of Google getting broken up but that might be the best thing for investors. The individual parts of Google are so valuable that forcing the market to value them separately might actually unlock value. It wouldn’t be crazy if a breakup made investors richer, not poorer (at least in the short term). The market would finally have to pull its head out of its ass and price these pieces properly. (Edit: This part is hyperbole to make a point, I don’t actually think a breakup would be good for investors) 
Haven't used google in over 20 years besides youtube, gmail, chrome, gemini, waymo.  Besides that its trash. Whenever I'm in foreign countries trying to read signs, it always use Bing translate......said nobody ever. Tesla is not worth 1T, Netflix is not worth 500B, OpenAI is not worth 500B. Besides, your “If A is worth B, then X is worth Y” reasoning is off. You are basically saying the market values all companies correctly, except Google? The problem with google is that they are always technologically superior but seem to have trouble with building awesome business out of their tech

They did cloud computing internally before AWS was a thing

Their voice assistant technology was superior to Alexa since I remember

Their AI and language understanding tech was also superior to anything anyone else had before OpenAI released gpt3

I don't get it why they flop so much on monetizing their amazing tech but I wouldn't be surprised if we will see repeat of that - googles assistant will be state of the art and best models while someone else makes money on that on something inferior but much better with making money I just Ask Jeeves And they're way ahead in self-driving cars, but people talk about Tesla as if it were equivalent to Waymo.

It lacks the ability to hype itself. The big issue is that Google has too many good businesses in one, and so that causes people to look for a simpler way to value the business, and the only way they can think of doing so is by viewing it as a search company lol. ...Google Maps, Waze, G-Suite (docs, sheets, etc.) Lol Every time anybody uses any Google product, they train their AI model...

ChatGPT has not replaced Google for the majority of the population...

Get out before you get wrecked Buys leveraged security, doesn’t know how leveraged securities work. Nice. Don't buy leveraged products if you don't understand leveraged products. I'm not informed enough to answer your question but from what I understand, leveraged stocks are meant to be day traded rather than held over a period of time. Losses are magnified more than gains. If the stock price stays the same, the leveraged stocks will lose money. Someone else can explain why. Anyway, I stay away from leveraged stocks because I don't understand them. Sorry if this is a useless answer. Wanna know how one day my account dropped 15k in a few seconds?

Big stupid levers, that’s how Guy asks for an explanation and everyone here is giving him shit for trying to understand better. Like he's doing the thing you are saying he should do. SMH It's mathematical. If a stock goes down 6% then up 6%, you're actually still down on your initial investment because you went up by 6% on a smaller number than what you went down by 6% on. Adding leverage to these mechanics means you're amplifying that loss. 

If a stock is not consistently going up, but instead fluctuating between down and up days, even if the general trend is up you will not be making 3x on an 3x leverage investment for that reason. Plus depending on the vehicle there can be quite sizeable fees that eat into your return even further. You are playing with dangerous financial instruments you dont understand at all Say something drops 10% and then goes up 10%, it isn’t actually break even. 100 drops to 90 and then raises 10% to 99% - that is what is happening here, but at 3x the effect.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Ahem, calls! 

Tesla Inc. is disbanding its Dojo supercomputer team and its leader will depart the company, according to people familiar with the matter, upending the automaker’s effort to develop in-house chips for driverless technology.

Peter Bannon, who was heading up Dojo, is leaving and Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has ordered the effort to be shut down, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. The team has lost about 20 workers recently to newly formed DensityAI, and remaining Dojo workers are being reassigned to other data center and compute projects within Tesla, the people said.
I heard Cathie Woods just raised her price target Hey Tesla bros 

Get ready to be forced to buy xAI for the hilarious AI valuations being tossed around. Except this time, it comes after Elon dispersed your GPUs to xAI and then disbanded your Dojo team.

1mkcur7,2025-08-07,"I’m seriously considering consolidating my entire portfolio into Apple (AAPL)
So here’s what I’m wrestling with:
Why shouldn’t I sell my Amazon and AMD positions and go all-in on Apple? ( I already got some apple shares ) 
Am I overlooking some major risk with Apple that others see?
Is this level of concentration just asking for trouble or is it conviction?
Apple feels “boring,” but is boring what wins?
Would I regret not having exposure to AMD’s AI upside or Amazon’s cloud/growth potential in 5 years?
Is Apple too big to generate the same returns going forward?
Apple is growing mid single digits every year and has a higher valuation than meta and Google who both grow large double digits. Apple has struggled significantly with AI and has lower margins than both of the latter companies. I don’t see why you would pick Apple out of all the MAG7 to full-port into (which also is a terrible idea to do to any company) You’re a fool.

Oh shit this is /r/stocks and not /r/personalfinance

Go for it mate despite how some imbeciles will mock u or other index huggers will write u off, you're on the right track. all the greats like w. f o'neil, buffett, etc made their vast fortunes by essentially placing as many eggs in as few baskets as possible. buffet himself said diversification is a hedge against ignorance but isnt necessary if u know what youre doing. im long RUM \[rddt, uber, meta\] and thats all i buy every month whn i get paid.

u dont need to own a ton of stocks and u can be bolder than all the index huggers and more successful. Take a look at CISCo stock which peaked around March 2000 and then ask yourself if it’s a good idea to go all-in on 1 stock because it’s the “big and popular” or whatever your heuristic is. Did the Google search see Gemini’s response below .. growth is stagnating for Apple, overall revenue is greater at Apple, but Google being SAAS and a cloud provider has better margins. 

Apple's and Google's (Alphabet's) revenue growth rates show a mixed picture depending on the time period considered:
Recent quarterly growth (Q2 2025)
Google (Alphabet): Alphabet reported a 14% year-over-year increase in consolidated revenues to $96.4 billion.
Apple: Apple's revenue grew 5% year-over-year, reaching $95.4 billion. 

Last 12 months (ending June 30, 2025)
Google (Alphabet): Alphabet's revenue for the trailing twelve months was $371.40 billion, representing a 13.13% year-over-year increase.
Apple: Apple's revenue for the twelve months ending March 31, 2025, was $400.366 billion, a 4.91% increase year-over-year. A grown ass man asking the internet why he should or shouldn’t put all his eggs into one basket 😂 Long rddt over here also! qqq I would advice against putting all your eggs in one basket even if it is one of the biggest safest baskets around.

1mk40tz,2025-08-07,"I think the market overreacted to CROX earnings
Hello, here are some key takeaways from their earnings: 

Today theyre trading at about 80$ a share, 4.4B market cap. Down over 20% in reaction today, so here are some numbers they reported 


Returned over 200M to shareholders, over 100M in debt pay down and share buybacks each

Revenue grew 3% to 1149M, non-GAAP EPS up 5% to 4.23

47% of their revenue is international (not affected by taco tarriffs) and that segment revenue grew 16% YoY

So why the drop? They removed full year guidance and next quarter are projecting 9-11% revenue loss YoY due to the tarriff man 

My positions: I bought 160 shares today,  150 of them on margin

Thank you for reading, what are your thoughts?
They didn’t remove guidance? They forecasted negative growth which is considerably worse. -9% revenue y/y is nothing to scoff at, and I’d say it warrants a significant punishment, granted the valuation was already very low. The impairment of HEYDUDE just shows how weak the brand has gotten. -6% growth in NA is worrying, though international was better than expected

All in all, crocs has a lot it needs to turnaround, and its cheap valuation is really its only redeeming factor, though it’s cheap for a reason Are Crocs a fashion industry fad? 10-Year Revenue CAGR 15%; 10-Year EPS CAGR 50%; 10-Year Cash Flow from Operations CAGR 61%; 10-Year Equity CAGR 17%. A decade of double-digit growth across the most important financial metrics isn’t a fad, it’s a quality company. If Mr. Market is off his medication and wants to sell it to me this cheaply, I say “Thank you; more please.” My position: 1 old pair of Crocs that I will never replace because they are now $75 I bought some today too, because it still is a sound company who will rebound so it's hard to resist the great discount.

One thing I will never do though is to invest with money I do not have. Because gaining these extra won't be life-changing (at least for this situation), but losing them will really be a hot mess. Yup, I don't understand this drop at all. Will defenitely look to buy some I also bought some shares today. It's an overreaction and CROX will continue to grow as it had for the past two decades. You pick up any shares today? I want more but Im spread thin Thanks, I updated the post 

guess they only removed full year guidance but they still did project q3

Im in due to their aggressive policy returning capital to shareholders

1mk3yov,2025-08-07,"Uber in talks with banks, private equity firms to fund Waymo expansion
Uber (UBER.N), opens new tab is in talks with private equity firms and banks to secure funds to build its robotaxi business, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said, as the ride-hailing giant bets on a mass roll-out of the nascent and much-scrutinized technology.


Uber, which offers robotaxis from Alphabet (GOOGL.O), opens new tab-owned Waymo, has been strengthening its foothold in the self-driving taxi industry through partnerships with automakers such as Volkswagen (VOWG.DE), opens new tab and Lucid (LCID.O), opens new tab, just as Tesla (TSLA.O), opens new tab seeks to expand its fledgling robotaxi business.

Khosrowshahi on Wednesday pitched the tie-ups as part of a larger plan that involves three robotaxi business models: paying partners that own such vehicles a fixed rate, sharing revenue with fleet operators and owning vehicles while licensing software for self-driving technology.


""We are talking to private equity players, we have talked to banks,"" the CEO said. ""Once we prove the revenue model, how much these cars can generate on a per day basis, there will be plenty of financing to go around.""
For now, Uber said it was planning on using a ""modest"" portion of its around $7 billion in annual cash flows to fund deployments. It might also sell minority stakes in companies to aid the expansion, it said.


Analysts have said that mass robotaxi deployment could lower driver-reliant Uber's operating costs and boost profitability.
The company has been offering Waymo robotaxis on its ride-hailing app in Austin, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia. In April, Uber entered a deal with Volkswagen for thousands of autonomous electric vans in the United States over the next decade.


https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uber-talks-with-banks-private-equity-firms-fund-robotaxi-expansion-2025-08-06/

GOOG not $200 is a crime against humanity. GOOBER Opens new tab huh? Buy back announcements are often misunderstood. It just means the board has authorized the company to purchase up to $20b of shares by a certain date.  It does not mean the company will actually follow through with any portion of it - they could end up spending $0, $20b or somewhere in between.  UBER only has $7b in cash on the books today, so it sounds like a lot more bark, than bite.

Regarding the fund raising, the board and leadership of any publicly traded company has a fudiciary responsiblity to maximize shareholder return.  When you have an established business model that is growing and profitable, it's difficult to get backing for a new investment venture that may or may not pan out.  Per the report, UBER said their model is years away from profitablity.  That would mean an EPS hit for existing UBER shareholders (for years) which would certainly pressure the share price and perhaps lead to exists due to new risk exposure; if the venture is funded say through share offering and dillution. I hope they’ll be able to pay the tab… Did he think about issuing equity for buybacks?

More specifically, why are they buying $20bn of shares supposedly if they also need to raise cash for robotaxi partnerships and expansions? Calls on UBER or GOOG? Or both? Shhh You should really open a new tab Can’t wait… let’s see how Uber will manage this mess.. right now, Waymo is  still losing money. Economies of scale theoretically should make it profitable but in major cities like NY, Chicago, SFO, Paris, London…real estate is a premium..EVs have limited range, logistics is a major challenge. Maintenance - cleaning, charging, repairs will require a depot not just charging stations. Insurance is another matter. Let’s see how profitable the personal transportation business will be when Uber will finally incur all the cost/mile driven instead of the human drivers and Waymo - Lidar fitted jaguar cars cost $250,000 each…without Tariffs - this should go down, how much lower? only Uber can negotiate that.",55,0.87,13,0,Anonymous157,stocks,"['TSLA', 'GOOGL']",uber talks banks private equity firms fund waymo expansion uber ubern opens new tab talks private equity firms banks secure funds build robotaxi business ceo dara khosrowshahi said ridehailing giant bets mass rollout nascent muchscrutinized technology uber offers robotaxis alphabet googlo opens new tabowned waymo strengthening foothold selfdriving taxi industry partnerships automakers volkswagen vowgde opens new tab lucid lcido opens new tab tesla tslao opens new tab seeks expand fledgling robotaxi business khosrowshahi wednesday pitched tieups part larger plan involves three robotaxi business models paying partners vehicles fixed rate sharing revenue fleet operators owning vehicles licensing software selfdriving technology talking private equity players talked banks ceo said prove revenue model much cars generate per day basis plenty financing go around uber said planning using modest portion around 7 billion annual cash flows fund deployments might also sell minority stakes companies aid expansion said analysts said mass robotaxi deployment could lower driverreliant ubers operating costs boost profitability company offering waymo robotaxis ridehailing app austin texas atlanta georgia april uber entered deal volkswagen thousands autonomous electric vans united states next decade goog 200 crime humanity goober opens new tab huh buy back announcements often misunderstood means board authorized company purchase 20b shares certain date mean company actually follow portion could end spending 0 20b somewhere uber 7b cash books today sounds like lot bark bite regarding fund raising board leadership publicly traded company fudiciary responsiblity maximize shareholder return established business model growing profitable difficult get backing new investment venture may may pan per report uber said model years away profitablity would mean eps hit existing uber shareholders years would certainly pressure share price perhaps lead exists due new risk exposure venture funded say share offering dillution hope theyll able pay tab think issuing equity buybacks specifically buying 20bn shares supposedly also need raise cash robotaxi partnerships expansions calls uber goog shhh really open new tab cant wait lets see uber manage mess right waymo still losing money economies scale theoretically make profitable major cities like ny chicago sfo paris londonreal estate premiumevs limited range logistics major challenge maintenance cleaning charging repairs require depot charging stations insurance another matter lets see profitable personal transportation business uber finally incur costmile driven instead human drivers waymo lidar fitted jaguar cars cost 250000 eachwithout tariffs go much lower uber negotiate
1mk0xc0,2025-08-07,"Can the Firefly IPO... Fly? (DD on $FLY)
# I love IPOs!!!!!!!!!!

The last IPO I thought was amazing was Figma [(it's been a week lol).](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ma8fm5/figuring_out_the_figma_ipo_dd_on_fig/) Firefly is opening today and there is, to put it lightly, hype.

**Can Firefly Fly? You would not believe your eyes, etc etc.**

Firefly Aerospace Inc. is a Texas-based space and defense technology founded in 2017 that provides ""end-to-end mission solutions for government and commercial clients"". They **design, manufacture, and operate** their own rockets and spacecraft with vertically integrated production facilities.

Firefly’s business has two main segments: Launch Services (delivering satellites and payloads to orbit) and Spacecraft Solutions (building vehicles like lunar landers and orbital transfer tugs). Its flagship Alpha rocket [(Link to one of their rockets) ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_Alpha)is a small-lift launcher (\~2K lbs to low Earth orbit) that first reached orbit in 2022 and has since completed four orbital missions. On the spacecraft side, the Blue Ghost lander landed on the Moon landing in March 2025, and are developing Elytra orbital vehicles for satellite deployment and lunar data relay services. Firefly positions itself as a one-stop shop for space missions, combining launch vehicles, lunar landers, and in-orbit services to meet demand from national security and commercial customers seeking rapid access to space. Looking ahead, Firefly is expanding into medium-lift launch with Eclipse**,** a larger, partially reusable rocket co-developed with Northrop Grumman.

**FireFly Financials (Lighting cash on fire, in addition to flies)**

Firefly is **unprofitable due to heavily investing in R&D/production. This is expected for a company that require massive upfront capital and long development cycles before achieving commercial scale**. Doubly so for spaceflight companies. 

# Metrics (USD Millions)

|Metric|FY 2023|FY 2024|Q1 2024|Q1 2025|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Revenue**|$55.2|$60.8|$8.3|$55.9|
|**Gross Profit**|$26.6|–$11.4|–$1.9|$2.2|
|**Gross Margin**|48.2%|–18.7%|–23.1%|4.0%|
|**Operating Income**|–$131.9|–$209.5|–$49.1|–$58.5|
|**Net Income**|–$135.5|–$231.1|–$52.8|–$60.1|

**Note: There is no information from 2022, the financial information in this S-1 is notably sparse.** 

The company’s **net losses are deepening**. Firefly reported a **$231.1 million net loss in 2024,** mainly due to heavy spending on development. R&D expense alone was $149.5 million in 2024! In Q1 2025, Firefly lost another $60.1 million despite the revenue jump. 

**Firefly acknowledges that it** **does not expect to be profitable for several years as it scales production and develops new vehicles.**

As of March 31, 2025, the company had **$176.9 million in cash** on hand, but also carried **$147.7 million in debt**. The IPO proceeds (targeting \~$600+ million) are thus crucial to replenish cash. Ironically, this is what IPOs are meant for- securing more cash in order to stay alive (in addition to gaining liquidity for their shares). Gross margin was negative in 2024 (119% of revenue), and operating/net margins are negative as well. Firefly NEEDS massive revenue scaling and more launches to absorb the MASSIVE (low-taper fade) cost base they've spent. 

On the flip side, demand is very, very high. FireFly reported a $1.1B backlog as of their S-1 filing, nearly double what they had end of 2023, and have contracts with the US government and defense primes (companies with direct links to the government like LMT/BA/NOC).

Something interesting I read in the S1 was that that 95% of the 2024 revenue came from three customers- (speculated to be NASA, USAF, and someone unknown) so revenue is lumpy, as it usually is with these contract based companies). 

**Shareholders/Funding History**

The company’s largest shareholder is AE Industrial Partners (AEI), a aerospace-focused private equity firm. AEI made its initial investment in Firefly in 2022 to acquire a controlling stake from the prior owner and will own \~42% of the company, and control >50% of voting power post-IPO. Firefly’s current Chairman, Kirk Konert, is a partner at AEI, and AEI led multiple funding rounds. For all intents and purposes, I consider AEI to own Firefly. 

Aside from AEI, key investors include strategic partners and venture firms like Northrop Grumman and Astera Institute, a nonprofit/VC entity, which owns about 10% pre-IPO. Tom Markusic, Firefly’s co-founder and former CEO, owns roughly 9-10% stake pre-IPO. There's a lot more I can go into but there IS a decent amount of demand for these shares, and the current cap table is dominated by AEI, Northrop, Astera, and management. **No existing stockholders are selling in the IPO (based on the S1), so this isn't a quick dump on retail from shareholders.** 

**Risks** 

**Firefly has never been profitable and has stated it expects to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. It is entirely reliant on external funding, and looking at their financials, it looks completely possible they will dilute shareholders further within a year of IPOing.** 

Rockets themselves are risky, they can experience launch failures, delays, explosions, same stuff that we've seen with SpaceX rockets. If you need a reference point look up what happened when other spaceflight companies couldn't get their launches on time, the stock would tank. Tariffs are also likely to affect this company materially, and the space market is cutthroat and Firefly is late to the party. In launch services, SpaceX, are already the major players Rocket Lab. In lunar landers, it has to compete with LUNR and other private companies developing the same. 

As noted before, revenue is highly tied to government contracts and a few key customers (US governmental agencies and defense contractors). If we ever have a president that likes to change his mind a lot, this could be a serious problem. Regulations can also hinder Firefly's business operations (FAA launch licenses, export controls, FCC licenses, environmental studies (pretty sure SpaceX ignores these lol), and can hinder/suspend operations. 

**TL;DR** Firefly is pretty much a typical risky space startup- there's execution risk, market risk, geopolitical risk, political risk, technical risk, funding/financial risk, competitor risk, ownership risk, rocketships blowing up risk. The company isn't profitable, will likely dilute their shareholders and is owned by a PE firm (which is not a great sign). It DOES have technology that performs (they can actually land on the moon) and a decently sized backlog, but the financials are disastrous and the IPO valuation is currently at 90x 2024 sales. 

Thinking back on my Figma DD, I liked Figma because literally any UX developer could tell you how useful Figma was to their job and how it dominates the industry, but FLY seems like a small puppy owned by a puppy mill breeder (AEI) dropped off into a den of feral pitbulls. The ownership by AEI is a huge concern of mine and essentially a nail in the coffin of why I'm not interested in a long-term investment. 

Is this going to be something like RKLB, or something closer to Virgin Galactic which had a hype run? The company seems cool in concept, but I'm leaning the latter. 

But hey, in the words of Roman Roy from Succession: ""I don’t mean to be facetious but, Sarah, on that point - I’m not a rocket scientist""

 
2.5/6 launches successful compared to 65/69 for RKLB for what it's worth So many rocket companies So much risk, but it's already valued at $9B hmmmmm, pretty sure there'll better time to pick up shares in this one I got 5 at 68.20 - so already in the red 😂 Firefly needed (used) rocket labs tech to help get and land on the moon as well. Fly is interesting but it’s not in the same league as rocket lab They're really TAKING OFF (i'll show myself out now) They're priced at a very high valuation. Pass for me I think it'll drop, many IPOs rocket then plummet then rise first day IPO and they already 8\~9 billion market cap. do you guys remember what RKLB market cap during first day IPO?

1mjz4sn,2025-08-07,"People looking at Archer (ACHR) now… what’s your actual thesis?
So Archer Aviation just got a price target bump from JPMorgan from $9 to $10 but they still kept it at neutral. Stock popped a few percent on that, but trading volume was weak

I’ve been watching this one for a while but still not sure if we’re actually at a good entry or just chasing hype

The legal situation is partly cleaned up Delaware court dismissed liability claims against the CEO. That seems like a decent win, though there are still unresolved claims about misrepresentation of valuation & their Midnight aircraft progress

The FAA certification deadline is still 2025 & they’ve got ~$6B in conditional orders from names like United Airlines and the DoD. Big numbers but still conditional & they’re burning cash with a projected $1.32/share loss this year. That said, they’ve got about $1B in liquidity to ride it out

JPMorgan wasn’t the only one weighing in, firms like Needham still have it as a buy at $13.25 average target. Meanwhile, some insiders (CFOs) sold a few million worth, but they still hold sizeable stakes. Institutions like CalSTRS & Private Advisor Group have also increased positions

I guess I’m trying to figure out if this is still a speculative early play on the eVTOL sector or if we’re starting to see a real inflection point with legal risk dropping & institutional interest climbing

Anyone here already holding ACHR or planning to enter? Curious to hear what convinced you either way. Is it about the FAA milestone? The industry tailwinds? Or just betting on Archer specifically vs JOBY & the rest?

They haven’t delivered a product and have zero revenue, so yes I’d say it’s still a speculative play Speculation pump is the only reason I’m in. It's a very speculative play I think realistically geared a bit more towards the defensive side given Anduril partnership. It's the ""official air taxi of the 2028 Olympics"" but I can more easily see defense use in the near future. Yeah bro the Olympics tagline is cute but DoD money hits different. Anduril doesn’t play unless there’s real use case.. Archer’s looking more like a classified contract in the making than a rideshare.

1mjy16h,2025-08-07,"Up 40% on RBLX - but is this just the beginning of Roblox becoming the YouTube of immersive worlds?
I'm currently up about 40% on RBLX. It's one of the best performers in my portfolio this year. That said, I'm starting to wonder if the valuation is getting ahead of itself… or maybe the market is just correctly pricing it as a long-term compounder now that it's clearly moved beyond being “just a kids’ game.” I’ve been thinking through my thesis here, and while I’ve got a few structured ideas, I’m also very open to feedback. Here’s what I’ve got so far:

**1. Platform Monetization Is Just Getting Started**  
Roblox has gone from raw engagement to a more sophisticated monetization engine, and I think that shift is only just beginning. They’re layering infrastructure and incentives (ads, pricing tools, IP licensing) on top of the existing UGC flywheel. We’re seeing early signs: rewarded video ads are scaling via Google, DevEx payouts are up 52% YoY ($316M), and their new Creator Rewards system is moving away from just time-based payouts toward acquisition and engagement, which is arguably a much healthier structure. Bookings per payer are up 6% YoY, and branded experiences (e.g., Netflix, Sega) suggest IP licensing could become a real revenue stream. All of this supports a potential re-rating on P/S and P/FCF as monetization per DAU improves. Main risk here is that ads could cannibalize IAP or alienate users if poorly implemented.

**2. Global Growth Is Real and Underappreciated**  
The international story is sneaky strong. APAC DAUs are up 76%, bookings up 75% YoY. Indonesia alone is +150%, Korea +120%, India +90%, and Japan +50%. They’ve clearly improved infrastructure (e.g., low-latency servers in Singapore) and localization (auto-translation, regional pricing). The flywheel is kicking in globally. If this trend continues, international markets could provide both DAU and bookings upside, reducing reliance on the U.S. That said, monetization in low-ARPU regions is a risk, and regulatory friction (especially in India or Korea) could become a drag.

**3. Roblox Is Building a Developer OS for the Immersive Economy**  
This is maybe the most exciting angle. They’re not just a game platform, they’re quietly building an operating system for immersive content creation. With tools like Cube 3D (for AI-generated 3D models), Roblox Studio, RoGuard for safety, and better discovery AI, the whole dev stack is becoming much more powerful and user-friendly. There are already over 1 million AI-generated 3D assets live, and build cycles are shortening dramatically. Add in the fact that creators can now monetize physical merch, and we’re looking at an emerging ecosystem that could become to immersive games what Shopify is to ecommerce. Of course, risks include UEFN (Epic) and TikTok’s Project Ripple gaining steam, plus the threat of AI commoditizing content and ongoing moderation burdens.

All this is supported by the rate of change in the financials in almost every single metric.

Anyway, that’s where I’m at. Bullish, but keeping my eyes open. Would love to hear counterpoints or other takes.
the lawsuits of all the games they've been blatantly stealing like get to work and peak are gonna be legendary. I too enjoy exploring child labor and copying IP. No, Roblox is the AliExpress of Steam. Atrioc viewer in the wild It’s a massive grey area - the reality is that Roblox is doing nothing to prevent and hold blatantly stolen games accountable. Additionally, they’ll protect these stolen games with tooth and nail before admitting fault or removing the game.

Bad - softening labor market is often a sign of an economic slowdown or recession

Good - economic slowdown will likely force rate cuts in September

Good - the market loves rate cuts

Bad - rate cuts might accelerate inflation again

Bad - tariffs

1mjonq7,2025-08-07,"AAPL: guys who sold looking dumb
AAPL basically dodge the tariffs with Tim Cooks finesse. Cook has been dealing with China for decades. He knows how to negotiate.

Apple just reported 10% revenue growth and 12% profit growth. 

All those anti-trust lawsuits in the US will go away. Tim knows the game.

But the main reason to keep investing in Apple:

Apple has over a BILLION super loyal customers who continue to spend hundreds if not thousands of dollars on Apple products. They are stuck in the Apple ecosystem. The customer retention rate has to be 90-95%. Younger generations love Apple products. 

No other company has this type of brand loyalty at such a massive scale that is willing to spend big dollars. 
Wait until the tariffs start hitting the economic numbers I own a lot of AAPL. The only reason for the boost today was due to the tariff dodge and domestic investments. No one could have expected that lol. Post earnings the stock was pretty much flat. Hard to time today is this pasta?

1mjdr5t,2025-08-06,"Would tomorrow's unemployment data have an impact given how revisions tanked the market and other catalysts that could affect SPY?
I'm assuming since the jobs revisions had an actual affect on the market then unemployment should follow suit given that should correlate with them. Then there's the issue with tariffs, but I would assume he's going to extend again so no point in arguing that. What I am concerned about as well is next week's CPI because that could have an impact on the cuts predicted to come in september. The market is a circus right now, but even then it reacted to harsh data, so would the upcoming data be bad enough to impact it negatively or positively, or flat? Any smarter people that could expand on this and impacts going into next week?
When the numbers are bad market will go up because the fed will lower rates. When the numbers are good market will go up because economy is soaring. It'll be positive, otherwise someone else is going to lose their job. People act like the market never dips. Only a few months ago, Trump tanked the market.


In the start of covid it tanked, and a while in to covid, rates were raised and risky stocks tanked. By making your theory public, you just allowed all the hedge funds' web crawlers to access it and already execute your strategy. All has been priced in now. Sorry, try next time without telling Reddit! Tanked in Covid, then hit its ATH 7 months later, kicking off a bull run that lasted over a year The type of numbers matter though. If we end up in a stagflation then no one wins, and in order for that to happen we need high unemployment and high inflation. Given last months inflation stat and the jobs revisions, it seems we're heading into stagflation. Tomorrows numbers could support that.

1mjbkv0,2025-08-06,"Rebalancing porfolio
Looking at my portfolio this morning and noticed my stocks are now 45% of my total. Used to be ETFs 85% and stocks 15%, but NVDA, PLTR, META, NFLX, MSFT and a few others went and messed it all up. Several finance forums and books mention rebalancing investments regularly, but I mean do people actually sell super strong stocks to convert to ETFs? I mean wouldn't that be a bad move from a return perspective? But I guess the goal is to secure the profits and remove risky positions.

Curious to know what other people do in this situation.
Assuming you’ve got a good cost basis, 45% in those stocks is something I’d be okay with. I’m assuming/hoping that pltr is the smallest portion of those? It’s been doing well, I own it, but it doesn’t have the legacy and too big to fail status of the others. 

Also for reference, etf’s are only apart of my retirement accounts and not my personal self directed account. >but I mean do people actually sell super strong stocks to convert to ETFs? 

No I wouldn't. But IMO it depends how much DD you have done.  If you just followed the herd, but have no idea about the business or its financials, it may be safer to convert some amount to ETF.  It's easy come, and easy go (for a faltering business).

I own all the tickers on your list but PLTR.  I am not selling a single share of any of them any time soon.  With that said, combined they're not anything close to 85% of my portfolio. Well there is no rule but yours. Personally I’m probably 15% ETFs 70% stocks and the rest in cash. I have no problem selling parts of stocks at the highs to lower risk. You certainly picked some terrific stocks pal. LOL..Depending on your comfort level I’d probably trim all the stocks..maybe 5% ..only if it’ll make you more sleep better..I just trimmed PLTR as it became too big a percentage in my portfolio..same with META..just added to NFLX after a trim at 1340…remember there is no correct answer..you are your own portfolio manager..and that’s cool 😎 it is all about right companies as long as business is selling well

Hi everyone, I’m looking to build a portfolio for long-term investing (around 5-10 years). What stocks or sectors do you think are good picks to hold for the long run? Looking forward to your suggestions!

My list right now is Microsoft | Amazon | Alphabet | ASML | Uber | Thermo Fisher | Visa | BYD , Xiaomi | Rolls-Royce | Pepsi | Waste Management

Maybe UNH, Novo
Google. They are keeping up with new trends and are always innovating. With their mass amounts of data, research team and overall dominance, they aren’t gonna fall behind. Also earnings came out while back, which showed they crushed it and always have, AI isn’t replacing them anytime soon. This is correct.  I just Googled it. I'd add RKLB for fun. ASTS Broadcom I think that is a good list. But maybe RDDT deserves a space there as the human layer of AI. The human element is likely to get really scarce as bots and AI take over the world.

- msft

Ai supply chain:
- tsm
- siemens
- (maybe if you don’t feel it’s too big at this point, which i do) nvidia

Big tech:

China big tech:
- bidu
- baba
- jd

Batteries ( a lot of upside here when progress is made for both cars and solar energy storage)
- Amperex
- BYD

CRISPR tech:
- vrtx
- regn
- mrk
- crspr

Add some broad market indexes in case you miss a great developing sector:
- s&p
- nasdaq
- euro stoxx
- msci japan

To protect against aggressive downturns, since we’re at ath and high uncertainty:
- a gold etf
- berkshire
- some bonds maybe

Sell the last group in the first 15-20% downturn and rebalance SOFI I think the selling in NVO has gotten excessive and the stock is technically oversold.

1mja0rz,2025-08-06,"Msft stock and Open AI
Microsoft stock potential for 1/3 OpenAI ?

I rarely listen to fincl pods. Even though I should do it more. I'm quite sure I'm late to this comment.
On Dumb Money pod one of the guys said MSFT may be gifted/buy 1/3rd of Altmans OpenAI.
Is MSFT stock price already priced in this potential?

The pod also discussed Anthropic and how difficult it was for this guy to have opportunity to invest in it.

What are others doing to try to capture OpenAI opportunities?
I have $80k ready to invest above and beyond maxed retirement Accts and funds needed for my lifestyle.
If you’re asking if something you heard on a podcast is priced into the market you should be buying VOO You're thinking about it in the wrong way. 

Yes, OpenAI is planning to have an IPO at half a trillion dollars. Is it worth that much? What about when deepseek 2.0 comes out, will it be worth half a trillion? What about when China produces their 4th or 5th or 10th competitor to OpenAI, will OpenAI still be worth half a trillion? 

LLMs are just a commodity. Right now that perceived value is high, but as commodities go, the price goes up and down and up and down. And there will be other companies that enter into the market to offer real actionable competition, at lower prices. 

And I haven't even talked about whether open AI has monetized their product yet! 

Either way, whether MSFT ends up owning a piece of open AI or not, MSFT is well positioned to produce actual revenue in the coming AI revolution. Buy MSFT at any price with confidence. My problem is I’m worried they’ll get commoditised here. They could win through personalisation like what Spotify did. But Google has more data on you than OpenAI.

As for the question I’m not sure tbh. Maybe others can help with that. Where do others research?

Where do you find your information?  certain pods/financial news sources/youtube folks?

Are there any certain orgs/individuals you listen to (paid or free) for investment advice? 

Since I can't make this a one off post I'll comment here. The average investor already has plenty of AI exposure through google, Amazon, meta, nvidia & Microsoft making up a big chunk of indexes. If you want to pick stocks I would suggest reading Peter Lynch and sticking to domains you already know a lot about. I definitely understand and do hold voo in my retirement accounts and another taxed brokerage acct.
I definitely don't even know what questions to ask.
I'm probably more interested in how can the avg Joe/main Street investor invest in AI directly. The pod made comments that a $250mm fund they had couldn't get in on the funding round for anthropic I think.
That's when they brought up indirectly investing into Open AI and how msft is set to be leader in this.

I am trying to position myself to ride the wave of AI, and while I missed the NVDA boat (in NOV 2023 I thought I was too late, LOL), I have a few positions, but... these are my assumptions:

1. When it comes to innovation, newcomers always eat the incumbents' lunch. As much as  presently it feels like the Magnificents are the ones making all the gains.
2. I am a strong believe in the 80/20 rules, so I am trying to find the companies that constitute the 20% which will lead to 80% of AI gains
3. Let's leave NVDA out, shall we?

So, fellow redditors, which companies do you see constituting the core of the AI echosystem?  I see ASML, TSM, AMD... who else?  Especially smaller payers and not the GOOG & Co.

T.I.A.
The idea that ""when it comes to innovation, newcomers always eat the incumbents' lunch"" is simply untrue: Microsoft has been a great tech stock for the past 39 years after its 1986 IPO.

Some smaller companies in AI to consider are APLD, NBIS, and CRWV although the latter is disliked here > The idea that ""when it comes to innovation, newcomers always eat the incumbents' lunch"" is simply untrue: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma 

Hardard U teaches a class based on that book. Most all of the other quality B-School teach a *Managing Innovation* or similar classes based on that book. If you're interested in Innovation,  I strongly suggest you find an online class on EdX or somewhere and take it.

Thank you for the suggestions, I have a long position on CRWV (I participated on the IPO). > Look into $PLTR, $SMCI, and some lesser-known LLM infrastructure plays real 80/20 potential there.

I have PLTR in my portfolio, and I am happy with it, but I am not sure it is part of that 20%. SMCI? Isn't that the company that is also hording BitCoins? That move turned me off.

1mj84e3,2025-08-06,"Is Qualcomm (QCOM) a buying opportunity?
Qualcomm is a semiconductor company that designs chips for connectivity and wireless connection. Their chips are used in phones, modems, cars, computers, and a wide variety of other things. Right now the worry is that they’re tied to Apple too much and are not diversified enough. 

However looking at the numbers about 25% of their total revenue was tied to Apple in 2022. Now it’s about 15%. Their Automotive and Internet of Things segments are currently experiencing significant double digit growth. It looks like their diversification strategy has been playing out well for them so far. 

As far as market valuation is concerned they currently trade at a 14 P/E ratio with a Forward P/E ratio of around 12. Their EV/EBITDA multiple is around 11 right now. Their financials are extremely healthy as well when you look at the balance sheet. 

Overall in a bull market buying opportunities can be few and far between and right now this looks like an opportunity. The company has solid earnings growth, trades at a low valuation, and their business strategy to diversify seems to be playing out well. 

 What are your guys thoughts around the stock?
I live in San Diego and I know some people who work there. This is a sleeper rocket and the stock is highly manipulated. The level of manipulation is so much that it goes down after beating earnings. One person I met at a bar who works there told me they have major announcements and big deals to be disclosed but I’m too scared to put money into it considering their past 2 years record. I held for almost a year and sold for break-even QCOM looking juicy af at that P/E. Apple dependency fading, auto/IoT heating up. If market stays bullish, this is low-key a sleeper rocket. I don't think it's a bad idea. It has always had a low valuation and I will say that while their automotive segment did have growth last quarter, semis are cyclical and autos are particularly so.

Is it reasonably priced (including vs 5 year average valuation)? Yeah. Could do reasonably well from here if you got a further uptick in these segments, but just know automotive will probably be a real negative when there's a downturn in that segment - see also: NXPI. Absolutely, took a decent position on it today Yeah IoT is next big thing imo. We'll talk to everything and manage everything so everything needs a chip to be controlled. If technology can make our lives easier and buy us some time, it has no cost.

Is anyone questioning dishwasher or washer ? Yes its potential to become the leader in IOT including connected automobiles, VR headsets, on device AI.

1mj5cci,2025-08-06,"Trump, Apple to Announce Fresh $100 Billion US Investment
President Donald Trump will announce that Apple Inc. will commit to spend another $100 billion on domestic manufacturing, the latest pledge by the tech giant to increase US production of its products as it seeks to avoid punishing tariffs on its flagship iPhones.

The announcement at the White House on Wednesday includes a new manufacturing program designed to bring more of Apple’s supply chain to the US, with an eye toward manufacturing additional critical components domestically, according to a White House official who detailed the announcement on the condition of anonymity.

Also, the $10 billion investment from Foxconn he announced back in 2017. What about the $175 billion dollars Golden Dome announced this year?

Yeah. That's what I thought. Didn’t Apple announce they were going to spend billions in the US a few months ago 100% Shhh. Gotta keep Trump thinking he came up with this! Even this one, they stated ""over the next 4 years"".  Trump won't still be in office in 4 years. And in 3.5 years this will disappear This will result in nothing. It takes years to build the necessary plants and they know in 4 years they’ll be able to resume business as usual. Lip service to the orange man so he leaves them alone, which is the smart move here.

1mj56fq,2025-08-06,"McDonald’s sees U.S. sales rebound, but concerns about low-income consumers linger
McDonald’s on Wednesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that topped analysts’ expectations as buzzy promotions helped its U.S. restaurants rebound.

Despite the chain’s improved performance this quarter, executives are still worried about the economic health of the low-income consumer. McDonald’s is working with its U.S. franchisees on ways to make its core menu items more affordable, beyond the $5 meal deal it rolled out last summer and the newer Daily Double burger promotion.

“Reengaging the low-income consumer is critical, as they typically visit our restaurants more frequently than middle- and high-income consumers,” CEO Chris Kempczinski told analysts on the company’s earnings conference call. “This bifurcated consumer base is why we remain cautious about the overall near-term health of the U.S. consumer.”

Executives said they anticipate that McDonald’s results will be stronger in the second half of the year, particularly as the chain faces easier comparisons in the fourth quarter to the fallout from last year’s E. coil outbreak.

Shares of the company rose more than 2% in morning trading.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** $3.19 adjusted vs. $3.15 expected
* **Revenue:** $6.84 billion vs. $6.7 billion expected

The fast-food giant reported second-quarter net income of $2.25 billion, or $3.14 per share, up from $2.02 billion, or $2.80 per share, a year earlier.

Excluding restructuring charges and other items, McDonald’s earned $3.19 per share.

Revenue rose 5% to $6.84 billion. Kempczinski credited the chain’s value, marketing and new menu items for the 6% increase in system sales during the quarter.

Same-store sales, a metric that only tracks the performance of restaurants that have been open at least a year, increased 3.8%, the chain’s biggest jump in nearly two years.

McDonald’s U.S. restaurants saw same-store sales growth of 2.5%, reversing two straight quarters of domestic declines. Kempczinski said the burger chain outperformed its rivals by both same-store sales and comparable traffic.

“Certainly, overall \[quick-service restaurant\] traffic in the U.S. remained challenging, as visits across the industry by low-income consumers once again declined by double digits versus the prior year period,” he said.

This quarter, the burger chain’s U.S. sales received a boost from a tie-in meal with the “Minecraft” movie and the launch of the McCrispy Chicken Strips.

Shortly after the quarter ended, Snack Wraps returned to menus for the first time in nine years; executives said that early results are “encouraging,” and franchisees have voted to maintain the $2.99 promotional price through the end of the year.

Outside the U.S., demand for its Big Macs and french fries was even stronger.

“I would just note, also on our international side, it’s not as competitive a market as it is in the U.S.,” Kempczinski said. “I think it’s a little bit easier for us to stand out and represent good value in international.”

The chain’s international developmental licensed markets division, which includes Japan and China, reported same-store sales growth of 5.6%.

Its international operated markets segment saw same-store sales growth of 4%, thanks to gains in markets like the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada. Executives said McDonald’s value and affordability scores from consumers have improved in key markets.

It boggles my mind how people
eat there often. I ate a really good costco steak last for the same price as mcdonald’s McDonald's has a habit of being in the right place at the right time. The land they have acquired over the years pretty much guarantees them footfall when the average citizen is most likely to be hungry with limited options. Low income earners not being able to afford McDonald’s is sad. Companies like McDonald’s feed off of stupid people let’s be honest here. Just put it on a credit card or split it into 20 different payments with klarna. Free food bro >“This bifurcated consumer base is why we remain cautious about the overall near-term health of the U.S. consumer.”

I mean ... yeah, the fact that ""bifurcated consumer base"" is a phrase pretty clearly shows the economic distress the working class is in right now. Yea so… I’m not coming back… ever unless $1 drink comes back, and some constant non app scam deal to get a couple of cheap sandwiches. I want to be full on $5 and with the quality they serve up I still feel like I’m being generous I live in a small town and I don’t get it. There’s a DQ, a McDonald’s, a pizza place, a Mexican restaurant, and 2 grocery stores. That’s the extent of our food options here aside from driving 20 minutes in to the nearby city. The grocery store is about 2 blocks from our McDonalds and has premade food for like half the price. If you’re hungry, and lazy, just go to the grocery store. It’s actually quicker because you can just walk in, grab the food, self checkout, and leave within a couple minutes.

Somehow, in this tiny ass Hicksville town, there’s always at least 3 cars in line at McDonald’s 1. McD is very app-centric now. So diners can get good deals via app offers and incentives. I work at a company that manages part of the martech stack they use to do this.

2. McD has a distinct flavor and taste and no other place offers it.

3. Real-estate location.

4. Limited time meals with toys/blindboxes, we're in a very gambling focused era.

1mj54g2,2025-08-06,"Uber beats on revenue, announces $20 billion stock buyback
Uber reported second-quarter results on Wednesday that beat on revenue and announced the authorization of a $20 billion stock buyback.

Here’s how the company did versus analysts’ estimates compiled by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 63 cents vs. 63 cents expected.
* **Revenue:** $12.65 billion vs. $12.46 billion expected.

Here are the key segment numbers:

* **Mobility (gross bookings):** $23.76 billion, up 18% year over year
* **Delivery (gross bookings):** $21.73 billion, up 20% year over year

Uber’s revenue increased 18% from $10.7 billion a year earlier. For the quarter ending June 30, net income rose to $1.36 billion, or 63 cents per share, from $1.02 billion, or 47 cents per share, a year ago.

Gross bookings rose 17% to $46.8 billion, and the company reported adjusted earnings of $2.12 billion.

“At this point, we’re not seeing weakness in the consumer,” CEO Dara Khosrowshahi told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” Wednesday. “It’s steady as she goes, and for Uber, that’s great news.”

Uber’s “monthly active platform consumers” increased 15% to 180 million in the second quarter. The company said users booked around 3.3 billion trips during the period, up 18% from a year earlier.

Normal things innocent people do After Apple inexplicably pumps 5% in the morning, the white house publicly says they won't be impacted by India tariffs? 

Life must be so easy as a US politician Stocks saved by a company promising to spend a massive sum over an indeterminate period of time. Everyone who thinks these tariffs are bearish for stocks dont understand what he's really doing here. 

This is gonna be a huge boost to wallstreet when the dust settles, and main street will get boned. All the top companies will file in, kiss the ring, promise some obscure amount invested in America, and land tariff exemptions. 

This will undercut the small and medium players who cant buy an exemption. Sales will increasingly be driven into the largest cap companies, pushing stocks higher and destroying small businesses

It's morally reprehensible, but you arent going to save main street America by wasting money on puts Shitty earnings for AI stocks AMD and SMCI? BULLISH FOR INDICES

1midhy1,2025-08-05,"Oracle's prime time
Oracle is the winner of all the LLM/AI bs. They are the middle man between the customer and developers (specifically: Google, anthropic, Amazon, xAI, and Meta). This is not an exaggeration---they literally profit off all of them. They are synthesizing it all for their customers, especially The Land of the Free™️. It's not just about making a giant melting pot, but they tailor it to the systems of the customers to interact seamlessly, with no lapse in operations. They've stuck themselves at the neck of the hourglass. If there's one thing you should know about economics, it's that that's where the real money is (think Nestlé). The concept is taking production market and the consumer market and the money flows through an hourglass shaped path. The money makes become so successful because they control that focal point, the bottle neck. They are the ""rent capturing elite"". Not only that, but the earnings are greatly underestimated. Delivery of their projects are ahead of schedule. The Stargate Team (colab of Sam Altman Chatgpt and Oracle) is a generational money opportunity.

Soft Bank in particular os betting big on oracle. The owner is a Japanese investor, and he's 117th richest billionaire. He's banking on this putting him in double digital place. 

They have earnings report in early September and the stock is on discount. 
It’s up 51% YTD and 99% on a rolling 12 months

What discount? Aren’t people using them because capacity is strained at the big 3 hyperscalers. If that growth slows they’ll be the first one to get cut? 

If anyone wants to correct me on this feel free to. >They are the middle man between the customer and developers (specifically: Google, anthropic, Amazon, xAI, and Meta). This is not an exaggeration---they literally profit off all of them.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

1mi465p,2025-08-05,"Is AAPL still a buy?
Compared to other companies such as Meta, Microsoft, or Google, it doesn’t seem like Apple’s stock growth has been that great lately. 

Now, it is widely known that Apple can afford to be slower to the AI game since people will use their devices regardless. But, it still seems like they are doing it very very slowly and not giving it as much urgency as other Big Tech companies. 

Nvidia and Microsoft recently overtook Apple as the world’s largest companies by market cap. 

Where does this go next, and will Apple slowly become smaller than even more companies, and will they collapse in the next 50 years or so?
Look less at AI and more on what future products can bring to the table. Will a foldable iPhone lead to significant growth? Will their services continue to expand? Can they innovate in their wearables department? Then make a decision. I’d argue that Apple is showing their forward thinking by not rushing headlong into the AI bubble, as we have begun to hear stories of companies who have rushed into AI seeing negative consequences.

Being first isn’t always best. Apple’s ability to navigate bubbles has always been why they are the gold standard of tech stocks. Are you kidding? If they are investing in AI, that means they get to say “AI” on all their earnings calls which is worth at least a 10% jump each quarter. i'm still confused what people think AI will ever do for Apple's earnings, even if they were amazing at it. it isn't going to move device sales. it certainly isn't for Google.

they're a consumer product company. they aren't selling gpus or data centers or an ad platform. yeah, they should have a better voice assistant by now, but it doesn't seem to matter to their earnings in a meaningful way. This will be an interesting read. Inverse reddit. 

Probably will never collapse with their insane market share and still good tech which people still love. I have a ton of apple devices at home: iPhones, iPads, HomePods, MacBooks, Apple TV, AirPods, watches etc.

But I don’t plan to replace any of them any time soon. I’m thinking of getting rid of my Apple Watch because it’s not very useful. I replace iPhones every 5 years or so, no reason to do it more often. I haven’t seen anything exciting in the last few years.

And now with different courts forcing Apple to allow other payment methods, their revenue from services will not grow as fast anymore.

I don’t see much growth for Apple. They don’t produce enterprise software, so I think new Siri and other AI features will not draw a lot of new revenue. Gaming on Macs can gain some traction but I don’t think it’ll be significant. Vision Pro is a bust. What else is there? Apple plays the long game. They weren't first with smartphones or tablets either, but dominated when they entered. Their cash reserves are massive and customer loyalty is unmatched. I wouldn't bet against them just because they're not rushing AI features. When they do release something, it'll probably work better than competitors' first attempts. Apple has leveraged a 2nd mover advantage many times. AirPods dominates the headphone market, after buying beats no less lol. Their smart watch owns the whole watch business. Apple TV and Apple Music still growing. Don’t discount Apple just yet. I honestly think Apple sitting out the AI investment race and just licensing mature software when it’s ready is a great move with how behind they are. 


Problem is you’d expect the difference in capital to go to R&D for other technology and it seems like that’s not the case for them. They’re a fine company but their PE is high for how little they’re trying to grow.

1mhsdl6,2025-08-04,"Snap DD for Earnings
Snap will beat earnings. 

Google and Meta have traditionally captured share and posted 10+% and 20+% growth consistently.

This often came at the expense of other players but I think the display ad market has grown quite a bit this year.

Even MSFT's advertising grew 20% plus compare to ~10% for the same quarter last year. Roku and TTD posted ~20% gain as well. 

Unless the folks at SNAP are completely lacking in their GTM strategy, I think there will be a surprise when it comes to advertising earnings. 

Position: ~$600 bet on Aug 8, 10.5 calls; meagre, I know but disclosure is important 
I've bought shares but they have deep problems at snap . Theyre unprofitable.

Last q net loss was 140k  but they had a 257k 'sale and purchase of stock ' expense which if they haven't done something similar will see them in the green .

If they can make a net profit Q2 with good guidance then we may see a significant bump . [deleted] Great prediction 🤣

SNAP has been a garbage company for so long now. You deserve to lose money on this for not understanding the vast difference between the companies you’re comparing lmfaoo

They haven’t been able to hold down a legit advertiser literally ever. Lolol glad you’re not too worried about it. Better luck next gamble Predicting revenue wrecks estimates and comes in the 1.5+ range.  Not much growth this quarter but guidance should be up for next quarter.  Hoping they don't have lower US numbers though. gaap unprofitability is isn’t the issue, no one cares about that. they are fcf positive and have positive opex cash flows which is more important. everyone backs out sbc anyways which is why they’re in the “red” but not really

1mhic22,2025-08-04,"The PermaBulls have been right all along, and perhaps my brain is the smoothest of them all.
I have been firmly in the bear camp for 1/2 decade.

My post history will outline many of the reasons why, but I think I've finally had to come to accept that this market will never see the likes of a massive, dot com, global financial crisis style correction ever again.

A global pandemic that shut the world down couldn't do it (SPY found a new high within 6 months).

Global conflict cannot do it -- the world is as to nuclear war as it's been since the collapse of the USSR.

Ridiculous valuations cannot do it -- The SPY is trading at a P/E that was only higher during dot com, GFC, and for one quarter after COVID hit -- at any point in the last 125+ years.

Bank failures cannot do it -- The failures of signature bank, silicon valley bank, and first republic banks, by assets under management, were larger than all the bank failures combined of the +/- 450 banks that failed in 08.

Rising delinquency rates in auto loans and credit card debt, paired with the highest balances on consumer debt in history have no effect.

A failing commercial real estate sector has no impact.

High interest rates, paired with an unaffordability crisis in the housing sector, means that a majority of Americans can no longer afford to buy a home... irrelevant.

Global trade wars that tank the market 20% only have the ability to hold that price action for 4 months before the market finds new highs.

No my friends -- I think the time has finally come for me to eat my words. To throw caution out the window. To say f\*ck the news, TA, historical precedence, or any individual smell test.

1mhbufy,2025-08-04,"Basically for ACHR to run, everything has to line up
As someone who’s been holding ACHR through the ups and downs, this week’s 14% drop didn’t shake me. Sentiment across eVTOLs is clearly cooling off after the hype wave earlier this year & Archer’s still pre revenue, which means every move is amplified. No news from the company, just light volume & some options hedging

JPMorgan raised their price target from $9 to $10 but still kept a Neutral rating. They flagged cash burn and delays in revenue as key risks (nothing new) & called the recent market behavior *irrational exuberance.* Not wrong, but a PT bump is still a bullish tell

They also don’t expect Trump’s executive order *(which explicitly supports advanced air mobility)* to impact earnings soon but let’s be real, that kind of policy shift helps the long term narrative.

Technicals are a mixed bag right now. MACD shows a buy, but 20 day and 50 day EMAs are still above the current price, so short term traders are treating this like a downtrend. Doesn’t change my thesis.

The stock is still trading with speculative energy, but that’s how early-stage bets work. Analysts are still leaning bullish with a “Moderate Buy” consensus & a $11.92 PT *(almost 24% upside from here).*

For ACHR to rerate higher, they’ll need to deliver clean earnings, show progress on certification milestones, and eventually break into revenue territory. Until then, volatility is just part of the package.

If you’re in from $12+, sure, that hurts. But sub $10 is a zone I’ll keep nibbling. Not saying it moons tomorrow, but I’d rather build a position now than chase it later on a surprise catalyst
Just out of curiosity, how do you explain Joby's rise over the last month? JOBY has been and will continue to be ahead of Archer. [deleted] Further ahead in FAA certification, which has improved investor confidence. Joby is doing well This run up feels like a setup. Big boys will sell into the hype and retail gets left holding the empty rotor blades You’re not wrong. Market’s treating Joby like it’s Amazon Prime Air and not a prototype shop with a gov contract and a crash on its record. I like this post a lot. I’ve been watching it as well. How long before you think they will turn a profit? This is one of those moments where fundamentals didn’t change, but sentiment did. JPM’s comments were mixed, sure, but they also confirmed gov support, cash runway, and a credible timeline. If people wanna sell me $ACHR under $9.50 again, I’m here.

1mh92z4,2025-08-04,"Analyst bullish on Palantir stock before earnings
Wedbush reiterated an outperform rating and a price target of $160 for Palantir stock ahead of its earnings, according to a recent research note.

Analysts led by Daniel Ives said the recent deal with the U.S. Army represents an additional tailwind, which places Palantir in the sweet spot to benefit from ""a tidal wave of federal spending on AI.""

""We continue to believe that Palantir’s unique AI software approach will be a positive growth catalyst as governments look to further increase efficiency with more software/lower headcount,"" Ives wrote.

1mgm7st,2025-08-03,"Atlassian (TEAM) Rovo + Vertical Ecosystem Be Its Moment?
I’m thinking about whether Atlassian’s AI-powered Rovo, tied to its vertically integrated ecosystem, could spark an “iPod moment” like Apple’s in 2003. Back then, Apple was a niche PC player, and the iPod + iTunes ecosystem made them a consumer titan. Atlassian’s in a similar spot strong with its interconnected suite (Jira, Confluence, Trello, Bitbucket) used by 83% of Fortune 500, but middle-tier against Microsoft, ServiceNow, and GitLab.


Rovo’s an AI platform baked into Atlassian’s tightly knit ecosystem, connecting Jira (dev), Confluence (docs), Trello (tasks), and Bitbucket (code) with third-party tools like Slack and Google Drive. Its unified search pulls contextual data across these tools, Rovo Chat answers queries with company-specific insights, and Rovo Agents automate tasks like backlog cleanup or code reviews. It’s powered by the Teamwork Graph (20+ years of workflow data) and free for Premium/Enterprise users.


Could Rovo’s integration with Atlassian’s vertical system where tools share data and workflows seamlessly be a game changer? It tackles pain points of work time spent searching. Rovo’s no-code agents let teams customize workflows, keeping them in Atlassian’s orbit, much like iTunes locked users into Apple’s ecosystem.


Microsoft’s Copilot and ServiceNow’s AI are tough competitors with bigger ecosystems. And B2B sales cycles are slower than the iPod’s consumer boom. Atlassian’s open integrations, unlike Apple’s walled garden, might limit lock-in. What do you think? Can Rovo make Atlassian the enterprise AI leader, or is it just another feature?

Very few organizations use Atlassian's whole stack. You might have Jira, maybe with Confluence, but rarely are you also on Bitbucket and Trello in the way you're proposing here.

There's significant overlap and some of their tools aren't seen as on par with the best in class or especially good for fringe cases. I'm sure it's nice to say you'll search git commit notes, but that's not something most people want to do.

So it could be a handy tool that people use if they want to search Confluence. Yes, that could make Confluence a better bet against some of the other options there.

But is it a great multiplier where companies will buy the whole stack to have unified search. Probably not. Their pricing isn't very friendly to that approach and most of the other tools in this space are working on similar search and query solutions. How are they still unprofitable and wtf is with that share dilution? Needs new management View it as a double edge.

1mgek5n,2025-08-03,"If recession is certain, would one divest away from VGT into few individual stocks?
I got about a million dollars in VGT and I’m starting to get worried about looming recession. 

Would it be smart for me to move away from it into few stocks that I believe will perform well in face of economic slowdown over the next 3-5 years, such as GOOG, MSFT, and NVDA?

Much appreciated. 
VGT is basically 50% NVDA, MSFT and AAPL so the majority of returns will be dependent on these three stocks. Selling it and then switching to the same stocks it's kinda pointless. Recession is not certain tf? In this economy I'm pretty sure Trump will fake everything and pump the economy for now, and itll crash after hes gone Guy has a million dollars and is asking poor kids on Reddit for advice? You’re cooked dude. Get a financial advisor. People need to decide for themselves. Either we will have a booming AI economy that could remove some jobs, but will cause GDP to grow, or we will have a recession and AI was temporary overhyped. You cant have both. Pretty sure some sort of agency whether it’s moodys or another one came out and said the probability is 49%. The head of that agency said he’s almost entirely confident recession will happen. Recession indicators are all flashing. Jerome Powell said the data coming out from the bureau of statistics can’t be fully trusted since they fired so many people and they have to estimate up to a half up from 10%. It’s not looking good at all right now. Trumps flip flops in international policy gets us less business and he probably will continue his bs. That job report not counting Covid was the worst one we had since the Great Depression… Yeah, OP is going to learn a tough lesson. Sell diversification and concentrate on a the most hyped up companies in the world all in the same sector (tech, AI). No matter what happens sooner or later OP will lose big time. You know? When people are worried that that being a millionaire isn’t good enough- we might be at the top of a bubble and in need of the great reset. 

You might be right. I’d invest in salt, antibiotics, multi vitamins, water filters, and ammo  Recession is not certain and you’re a millionaire. Chill bro  lol but to the other comment’s point. Trump still won’t say/allow us to have a recession till he’s gone and it’s not his fault. No one knows.

It COULD be a recession, highly likely, or it could be booming.

If your mind is set on recession, just pull out if you're green, sit on cash, and if it does boom, you're missing out on some money, but you can always re-enter.

1mg3amk,2025-08-02,"Wash Sale Confusion
Hi all, I'm seriously confused about the 30 days prior part, regarding the wash sale rule. I see a lot of stuff like this, when I google, or use AI: 

*Adhere strictly to the 30-day rule
Do not repurchase the same security or any ""substantially identical"" security within the 61-day wash sale window. This period includes 30 days before the sale, the day of the sale, and 30 days after the sale.
The safest approach is to avoid repurchasing the exact same stock or security within this window.*

but how the heck do you ""repurchase"" something in the past? The *30 days after* part makes perfect sense to me, just not the 30 days before part. From what I understand, it doesn't matter if I bought shares a year ago, or yesterday--it's still going to trigger a wash sale, if I sell those shares at a loss today, and buy back within the next 30 days...correct? Any clarity appreciated!
i disagree. it stops people from creating fake losses to save on taxes. You’re overthinking this. The vast majority of the time **wash sales don’t matter**.  All it means is there is an indicator on a lot that the cost basis is artificially inflated due to a now disallowed loss for tax purposes.  That’s it. 

If you’re trying to balance your gains and losses at the end of the year, then do that. Don’t worry about having to stay uninvested simply because you sold at a loss and the stock continued to decrease and now you want to buy back in. Don’t let your fear of them effect your trading decisions. 

The only time you might want to take notice is if you sold in December and bought back in during January and you need to manually adjust losses for when you file taxes. Outside of that, it doesn’t matter in the slightest.  I mean, hell, I have a wash sale on a *dividend*… The rule is prohibiting you from performing a wash sale *prophylactically*.  You can’t lock in losses by selling IBM on December 1 and then buying it back on December 2. Nor can you lock in those same losses by buying IBM on November 30 using money from, say, a 1-day loan, and taking the loss the next day. i wish someone explained it to me like this when i was learning This may have already been said but this whole issue really goes back to people selling stocks at the end of the year to harvest capital losses they would use toward their taxes and then buy the same stock back in January. So basically the Wash Sale Rule is there to prevent that or similar paper losses. But as others have said you shouldn’t make trading decisions solely on some concern to avoid the rule applying to your trades. Don’t avoid buying or selling if you think that’s the right thing to do. I wouldn't worry about it too much. The 30 days prior is to just prevent people from purchasing first and then try to claim a loss. It only disallows getting the loss for that year, but that loss will still attach to your remaining lots (delaying the loss pretty much) gotcha, I ran a couple scenarios through AI and I think I have a bit better understanding. Interestingly it sounds like you have to track it share by share--not as I previously thought, where you would just spread the loss evenly across all newly acquired shares. Anyway, I don't typically layer, so I either sell all or none--so I think the ""before"" 30 days case won't apply to me. I think :) I think I understand now, the *30 days before* part is referring to if you buy a 2nd lot (or odd lot)--so you're holding 2 of the same lot for a few days--then you sell the original lot at a loss. That sound right? Say I have 100 shares of company X. It drops 30% and I decide to buy more but want to wait a bit. Then 2 weeks later, I sell the lot I first purchased to get losses of the 30% realized. Then I buy in 2 weeks because it drops another 10%. Except I can't realize those losses and my cost basis for the 2nd purchase lot gets readjusted.

1mfwl0i,2025-08-02,"GOOGL question?
Y’all,
Google is under investigation from DOJ or EU I think. Not sure if they are still ongoing or what not. If so, does anyone know when they conclude the investigation? I just want to know if they are still being investigated or they already got slapped with fine or penalty. OR, the expected outcome or estimated conclusion by when? I am interested in buying but I would like to know these timelines before getting my feet wet. Thanks!
Could be years, could never come to fruition, could be put to bed by trump  TLDR, the Court has ruled that Google is a monopoly on search in Aug 2024. What we’re waiting for now is not the ruling but the remedies. Currently  there are some proposals like selling Chrome, banning Google from paying Apple for being the default search engine,… Remedy is supposed to be finalized by Aug 2025.
There is another anti-trust trial going on about Ad business though, but it has not been ruled I believe The ""remedy"" is competition in the form of ChatGPT lol. This case is total bullshit. Google succeeded because they had the best product, there is nothing wrong with that Google is being weighed down by antitrust and perception AI is a threat to their search business. They will eventually bounce back. The ones kind of in trouble now are Amazon, Apple, Tesla. Amazon is losing AWS share, Apple hasn’t grown in 3 years, and Tesla’s sales are falling. The ruling for the anti-trust remedies is expected soon (I think this month). A full break-up is extremely unlikely however Google will likely be banned from paying Apple and other phone manufacturers a fee for making Google Search the default option. This will likely mean some Apple users (a very small portion) choosing a different Search Engine however overall most Apple users (including myself) will keep Google as the default Search option. Overall the impact to Alphabet's profitability should be fairly negligible because Alphabet will no longer pay an estimated $20 billion a year to Apple for being the default Search option and this saving will also likely be more than the loss of revenue due to some Apple users selecting a different Search Engine. The loser in this anti-trust case really appears to be Apple for losing $20 billion payment every year which is basically pure profit. No one cares about TSLA last time I checked lol The “remedy” is bribe trump obviously I do not think AMZN is in trouble. Yes but the deal is with DOJ from the US.

Lithium price & Stocks are in a bottom of the cycle. Sure the cycle bottom could take another 1-3 years and i think the 2022 peaks will never be seen again there is room for better conditions ahead. There will be a time where new mines are actually being built and the related micro caps will thrive.

1mfs0p4,2025-08-02,"Berkshire Hathaway operating earnings dip 4% as conglomerate braces for tariff impact

Berkshire Hathaway reported an operating profit of $11.16 billion for the second quarter, down 4% from the same period last year. The drop was largely due to weaker results in its insurance underwriting business. Despite that, other segments including railroads, energy, manufacturing, services, and retail posted higher profits compared to a year ago


EPS down 36% Year Over Year,
Revenue down 1% Year Over Year,
EPS down 23% Quarter Over Quarter,
Revenue up 3% Quarter Over Quarter,


I think Berkshire will probably struggle a little during this post-Buffett transition (down 13% since the Buffett's retirement announcement), but the business is in good shape for the future. This is my punishment for buying a profitable company They’re down since Buffett is retiring rather than the business itself struggling. Investors want Abel to prove himself as CEO. I know, I can't believe I overlooked value opportunities like Palantir and Carvana One of the few companies calling it like it is (i.e, they aren't bullshitting the tariff impact talking points out of fear). Abel needs to be Abel to a degree. Sort of like Tim Cook. He’s not going to be Buffett. Nor should he try to be. I see it as an opportunity for Berkshire.  It's a boomer stock and that's why I like it. Boomers don't panic sell.

This and Waste Management are my favorites. No because you overpaid down > Baby Berk (BRKB) has a p/e of 13.

I read a news feed today that stated our energy bills will increase moving forward ""due to increased energy demands due to AI"". In other words, we are helping Meta Msft Goog & Amzn pay their bills. This country is hilarious. Those companies have enough money to pay their own bills. Rich people keep making laws that make them richer and it's just scary that we can't do a single thing about it. As a naturalized citizen from another country, where you think corruption doesn't exist in the USA, then you're here and it's just a whole other flavor of corruption, instead of outright killing. It makes sense that we will be green all August, because the upcoming August jobs report will be at least 1+ million new jobs  Would Trump really hire anyone not willing to lie? So we’re gonna pretend like everything is fine and new market high tomorrow? INDIA WILL BUY RUSSIAN OIL DESPITE TRUMP’S THREATS, OFFICIALS SAY He's the best candidate since Trump found out his original number one pick, Hannibal Lecter, is dead Half of those ads gotta be startup AI companies cause I swear thats all I be seeing I've been looking at it coupled with the really bad GDP growth from Q1 (-0.5).  The Q1 numbers were terrible in large part because of higher than normal imports caused by front running the tariffs. The Q2 is probably extra high because the lack of imports. 

Average the two out and you get a pretty anemic economy, about 1.25% growth annualized out. Some of the soft indicators are pretty bad too. Vegas has seen tourism drop (though s good chunk of that is explained by the precipitous drop in Canadian tourism) and the freight recession easing into a freight depression. We lost a few more trucking companies last week. 

I think this gives JPow ammo to cut because for the first time we've acknowledged a weak labor market and half of the dual mandate kicks in. The consensus now is for a September cut.

1mfk16k,2025-08-02,"Microsoft finally revealed Azures true revenue. What do we all think?
Microsoft used to bundle all kinds of other devices like O365, server licenses, etc. into their “Intelligent Cloud” segment, muddying comparisons with AWS and GCP. Looks like this time, they finally caved and reported numbers. The growth always looked sus to me in the real world given everyone anecdotally swears by AWS and I know very few who use Azures compute or data infrastructures. 

Azure made $75B in the year, apparently growing 34% YoY. GCP is at $50B and AWS is at $111B. AWS has a sizable 32% lead over Microsoft here. 

AWS is also growing 18% and accelerating. But if we assume it stays at say 20% and Azure stays at 35%, it’s catching up by 15% a year. Applying simple compounding, this means Azure will take 3-4 years to reach parity with AWS around the $200B mark. 

Satya is super strategic. Why would he reveal Azure numbers now? Many analysts think it’s because Azure only recently showed that it has a shot of catching AWS due to OpenAI demand. Microsoft is paying openAI which is then paying Microsoft back for using azure compute. 

The future of cloud dominance is all going to come down to openAI carrying Azure growth vs the strength of their combined competitors like Anthropic, llama, Gemini, etc. Anthropic already has better models for some use cases. GPT is also not exclusive to Microsoft and already available on GCP. 

This is not even getting into profitability. We don’t know if Azure is profitable with the AI workloads. Microsoft hasn’t reported those numbers yet. But we do know AWS is printing money and has been even before AI. 

This is going to be an interesting 3 years. I think AI models are increasingly reaching parity. So if there’s no competitive advantage between them, I fully expect AWS to retain and even expand their lead as they simply offer a better product, prices, experience and support. 

 
I wouldn't over-index on OpenAI carrying Azure. Sure it is compute-intensive, but it will be a drop in the ocean vs all the other companies renting their servers, databases and services.

Microsoft is in almost every single organisation in some form or another. That will be a LOT more spend than OpenAI alone. MS is very strong outside of the US. Here in Poland it’s almost as if cloud means Azure. Sure there are alternatives, yes AWS is trying to make a foothold, yes Google is paying handsomely for carving out some space, then there are many European and local competitors that also make a living. But you can’t easily defy the great head start that MS had in Europe. So while AWS is king in US, MS rules everywhere else. I'm surprised that GCP is that close to Azure. Buy more MSFT. I mean, that’s just your anecdote. I’m a cloud engineer working at a consulting company and we have lots of massive customers with millions of spend per year in azure doing very interesting stuff. Yeah. One website using 2-3 services. Try thousands of applications currently using every possible service. 

A small shop or a shop that committed to containers can treat cloud as commodity. 

A big enterprise that went all in with a cloud provider 8-10 years ago is a lot harder to unwind. Your simple compounding is too simple. The revenue gap between them is $35B now.  If they have the same growth rates next year, Microsoft will reduce that gap by $5B. That difference will not been achieved in four years. Cloud is ultimately a commodity. Personally, I’m bullish on Jassey nodding at potentially diverting attention to other parts of Amazon’s business and exploring other verticals.

1mfeif2,2025-08-02,"Comparing ETFs and long term growth funds
I’m trying to get a general idea of the long term growth ETFs and index funds people are talking about.

What percent of your total stock portfolio would you invest in it?

How do I choose between VOO, VGT, SPY or SCHG?
Diversification. VT contains every public company in the world, weighted by market cap. It automatically adjusts as various companies/industries/countries grow and shrink. It's a set and forget long term hold. 100% VT here SCHG. Slightly more aggressive than VOO and less aggressive than the tech-focused funds. Good balance. Anyone giving you answers based on this post alone is doing you a disservice. 

Age, time horizon, immediate / long term investment goals, risk tolerance ect are all important to note. Specifically the first two. I have a huge amount of VTI.  I went with that over VT.  VTI is probably 20 percent of my account.  It’s overweighted for sure.  From there I have other sectors like emerging markets, tilted small and med caps. Then just individual dividend paying stocks. Why did you choose it over the other options? VTI is at the core of my 4 fund portfolio and is 40% of the total. It's hard to argue with, it's time tested and well diversified. Thousand percent. Out performs it all. I almost want to just get VT and call it a day.  But I already have the black rock emerging and developing market ETFs that cover that.  Every big dip day I buy 5 shares of VTI. Ah, so it’s even more set and forget than the others.

1mez7fx,2025-08-01,"Is hiring someone to invest your money the best hands-off approach?
I know I want to invest, and I want to start investing early. I've heard a little bit about what you should invest in but quite frankly it all goes in one ear and out the other because I'm not personally that interested in learning more and it bores me. Should I look into a professional and trust them with my money? Is there one specific thing that I can invest in? 

I'd prefer safety, I'm working a full time and a part time job and have a good bit of savings that I'm willing to invest. I'm thinking maybe a 60% safe investments, 10% risky and the rest in savings? 

PS. I know reddit probably isn't where you should be trusting your money, but Google doesn't give you one solid answer, nor can I ask questions if I have them so that's why I'm asking here.
why pay someone when you can easily do it yourself for free - put that money in VOO and watch it grow Just put it all into a basic boring ETF like VT and be done with it.  You should never have someone else managing your money. Statistically, financial advisors do not beat the S&P. Pick VTI and/or VOO, and just invest yourself. DCA every two weeks and move on.

1mey6ge,2025-08-01,"AMD is evolving from a chip supplier to a full-fledged AI computing platform player
The MI350 is close enough to Nvidia's performance that AMD can finally charge something closer to a premium price. This chip is no longer just an affordable alternative - it's being used in real-world, mission-critical AI workloads. Most importantly, this is the “early inflection point” in the changing competitive landscape you've been watching.



Revenue and margin gains are real 

At higher average selling prices, AMD has been able to grow significantly without having to dramatically increase volume. Even the relatively low volume of the MI350 ($25K) is likely to boost Q3 and Q4 results, especially considering that they will be compared to a period when China's exports were hit hard. Margins could also improve: shifting more of the GPU portfolio to higher-end SKUs will help close AMD's earnings gap with Nvidia and Broadcom - which still limits AMD's P/E ratio.



The market expects AMD's GPU revenue to be around $1.65 billion in the third quarter. If MI355X grows as expected in the second half of the year and prices move in line with expectations, AMD's revenue could be revised upward.



Major customers could be behind this move 

AMD wouldn't be pressing prices so aggressively unless major cloud service providers such as Meta ( META ) and Oracle ( ORCL ) were on board. There is growing evidence that these customers are no longer just interested in AMD's GPUs, but are actually actively deploying them. We saw early signs of this in our Q1 earnings call and earnings filings. Customers appear to be buying AMD's complete AI platform, including ROCm, system integration and long-term support.



AMD vs. Nvidia: The Price Gap is Narrowing 

Even at $25K, the MI350 is less expensive than Nvidia's B200, making AMD an attractive choice for workloads such as inference, especially among enterprises and second-tier cloud service providers that can't justify Nvidia's pricing. This creates an optimal balance of “value and performance,” and AMD is helping to lead the way in certain market segments. This marks a significant shift in the competitive landscape.



Risks remain, but the narrative is changing 

Headwinds remain. China's export restrictions could result in a revenue reduction of \~$800 million in the second half of 2025, and it is unclear if or when licenses will resume. mi355x needs to be released smoothly and continue the momentum of mi350 - any issues with the software or system will be closely watched. rocm is still lagging behind CUDA in developer adoption. Still lagging behind CUDA in terms of adoption, but improving: ROCm now offers day one support for LLaMA 4 and there are over 2 million models optimized for AMD GPUs on Hugging Face.



Overall 

This indicates a shift in AMD's strategy. It supports our broader view that the company is no longer confined to the role of low-cost alternative, but is moving towards leadership in AI computing. If these pricing trends continue - and especially if they trigger even a modest “ahead-of-the-curve” cycle - the market may begin to reassess AMD as less of a traditional chipmaker and more of a AMD as less of a traditional chipmaker and more of a platform company. As these fundamentals strengthen, the technological breakthroughs we've seen from AMD, especially relative to NVIDIA, could begin to gain real staying power.
As an AMD shareholder, all of these AMD pump postings lately are making me nervous. Bro should i buy or not i have 2 dollars  At this point a bot should delete these amd posts if they don't include explanation for how amd deals with cuda. No amd bull answers that or even understands the question, makes me think they are dumb money don’t risk it AMD has ROCm which is their open source platform AMD’s financials on Tuesday are irrelevant. OP just said AMD is set to report $1.65B in quarterly GPU revenue. Nvidia is doing $1.65B in GPU sales every 3 days. What the market wants to know is AMD’s GPU guidance. In their last earnings call, Lisa Su said they do “tens of billions in the coming years” but wouldn’t guide for this year. If she can give strong guidance for 2H 2026 and/or 2027 then we are off to the races. Just sold 35% of my holdings today. Might regret it but made 60% pretty fast... Same. Probably time to sell lol

GLP-1 medications have nothing to do with gene therapy. Uhh... Yeah, for the first few years, until the knock on effects of not having to deal with the co morbidities of diabetes, heart disease, and cancers associated with morbid obesity kick in. 

If everyone who wanted GLP1 could get GLP1 health insurance would become even more obscenely profitable than it is.  

The minute a generic is available, the insurance industry rocket is blowing through the moon and headed for Alpha Centauri. When you consider how much money is spent treating illnesses that arise nearly entirely due to weight and diet, this would save **magnitudes** more than it costs.

Lazy people who can’t stop eating are why healthcare is so expensive. This shouldn’t just be included, it should be mandatory for coverage. I'm not so sure about that. This will add onto the utilization rate that was already very high. That's what caused those stocks to plummet in the first place This will defs help the healthcare insurers… I’d imagine this would roll out and they will produce bio similar drugs to use instead of dispensing Ozempic.

China’s state media just publicly questioned Nvidia’s chip security, asking them to provide clear proof that their AI chips  specifically the H20  don’t have backdoors or privacy risks. They even published a piece titled “Nvidia, how can I trust you?” which feels pretty direct

This comes not long after the U.S. relaxed export rules, allowing Nvidia to sell these chips to China again. Now, with Chinese regulators stepping in and summoning Nvidia for answers, it looks like Beijing might start adding its own layers of scrutiny

It’s hard to tell if this is mostly political signaling or if it could actually lead to more restrictions or a hit to Nvidia’s sales in China. Either way, it adds more uncertainty around one of Nvidia’s biggest overseas markets

The stock was down at the close of trading yesterday. Could NVDA have been affected?
What would this ”backdoor” do exactly? These things are run offline. Will the chips draw Uncle Sam faces into the weights? US wrote a hit piece on Huawei and ""kidnapped"" their CFO in Canada for 4 years.  Huawei is still going strong. 

The real hit on Nvdia is not this.  But maybe a few years down the road when China has a chip design company that will rival Nvdia on this front.

A company that I know received 1 billion in azure credits in exchange of shares in the company. Are these counted in the 33% growth that msft pays? Wouldn't it be wrong?

[deleted] Microsoft has a huge leverage due to existing windows installations.

 For companies which want to move to the cloud and are almost entirely Windows and office based applications, azure is the easiest/laziest choice.

AWS is also essential but with Microsoft, you get basically everything you need in one place. Like literally everything that you need for your large or small business. From the perspective of administration then Microsoft will always win, aws sells it self as the dev friendly option, gcp is for hipsters, and azure is the IT guys choice. Sure but it’s extremely integrated with the most prolific enterprise business stack that has ever existed. Those are growth percents I don’t mean to say either is a bad business or not growing.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

You know the solution to poor job creation and a weakening consumer wallet?

June revised down by 133,000, from +147,000 to +14,000 Trump may destroy the economy but we're still not forgetting about Epstein. Today is a day to do nothing.  Don't buy.  Don't sell.  Don't panic.

Just sit on your ass and do nothing.

Disclosure:  I am old and have learned the value of patience. Line goes up = ""LOL bears rekt! Trump is great for the economy, US market unstoppable, glad I went all in! Wonder how everyone who exited before is doing now lmao!""


Line goes down = ""Where are the bulls now?! Economy finally crashing as we all knew was going to happen thanks to Trump, US market ruined, glad I cashed out all my positions! Wonder how everyone who went all in is doing now lmao!"" So, for all the bulls saying ""tHe dAtA iSn'T bAd"" or ""when's the bad data coming???""

1mer2ky,2025-08-01,"Google stock and its future
Indeed, Google did a remarkable job in Q2, and its search business is doing well even though it faced existential threats from LLM. But I thought it would do well and eventually cross 200 USD and seem like a solid, well-diversified business. Therefore, I bought a few shares of Google at $197.  Even though my average for Google is 187, as I bought some shares earlier when it was in the 178-182 range, now it feels like buying some shares at 197 was a mistake, and I should have waited longer. 

It seems to be sliding down, and they will face some lawsuits regarding illegal search business monopoly soon. Now, the question is how it will impact Google's business in the future. Does that still hold if it gets some bad outcome, for instance, the new law may require them to sell Chrome, or Google can not be the default search engine? Will it still hold after the lawsuit outcome?
You bought a few days ago and now you're down and complaining ?

And you consider yourself a long-term investor ?

Get out of here. It just shows you have no idea what you're really doing.

If you truly understood the company you would have been happy it dropped so you could buy more. The fact that you're worried tells me you don't actually understand Google and are just throwing money around for a quick buck. 🤡 Why did you buy the shares then haha On the other hand, if it comes out that the lawsuits ended in Google's favor, the price may go up that much too. You blew thousands of dollars on one of the 8 most scrutinized stocks in the entire world and didn't know they had lawsuits?? Zoom out it just macro Eventually is a long time, and I’m sure eventually it will cross 200 and probably 500 and most likely split when it hits 1000 and it’ll be 100 again. OP - I would assume you bought google after doing research, with their strong recent earnings reports, and a well diversied business. Also knowing the legal case is hanging over them. I personally bought at $170 and even if it goes down, I know their long term outlook is bright. They are a monster. If you're a long term investor and you're getting rattled over this, you need to put all this away and let it be.

Most stocks are down today with tariff news. You're in for a rough week if you only care about the short term. [deleted] I'm confused, why did you buy Google then?

1mehwlc,2025-08-01,"Big 4 has spent almost a TRILLION on AI
In the last 3 years Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook and Google has spent close to a TRILLION DOLLARS on AI.

How much profit have they made from AI? Close to nothing.

Look at Microsoft. Co-pilot has basically been bolted on to Office. Then Microsoft jacked up the price. But would people actually pay for Co-pilot on its own? Most probably not. So Microsoft can brag this is AI revenue when we know the reality is people are being forced to buy co-pilot to have Office.

Even if we assume people want to pay for co-pilot it’s revenue is microscopic compared to the amount of money Microsoft is paying for AI. 

We see similar weak AI revenue streams from Google, Facebook and Amazon.

What happens in a decade after the big 4 have spent $1 TRILLION EACH on AI and have almost nothing to show for it? 


Nvidia says thank you! What about the fantastic 4 A decade is a long time. They’ll have a lot more to show for the investment in 2035 than 2025. In prior tech cycles people were too aggressive about the pace of change and too conservative about the magnitude of change. If that persists the big 4 will be glad they invested now. Microsoft doesn't have anything to show for AI? They've been able to cut tens of thousands of jobs while continuing to increase revenue. That's like striking gold for stakeholders. The benefits of AI are not only what you see on the consumer side. Another reason to invest is simply to not fall behind the other major players. Even if AI isn't super useful for the consumer yet you don't want people using someone else's services because yours don't look as good.

Many houses are known for giving out full size candy bars. 6-7 years ago, we go trick or treating with a big group of kids and my friend points to a guy opening the door with a big bowl of candy. Andy Jassy.

These were not full size candy bars. I knew then that the guy didn't have it. Fucker. Amazon is investing hundreds of billions into replacing it's entire workforce with robots.

Right now Azure growing at 39% and Google Cloud growing at 32% compared to AWS at 18%. The big thing driving growth the last 4-5 years was AI and they are not a driver like some of the other tech companies are. Along with that they are facing increasing competition on all fronts, retail and cloud. Before it was the Temu/Shein but now also Walmart is making inroads. Both Azure and GCP are making gains in cloud where AWS has been stagnating. On top of that all this tariff noise doesn't exactly help them either.

1meesrl,2025-07-31,"Mark Zuckerberg says anyone not wearing AI glasses in the future will be at a disadvantage
https://fortune.com/2025/07/31/mark-zuckerberg-meta-ray-ban-smart-glasses-ai/

> Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in the company’s second-quarter earnings call that people who don’t wear smart glasses in the future may be at a “pretty significant cognitive disadvantage” compared to those who do. Zuckerberg’s comments come as Meta has established a “superintelligence” lab fueled with highly paid researchers to progress on AI. The company’s second-quarter earnings reported Wednesday surpassed analyst expectations. 

> “I think in the future, if you don’t have glasses that have AI or some way to interact with AI, I think you’re kind of similarly, probably [going to] be at a pretty significant cognitive disadvantage compared to other people and who you’re working with, or competing against,” he said during the call.  

> Just like regular eye glasses that help correct bad vision, smart glasses will be the main way people access and use AI, as well as “superintelligence,” to which Zuckerberg’s company has dedicated a highly paid team of researchers led by AI wunderkind Alexandr Wang.

1meelvr,2025-07-31,"META will have to stop buybacks or offer debt to fund AI investment


https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000162828025036719/meta-06302025xexhibit991.htm

Page 7 ""Condensed consolidated statement of cash flows"".

In 2025 META has spent $46B on investment activities on the back of $50B in net cash provided by operating activities.  In q2 investment activities was $300M more than cash provided by operating activities ($25.6b v $25.9B)

They have also spent $35B on financing activities in 2025, $22B from buying back stock.  In q2 $16B was used for financing activities $10B from buybacks.

This has drained their cash and equivalent position by just over $30B in 2025.  To continue to fund their AI investments which are supposed to be another $30B for q3/4 and then $60B in 2026 they will have to stop the buybacks or take on debt.
Just fire more employees They just made $18.6B (net income) in a single quarter. That quarter included $10B in buybacks.

And their holiday quarter is usually something like 20-25% higher than their next highest quarter?

So that’s $18B last Q, probably $15-$18 next Q, and then like $22B+ the Q after that. They’re set to haul in another $40B in net income in the next 6 months or something, assuming the economy doesn’t implode.

Their current buyback authorization (how much they CAN buyback, as approved by the board), is $80B. 

So, at $10B buyback per quarter, they could continue to rack in like $70-$80B per year in net income, and exhaust the current $80B authorization in 2 years.

So, if that all stays consistent, then they’ll buyback $80B (about 5-6% of shares at current pricing), AND make like $160B in net income, in 2 years.

Don’t really see issues here, unless I’m missing something? they have 50B cash on hand and they have a massively profitable business. what exactly is the concern here? Literally only keep the top 5 employees, they should be able to handle everything youre aware that during the next 6 months, their business, a cash printer, is still running?

you are correct that D&A is an expense, but it is a non cash expense, meaning it does not affect their operating cash flow. So long as their FCF exceeds their capex + capex (which it does by a very large margin), META is completely fine.

  
you're wording this post as if it's 2008 and META is about to go bankrupt Vibe ceo-ing META is not a construction company. They don't truly need to do this but it's their passion project. Look at reality labs, if they eliminated that segment alone that would free up almost 20B in a year but they choose to do so because their core business is just so profitable. Buybacks and dividends are flexible and can be suspended at any time. Will the stock price dip? Maybe because they typically trade at a 20 PE and they're currently hovering near 30.

Aaaaand ... it's down 2% As long as their revenue keeps growing, they are on track to hit a trillion in revenue by the 2030s. If they can do this, keep the cloud lead, and continue investing in robotics, they will be a big winner in the next decade Advertising up 22% 

AWS up 17% 

Third party service up 10%

Subscription up 11%

Online retail up 10% 

The important, higher margin business, top 4, are growing double digit. 

Not sure what you mean by ""nothing to show for it"" Make that 4%. First UNH now this… boss i can’t take it anymore 😰 lol no way you got heavy bags for AMZN you must be regarded AWS was disappointing by comparison to GCP or especially Azure, but the valuation is so much cheaper than Wall Street implies. 35x earnings doesn't seem cheap at first glance, but that ignores the inevitable margin expansion.

For Microsoft to double margins, they would have to achieve ~90% operating margins. For Alphabet, it would be around 65-70%. These are obviously pretty unrealistic numbers, so the forward expectations come primarily from sheer revenue growth (GOOG still has room for higher profitability, but not explosively higher). For Amazon, getting to 20% margins would represent a double. That is not only realistic, but pretty much inevitable.

The fastest growing business segments are all EXTREMELY high margin from a unit economics basis, namely AWS, ads, and subscriptions. They could just continue on the current trajectory and comfortably hit 20% in a decade without really changing much. But this completely ignores the possibility for huge efficiency gains in logistics with robotics, self driving and delivery tech, and better inventory management. This also completely ignores the flexibility of their spending. They could just up and decide one day to basically never grow OPEX again, and the business would largely sustain itself at the cost of some revenue growth. 

Do your future self a favor and look past the optically high PE multiple and the unexciting AWS growth figure this quarter and ask some common sense questions about the numbers as they are reported. 10% margins are nowhere close to maturity, this company is only starting to pull the profitability levers. Make that 6%

Jassy has ruined that company. AWS is shit nowadays, GCP and Azure far better and gaining market share. And the retail end is so capital intensive that FCF longterm is not as great as it seems.

1me8fia,2025-07-31,"Will Alphabet ever escape the looming spectre of open ai and the feds?
Posted some pretty great numbers. Similar to Microsoft which is up 5% as a result. Alphabet was up a couple of days but now down a few days later.

Open ai announced 700m users daily and Google dropped 2% on the news. If the court remedy comes out to break up parts of Google it's gonna drop line 10% I reckon.

I'm not sure what would cause this stock to ever rise again honestly. 
It isn’t openAI at this point that is the bug concern it’s the sheer amount of anti trust allegations google is facing that is holding it back. I mean the epic case was decided today then in august the punishment from the first anti trust case then there is the pending 2nd anti trust case that hasn’t reached a fjnal decision. That’s a lot of pressure and i don’t think it’s the end yet either. 

Would not be surprised if they get yet another anti trust case for ai mode/overviews. Sometimes being the best has its downsides and google is definitely squarely in this position literally the perfect company with anti trust cases and accusations up the wazoo. He executes but is boring as shit and not a hype man. Todays markets reward the hype men The government and this administration would be so dumb to tear apart our country’s best shot at AI.

Wow, that's dramatic.  LOL. If they dont pay tribute to the 🍊 guy then I'm sure they'll find a way to make that dumb move Exactly.

They pile on the weak one that's known to not fight back.  They tried it with Zuck and realized they weren't getting anywhere, so they shifted focus on GOOG.

You need to realize, Gov antitrust is basically for show.  They just need to public to see they're doing something, so of course they're going to pick the easiest target Ford assisted with the inauguration logistics and donated money and still got shafted hard by 🍊 tariffs.

1me866i,2025-07-31,"GOOG - when will it take off?
I’ve been slowly and steadily investing in GOOG - by looking at the books, it looks like a strong performer. Over the last few years, I’ve invested around $20K in it. The returns are not as staggering as other Mag 7 - it’s one of the worst performer of my portfolio. Still at 50% absolute gains, but dwarfed by how other Mag 7 grew in that period. Eg: Meta, MSFT, Amazon and of course our beloved NVDA. 

So, want to know from this group  - when do you think this stock will take off? And any particular reason (apart from anti-trust) why it has not already happened? 
When you sell. When the judge figures out what they are doing with the company. can you sell? i want my shares to rocket Amazon? Amazon is the outlier here lol, they've underperformed VOO.

Also what's your time frame? Microsoft underperformed VOO last year. Now they're one of the best performers this year. Chill out people, have some patience. Google can go up 50% and still be undervalued compared to Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, etc. It’s a mystery. All they do is ignore the noise and beat earnings almost every single time and print cash and lead in AI, AV, etc. I would keep buying, the ruling will be bullish for Google no matter what. The beatings will continue until morale improves Netflix is up 420 percent crushing all 3 of them...

I get your point, I own Google too and they haven't been as stellar as other positions. But I still believe in them.

The market still thinks OpenAI and others will eat search. I don't agree but we'll see. The market destroyed Netflix 3 years ago and now that they've basically won the streaming wars, the market gave them their premium back. We'll see if the same happens to Google. Google Deepmind is the most likely of any lab to crack AGI in my opinion. Even if you don’t believe AGI is imminent they have also been the most impressive developer of narrow AI for previously intractable problems (eg AlphaFold which won a Nobel prize for solving protein folding). They currently have one of the best LLMs and the best video gen model. They are also possibly the only mag7 company with a full stack in house (they can make their own processors - TPUs)

I expect a major breakout in the stock price when they develop the first truly essential AI application. It could be in any number of fields, it could be an AI product (chatbot, real time video, etc) or it could be the fruits of an AI scientific breakthrough, eg a spinout company doing nuclear fusion or next gen solar energy. Google is a slow grower. Make it a cornerstone of your portfolio don’t trade it. Time period is roughly 3 years - in that

1me69dm,2025-07-31,"$FIG is indicating $95-100, per CNBC
That values it at \~$59B,  at $100/share, and implies close to $40B overvaluation. The article below has stale numbers but wanted to include for context.

>The indications, which are signals from market makers of the level where trading may begin, imply as much as a 112% gain above the IPO price of $33 apiece. The shares were marketed for $30 to $32 per share, after the company increased the range earlier in the week.

>The company sold 12.47 million shares in the IPO, which priced Tuesday, while investors including Index Ventures, Greylock Partners and Kleiner Perkins sold 24.46 million shares.

>The IPO pricing gives Figma a market value of $16.1 billion, based on the outstanding shares listed in its filings. Accounting for employee stock options and restricted stock units, the company has a fully diluted value of roughly $18.5 billion.

>Including restricted stock units for Chief Executive Officer Dylan Field, which are subject to vesting conditions, the fully diluted value would rise above $19 billion.

>The figure is approaching the $20 billion valuation Figma would have fetched in a planned sale to Adobe Inc. that fell apart in 2023.

>The shares offered in Figma’s IPO were approaching 40 times oversubscribed, Bloomberg News reported Tuesday, in a sign of robust demand for the first sizable software offering in the US since SailPoint Inc.’s debut in February.

>Figma is used to design web and mobile application interfaces. It has expanded its suite of products in an attempt to be more useful for software development and general workplace collaboration.

>Like many software firms, Figma charges clients based on the number of users and the kind of seat those users have. It added Dev Mode to the platform in 2023 to enable closer collaboration with developers, and has more recently incorporated AI technology into many of its own tools. This year it introduced Figma Make, an AI-based product that lets the user turn prompts into functional prototypes.

>Now that the company is public, “we have to continue to sprint, to push hard, and we can’t let the public markets distract us,” Field said in an interview.

>Going public allows Figma to have a big brand moment which centers the importance of design, Field said. “This is a time where we can create tremendous value for our community, our customers, and I think the public market is the right place to do it.”

>The company is growing quickly, with a 46% year on year increase in first-quarter revenue.

>A key question for Figma’s long-term success is whether it can become a tool used pervasively used by office workers beyond designers. The company’s suite of tools is seeing strong adoption by software developers, product managers, and marketers, said Andrew Reed, a partner at Sequoia Capital and a member of Figma’s board.

>Sequoia, one of the most storied Silicon Valley venture firms, first invested in Figma in 2019. Around this time, companies were beginning to adopt Figma’s product en masse, Reed said.

>The use of AI-focused software creation apps which are potential competitors to Figma, such as Lovable and Bolt, has rapidly increased this year. Weaving AI features through Figma is a top priority, Field said. “We have so much room to explore how we can make great AI products and experiences.”

>**IPO Volume Climbs**

>The IPO has lifted the volume of first-time share sales on US exchanges above last year’s pace. There has been more than $21 billion worth of US first-time share sales in the year to date, excluding financial vehicles such as blank-check companies, just behind the $20.2 billion raised in the same period in 2024, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

>Demand for Figma’s IPO was likely helped by an order-taking process similar to an auction. Prospective investors in Figma’s offering were asked to precisely state the number of shares they wish to buy and at what price, a person familiar with the matter has said.

>Field will continue to control the company with 74.1% of the votes after the IPO through his holdings of Class B shares that have 15 votes each, the filings show.

>The CEO and fellow Brown University student Evan Wallace started Figma in 2012. Field attended Brown for two and a half years before accepting a Thiel Fellowship, the Peter Thiel-backed program that provides funding to young entrepreneurs, provided they drop out of school. Figma was widely embraced by designers who warmed to its browser-based interface, replacing previous methods of collaboration involving sharing files individually.

>Figma had net income of $44.9 million and revenue of $228 million in the three-month period ended March 31, according to its filings. It reported revenue growth in 2024, though rising operating expenses contributed to a net loss of $732 million for the year.

>Adobe, a maker of software for creative professionals, walked away from the deal to buy Figma following clashes with regulators. It paid a $1 billion termination fee.

>The offering was led by Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Allen & Co. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The company’s stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol FIG.

1me5q6m,2025-07-31,"Absolutely everything you need to know about AMZN earnings today
Okay guys, so Amazon is set to release its Q2 earnings after the market closes today with an analyst call at 5 pm. This is gonna be a big one. Did anyone catch META yesterday? Fuck. 

For Amazon, analysts expect revenue around $162 billion (up 10%) and EPS between $1.32 and $1.33, with operating income projected at $16.7 to $16.87 billion. And during this sesh, the key areas to watch will include AWS growth (estimated at $30.77 billion, up 17%), AI investments (over $100 billion capex planned), and advertising revenue (up 17% to $14.99 billion). Considering the stock performance, it's up 5% year-to-date, with bullish analyst sentiments (e.g., UBS raised price target to $271), but some valuation concerns exist (GF Value at $189.47). External factors like tariffs and Prime Day success could influence outcomes, with potential for significant stock movement based on guidance. I know that people are going to be playing AMZN earnings so I wanted to do a little write up for /r/Stocks so you guys are well informed. And I'll even post what I plan on getting at the end. 

**Analyst Expectations and Financial Projections**

Analysts have provided a range of estimates for Amazon's Q2 performance, showing a lot of optimism. 

Revenue: Expected to be around $162 billion, with variations such as $162.1 billion and $162.19 billion, representing a 9.5% to 10% year-over-year increase.  

Earnings Per Share (EPS): Forecasted at $1.32 to $1.33, up from $1.26 last year, with Amazon having beaten EPS estimates for nine consecutive quarters.  

Operating Income: Projected between $16.7 billion and $16.87 billion, a 13.8% to 15% increase, with an operating margin expected at 10.6% (up from 9.9% last year).  

These projections suggest strong growth, and I honestly think Amazon can exceed these figures and provide robust forward guidance. Especially given its historical ""beat and raise"" pattern, which may not suffice in the current up cycle.

**Key Business Segments and Growth Drivers**

Amazon's diverse operations are expected to drive its Q2 results, with several segments highlighted as critical:  

1) AWS (Amazon Web Services)  

AWS remains a cornerstone of Amazon's profitability, with Q1 2025 revenue up 17% to $29.3 billion. For Q2, net sales are estimated at $30.77 billion, with growth of 17% excluding foreign exchange effects. However, operating margins are expected to drop to 35% due to significant investments in AI and infrastructure, part of a $100+ billion capex plan for 2025. This segment contributed 17% of revenue and 58% of operating income last year, making it a focal point for me.

2) Advertising Revenue  

Advertising is another growth engine, with Q1 2025 revenue up 18%. For Q2, it's projected to rise 17% to $14.99 billion, reflecting increased monetization of Amazon's platform as more businesses leverage its advertising ecosystem.

3) Prime Membership  

Prime membership grew 9% year-over-year to 220 million globally, providing a stable revenue stream through subscription fees. This growth, driven by benefits like free shipping and streaming, is expected to continue supporting Amazon's financials.

4) Operational Efficiency  

Amazon has improved operational efficiency, reducing fulfillment costs and increasing delivery speeds, which should enhance margins. These efforts are part of a broader strategy to balance growth investments with profitability.

5) Investments in AI and Other Areas  

Amazon's commitment to AI is a major theme, with a $100+ billion capital expenditure plan for 2025, primarily focused on AWS and AI services. This includes developing proprietary chips like Trainium2 and partnering with Nvidia to enhance AI capabilities. While these investments may pressure short-term margins, they position Amazon for long-term growth in the expanding AI market. Additionally, Project Kuiper, a satellite initiative, is noted as an area of rising expense, alongside e-commerce and content/advertising investments.

**Analyst sentiments are generally bullish**

UBS raised its price target from $249 to $271, calling Amazon the ""most coiled"" Big Tech name, implying an 18% upside and highlighting extensive investments across e-commerce, AWS, content/advertising, and Kuiper. Other analysts, including Wedbush, William Blair, and Stifel, reiterated ""outperform"" or ""buy"" ratings, with an average price target of $252.66 (range: $195 to $305). 

**External Factors and Market Context**

Several external factors could influence Amazon's earnings and stock reaction:  

Consider the Tariffs. Earlier this year, tariff concerns, particularly on Chinese goods, weighed on the stock, but recovery followed eased U.S. tariffs. Analysts are parsing impacts on e-commerce, with Amazon benefiting from stockpiling ahead of potential tariff hikes.

Also, think about the Prime Day Success. Held in July, Prime Day's performance could lift revenue guidance for the September-ending quarter, providing a positive signal for us.  

And finally, with any earnings post, we need to consider macroeconomic events such as inflation, interest rates, and consumer spending trends could affect retail sales, particularly in online stores and third-party seller revenue, expected to grow 6.5% to $58.99 billion and 7% to $38.74 billion, respectively.

**Potential Catalysts**

I'm expecting accelerating AWS growth, better-than-expected margins, new AI announcements, and strong Q3 guidance. UBS expects upward revisions to operating profit and free-cash-flow as revenue grows, potentially more dramatic than peers.  


**Comparisons**

Microsoft's recent Q2 results, where cloud growth was a significant driver, boosts my confidence in Amazon's cloud business, with MSFT stock jumping 4.47% in after-hours trading. This really does show how important AWS performance will be, as Amazon faces a high bar following Microsoft's strong showing.

**So what to do?**

Amazon's Q2 earnings are poised to be a major event, with strong growth expected across key segments like AWS, advertising, and Prime, supported by significant AI investments. This will be a great opportunity to get a call spread. For those who don't know anything about option trading, you don't need to continue reading. But for those who do, I'll be buying the 8/1 245c (@ 2.67) and selling the 252.5c (@ 1.11). This means I can get the spread for $156, with a potential max gain of 4.8x if AMZN can go up about 7.8% with earnings. Considering the stock moves on average about ±8% with earnings, there's a good chance it'll go up 4-8% today. 

Next week tho, we have a ton more earnings so I think I'll be doing a post on PLTR and AMD.

1me3nil,2025-07-31,"Is MSFT still a buy?
Microsoft has been a giant for decades. They continually print money while being that giant in the background while everyone else clamors for other tech names. They have pumped on cloud revenue and the expanding of their AI.   
  
I am in my first year of investing, and I'm wondering if MSFT after pumping post-earnings is still a valuable buy, or if I should wait for it to cool off. How much do they have room to grow, and is there a better play for pure cloud exposure? It would seem to me, their investment in OpenAI and Azure will be big for the AI industry moving forward, but there is the risk that AI doesn't find the profitability compared to spending people think it will. They clearly have the money to buy smaller players, and are still an industry leader for a reason.

Right now, I have positions in SNOW and GOOGL for cloud. Do you guys have any pure cloud plays that you are hot on right now?
Always the only single stock I would legitimately argue over certain sector based ETFs If MSFT collapses, something even crazier is happening in the world hah Probably the safest investment out there.

1me1eux,2025-07-31,"Trump lashed out at Powell again, but this time he might not be wrong? $SPY $QQQ $TLT
Trump recently took to Truth Social to once again criticize Jerome Powell, calling him “too late,” “too aggressive,” “too stupid,” and “too political,” and accusing him of costing the U.S. “trillions.” He even criticized the renovation of the Federal Reserve headquarters as “the most corrupt construction project in history.”

It sounds like Trump is losing his mind, but the key point is that he might actually be right this time.

Current Market Context July 31, 2025  

Federal Funds Rate: Still at 5.25%, with Powell maintaining a hawkish stance this month.  

June CPI YoY: 3.6%, lower than last month's 3.9% but still above the 2% target.  

Core PCE Data (just released): Held steady at 3.3%.

Labor Market: Last week’s nonfarm payrolls data slowed, with the unemployment rate rising to 4.2%.  

10-Year Treasury Yield: Back up to 4.5%, with $TLT getting hammered again.  

S&P/Nasdaq: Rebounded slightly after earnings season, but volatility is rising again as the market begins to digest the reality of “long-term high interest rates.”  

Is Powell really “too late” again?

To be honest, Powell has always been chasing the market, never leading it:  

2021: “Inflation is temporary” backfired.  

2022-2023: Initiated the fastest pace of rate hikes in 40 years.

2024: He paused rate hikes early, only for inflation to return.

2025: Now we're in a mild “stagflation” state, stuck between a rock and a hard place.

Trump may be harsh with his words, but the nickname “Too Late” isn't entirely undeserved. Powell always reacts after the fact, and the market has grown tired of his pace.

As for what he meant by “renovation corruption”?

Many speculate he's referring to the Federal Reserve headquarters (Marriner Eccles Building) renovation project, which has a budget exceeding $2 billion and has been significantly delayed, becoming a political joke for months.

So what should be done now?

The market is currently in a state of wait-and-see: bulls want to see rate cuts; bears believe inflation hasn't been resolved; Trump has already shifted the blame onto Powell. If Powell cuts rates too early, inflation could spike again; if he waits too long, the economy could hard-land.

Trump's statements may be bold, but they're not entirely irrational.  

Powell has indeed been slow to act, and now everyone is paying the price for his “lagging response.”  

With high interest rates and sticky inflation, $SPY and $QQQ are also waiting for a clear direction.  

Powell, it's time to stop being too late.
1) inflation is higher than it was in April
2) SPY/QQQ is at all time highs
3) being reactionary on interest rates is better than cutting too early and risking higher inflation

you need to do some more research “To be honest, Powell has always been chasing the market, never leading it.”

That’s what the Fed chair is supposed to do. 

Just like how Ben Bernanke reacted accordingly to the 2008 financial crisis. 

You think cutting rates is going to be good for the economy and prices? Forget the reported numbers and just go and look at your grocery bill. Now tell me if it’s a good idea to stimulate the economy with cheap money.

Sure, I’m an investor in stocks and have always been a net buyer, lower interest rates would be great for my investments. But I care about people’s cost of living and the long term future of the country way more than the value of my portfolio. “5.25%” either you used a shit AI to write this or you don’t know what you’re talking about at all He hasn’t been slow to act. Because that’s the job to react to data. You’ll always be slightly behind. Rates are not at 5.25 anymore haven't been for 8 months.... I think you're looking high inflation as 'horribly handled'.  You should also consider avoiding a massive, worldwide recession/depression as an possible result of the pandemic and re-opening of the economy.  

That we avoided that is a huge win that Powell isn't ever going to get credit for Lmao the original OP out here believing MAGA math. 

the bottom 90% consumers all had the largest tax increase in our lifetimes

And the deficit is accelerating at the fastest rate ever 

Inflation is back and no signs of slowing as the new taxes keep getting announced (tarriff rates changes every other week makes planning harder for the adults) Fed can lower rate but bond yield will never go back down because the trust between USA and investors is already compromised. Inflation is still running at near double their target inflation rate. Trump added inflationary pressures via tariffs himself. Why would the fed act ahead of data, it has to be a reactionary response because they act on actual data...

1me0p6y,2025-07-31,"Microsoft Nears $4 Trillion Market Cap After Another Strong Quarter  Reddit Earnings Tonight Could Surprise
Microsoft just dropped its Q4 earnings and, honestly, it’s pretty impressive. The company beat on both revenue and earnings again, with Azure cloud revenue hitting $75 billion for the year  up 34%. CEO Satya Nadella said AI and cloud are driving business transformation everywhere, and judging by the numbers, it’s hard to argue. The stock popped about 9% in pre-market trading, putting Microsoft within striking distance of a $4 trillion market cap. That’s insane.

Some analysts say FY26 will be the real AI breakout year for Microsoft  meaning this quarter is just the warm-up act. And with tools like Copilot gaining traction, it feels like the company still has plenty of runway. But here’s the thing: with shares jumping so fast, is now the time to buy more, or are we getting ahead of ourselves?

Meanwhile, Reddit is set to report Q2 earnings after the bell today. The stock has been volatile since its IPO  beating expectations on revenue and earnings but getting hit because daily active user (DAU) growth has slowed, partly due to changes in Google’s search algorithm that impacted traffic. Google still sends Reddit roughly 40-50% of its traffic, so that’s a big risk.

That said, some signs suggest Reddit’s user growth might be stabilizing, and their recent launch of AI-powered ad tools could be a game-changer. If they can show some real DAU growth or ad revenue momentum tonight, the stock might pop again. But how much of Reddit’s future is tied to Google’s whims? Is Reddit’s community strong enough to survive if that traffic tap slows?

Looking at the bigger picture, this AI and cloud run feels a bit like the early days of cloud computing back in 2020  huge opportunity, but also a risk of buying into froth. Are you leaning into giants like Microsoft and Nvidia that have proven track records, or are you more interested in higher-risk, higher-reward names like Reddit? And with Amazon and Apple earnings coming soon, August is shaping up to be an interesting month.
Reddit is up 8% pre market. ive definitely been telling people to buy Reddit for like a month The hype around earning beats is all fun and games, but much of it still reflects top-line results on paper. Over 50% of Microsofts revenue comes from international markets, which is beneficial for the revenue in the short-term.

That said, I am not so sure the same applies to Reddit. Bought in yesterday, so that's some good news! Hopefully earnings are banger. Outside of ETF's, Nvidia is my largest holding with Reddit coming in second. Average cost of 110 on Reddit. Waiting for the financial report information Just sold ALL of my AVGO.

Sounds like a super catchy/buzz wordy title that will draw plenty of clicks to his YT channel and generate him plenty of ad revenue.

It's important that you form your own opinions and do your own research. 750k USD is a lot of money to risk if you don't have  vast knowledge of the market.

Someone else has suggested that you put the money in a high interest savings account (& safest) and invest the money you gain. That seems sensible.

This way you will protect your 750k USD and scratch the itch you have to invest and also you will learn the markets/stocks while having a safety blanket.

If you do decide to invest 750k into stocks please set STOP LOSSES.

In my country right now the highest savings account I can find that is safe is 5% for one year (that's with a reputable US Bank). So if you can find that where you are you will gain 37500 USD - taxes (I guess) which you can invest happily while keeping your 750k safe. Don’t listen to him, the best time to buy is always yesterday.  People have said what he did for 10 years and missed extraordinary gains.  

He is effectively telling you to time the market, which is quite literally the worst thing a new investor can do.  Put money in now or soon with the mindset that you will not take it out even if things go down.  That’s how you learn as a new investor.  If that makes you nervous then DCA on a schedule, but historically lump sum makes more than drawing it out.

Though my advice is to put more than half of it in a broad market index like VTI or VOO.  Going heavy into individual stocks in one sector with all your money is very risky. Thanks so much for your input, I really appreciate it. Just curious where you saw 750k, The header says 'big lump sum'. Also, trying to figure out this platform! Thanks again for trying to help me and the wise guidance Well, and this comment alone makes me confident that you shouldn't be doing this at this point. 

Start DCAing in broad indexes, buying VOO, and potentially QQQm if you want more tech exposure. 

I'd still make sure to have at least 250k in short term bonds as the market is in a very dangerous spot right now and there may be opportunities to buy the dip in the short term. 

I wouldn't invest more than 10% of my portfolio in individual stocks at this point. Set 250k in short term t-bills, then start investing the rest in VOO/QQQm/individual stocks, while maintaining something like 65/25/10 ratio. 

And then see how it goes. I'd probably start with no more than 5 percent in the individual stock bucket at the beginning to be honest. 

Not a financial advice, but that's something that I'd probably be doing if I were in your shoes today Those are all solid bangers, but amd is probably the best one that’s missing. This is the way.  Drip that monthly interest into risky junk and see what happens


Risking that much money and lump atH is madness.  If we dip 40% that will certainly cause pressure Additionally, and without going into politics, the S&P 500 lost 5 trillion in value in two days when Trump did his tarrifs.

https://share.google/jje2MMnUyhRSJ46C4

Here says 15% but I think it was much closer to 18%

https://share.google/JSCpayaWetP8JWaTc

How do you feel about losing almost 20% of your lump sum becuase of the POTUS being irrational.

Got 750k from your previous posts IF you feel the need to fomo.... Set a stop loss, like 112k and let it ride, move the stop as we rise. In this market I wouldn't be surprised if one tweet caused a 30k gap overnight I mean I gave him two options of sitting this one out and waiting or putting 750k into a high interest savings account if there is one in the US and DCAing the interest gained into the market. I think the second option is much better right now becuase lets face it OP isn't exactly very knowledgeable on investing. (Not saying im Warren Buffet) but telling someone to DCA such a massive amount of money into the market right now is a HUGE risk.

But fuck it, not my money I don't care.

Whatever way you look at it S&P 500 P/E ratio is very expensive right, market is very greedy, insiders aren't buying.

1mdwtm4,2025-07-31,"Healthcare and tech stock, what's going on?
I rotated into healthcare ""undervalued, defensive, steady cash flow"" and I'm down 20–25% on names like CNC, MOH, and yeah, GEHC too. Watching GE HealthCare drop 6.5% the other day even after raising guidance? Brutal. Margins are getting squeezed by tariffs, and the market doesn't care about the long-term outlook, just immediate profits. Same story in every segment.

Also, like some other people, tech, AI, I've been DCAing into AAPL, AVGO, WRD and even a bit of MSFT again. Those moves felt smart a few months ago.  

I know people are bailing on healthcare and piling into tech now... same thing happened in reverse during April lows. The cycle is just... exhausting. But I'm still holding. Because health insurance isn't going anywhere. Premiums are going to rise next year and there's real talk about softening the policy damage. And tech? it HAS TO GROW, we're living in a time of forward momentum, not stagnation or decline.

I totally get everything, yeah. But selling now after averaging in?
I love these posts where OP is gradually trying to convince themselves they know exactly what they're doing but clearly have no idea You are losing money.

Why don’t you just buy the SP500 instead of gambling I had the same thought and went to diversify my tech heavy portfolio into healthcare….. they have not performed and I bought UNH which keeps dropping ….i will probably keep UNH long term - surely it is likely to recover?! I work in pharma and I can tell you the whole industry is being decimated. Tons of drugs going off-patent, loads of layoffs, R&D is being decreased, and FDA is not responding. Pharma and Biotech are most certainly in a recession and the stock prices reflect that. Even LLY, the poster child for success, is 25% off the highs for a year, NVO is down 60% with their weight loss drugs. It's a really terrible time. 

This is not exactly the same as healthcare industrial stocks, but im certain it trickles down and is in a similar position. “I keep putting money into this slot machine and I don’t get any back, what’s going on?” Well, we’ve all been there You’re buying at the top of a fragile economic situation So you’re rotating from winning companies with strong growth over the last few years into losers with declining or negative growth over the last few years. Not exactly sure why people think that’s smart. Then you go and rotate back into tech but pick the worst tech with slowest growth in their respective industries, again not that smart. At least the tech ones probably won’t lose money in the long term but they’re not the best picks atm. 



If you wanted to rotate into healthcare there are better options that have had growing revenue and cash flows the last few years. The administration is against Medicare and have been talking of cuts the whole time then yall surprised there’s cuts and shocked the companies heavily relying on Medicare income go down. 



You think insurance companies can just raise premiums forever? You don’t see any consumers unhappy with that and seeking alternatives? You don’t see any companies stepping in to be that alternative for consumers? HIMS? One medical? GoodRx? Cheaper urgent care centers? Like seriously people aren’t seeing the shift in healthcare? So many people think CVS is a big turn around and ignoring all the newer modern competition, same with UNH and CNC. 



I’m bullish on healthcare as a segment, we have a very old population and very unhealthy population, but people picks are fucking terrible. Picking the biggest losers just bc they’re dinosaurs and “huge turnaround” is dumb, they’re losing and down for a reason. If it was that or staying in “expensive” tech then stay in the tech that’s at least growing 20%+ a year. 



To answer your question more directly: what’s going on is that many people are chasing short term gains and just not looking at middle/long term trends. They’re making bad choices and trusting management that has proven they can’t make the shift society is so obviously pushing for. You are thinking like any of this makes sense anymore. The market moves depending on how everyone combined ""feels"" about it. Valuations don't mean much anymore. Just follow the hype. Why would you ever chase trends?

1mdva9x,2025-07-31,"BAT profit beats estimates as US, its biggest market, returns to growth
July 31 (Reuters) - British American Tobacco exceeded first-half profit estimates on Thursday as its U.S. business grew for the first time in three years, a potential turnaround in its largest market as new tariffs are introduced and consumer preferences shift.


BATS (BATS.L) said it expects annual revenue growth to come in at the top end of its forecast range.


The maker of Lucky Strike and Dunhill cigarettes said revenue in the U.S., which makes up about 44% of total sales, grew 3.7% at constant currency, with Velo, its nicotine pouches, helping sales of its new category products grow 3.9%.


Its smokeless products, which include Velo, Vuse Ultra premium vapour, and glo Hilo heated tobacco, make up more than 18% of total revenue.
BAT and peers such as Philip Morris (PM.N), Imperial Brands (IMB.L), and Altria (MO.N) are trying to capture a bigger share of the vapes, tobacco heating product and oral nicotine pouches market as sales drop in traditional tobacco products.


While most of BAT's products sold in the U.S. are produced locally, its Vuse vape devices are made in Indonesia, now subject to a 19% tariff.


CEO Tadeu Marroco said at a news briefing that BAT had front-loaded some stock to mitigate this in the short-term, but would look to absorb most of the tariff via its profit margin, adding that U.S.-produced liquids were a bigger part of its business.


BAT would also be exposed to higher costs via items such as packaging material, he said, though the impact of this was ""manageable"" and the company was watching how consumers would be affected by widespread tariff changes for the rest of the year.


It reported adjusted diluted earnings of 162 pence per share for the six months to June 30, compared with 159.4 pence a year ago, and a company-compiled consensus estimate of 154.8 pence.


The company said it was on track to achieve its 2025 financial forecast, with annual sales growth likely at the upper end of its 1%-2% forecast range.

Tech/AI earnings have been mostly solid across the board this earnings season. META was a good indicator that social advertising should be robust, which is promising for RDDT’s own earnings.

1mdpr4o,2025-07-31,"Microsoft tops $4 trillion in market cap after hours, joining Nvidia in exclusive club
The $4 trillion club has a second member, at least based on after-hours trading.

Following a better-than-expected earnings report on Wednesday, Microsoft shares jumped 8%, lifting the software giant’s market cap to about $4.1 trillion. Should the rally stick on Thursday, Microsoft would join chipmaker Nvidia, which hit $4 trillion for the first time earlier this month.

Microsoft reported 18% revenue growth, its fastest rate of expansion in over three years, driven by its Azure cloud computing business. Microsoft disclosed Azure revenue in dollars for the first time, and said sales from Azure and other cloud services exceeded $75 billion in fiscal 2025, up 34% from the prior year.

As of the close on Wednesday, Microsoft shares were up 22% for the year, topping the S&P 500′s 8% gain. Microsoft hit a record close of $513.71 on July 25. The stock is above $553 in extended trading.

Nvidia and Microsoft, two of the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence boom, have zoomed past Apple on the market cap leaderboard. Apple is third at about $3.2 trillion, with its stock having fallen 17% this year as investors worry that the iPhone maker is getting left behind in AI. Apple reports quarterly results after the bell on Thursday.

Among tech’s megacaps, Nvidia has been the best performer in 2025, up 33%. The chipmaker’s graphics processing units (GPUs) are the backbone of the large language models being developed by Microsoft, OpenAI, Google, Meta and others, and they’re filling up data centers being built by those same companies.

Nvidia is scheduled to report results in late August.

According to [InvestingPro](https://ca.investing.com/pro/QCOM) data, the company maintains a strong financial health score of 3.01 (rated as ""GREAT""), with a P/E ratio of 16.12x that appears attractive relative to its near-term earnings growth potential.

1mdov6r,2025-07-31,"Trump slaps universal 50% tariff on copper imports
President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed on order imposing a universal 50% tariff on copper
 imports, the latest metal he has targeted with a steep import tax.      

U.S. copper prices plunged as much as 18% in after-hours trading as soon as the White House announced the new tariff rate.      
why would copper prices in the US fall in response to a tariff that constrains supply? Man, I stopped trying to apply logic to this stock market a long time ago. For those wondering, it’s not on all copper. I was wondering why it crashed. Per NYT it applies to copper pipes, wires, rods, sheets and tubes and some other products like pipe filters and cables.

So for your stock info keep that in mind. This seems to be done under the same authority as the steel ones so I doubt this gets pulled back  US copper prices we are talking about cathodes and concentrates. These products are essentially raw materials for copper wires etc and are exempted.

The reason why the price fell is because (1) the US copper price (COMEX) was trading at a premium ~20-30% above LME prices in anticipation of the tariffs. Since there was no tariff on these raw materials, it tanked back to parity Stealing copper is back in vogue The opposite Sooo basically any infrastructure copper got it Nothing makes America more competitive in global manufacturing than massively increasing the cost of input materials. What's left, copper kitchen ware, and copper casting grains?
BB's maybe? Likely users of cast copper/brass/bronze products. So the electrical transmission industry and power providers, since switchgear uses cast components and linesman use cast hooks for grounding clamps and tools.

No. Hedging a position costs money (or something else) it essentially limits both up and downside. 

For example if you have a 60k portfolio you can hedge this by buying otm puts on spy. This put contract costs money but it gives you control of 100 shares of spy. If this put goes it’d you are protected from future losses for the duration of the contract.

1mdlham,2025-07-30,"Which one of these would you choose and why? NVO,UNH,PYPL
I'm considering adding one of these stocks to my portfolio. Which one would you choose and why? I understand that the healthcare sector is facing challenges this year, but I believe this will be temporary. Next year could be more promising for healthcare stocks. I've also included PayPal on my list. 

1. PayPal 
2. UnitedHealth 
3. Novo Nordisk 

Thank you in advance!
NVO.

Huge company growing by double digits per year. They have been fine for 100+ years and will be another hundred. NVO, double digit growth still even with the gloomy outlook, $15b in annual profits, and now a 4% and growing dividend due to the sell off…..this is one of those buy and hold forever stocks. I’d go with Novo Nordisk (NVO)-strong position in diabetes and obesity treatment,solid earnings growth,increasing dividend and overall very stable.

UnitedHealth (UNH) is also solid and stable, but with slower growth.
PayPal (PYPL) is more of a risky bet-it might recover,but it's facing a lot of challenges right now. those look like 3 stocks i don't wanna touch right now,  even with your money UNH. Their competition is still light years behind them and the percent of GDP going to healthcare in the US is still going up.  There is no way the DOJ would bar them from the Medicare advantage program as there are virtually no other providers.  PayPal and Novo are both facing increasing competition in the next few years and have not shown an ability to deal with it. I own all three and I am adding to UNH, sticking with NVO and selling PYPL. lmao at it selling off 30% because it guided 8-14% earnings growth, like any other company and 8-14% growth would be a good thing 
I’ personally went with UNH, it’s low and healthcare insurance will grow. More population growth more people need it. Susceptible to policy changes like currently experiencing but long term and if Democrats come in next term I feel like they’ll reinstate the Medicaid etc and these stock will fly even more UNH None… still better opportunities.

After meta and msft earnings, it basically confirms it. If you invest in anything else at this time, you're losing opportunity. Trying to find a loser that'll bounce back like unh and nvo is gonna kill you. I made that mistake for years and i regret it so bad. I literally could retire right now if 10 years ago I put everything into tech instead of trying to diversify. That's how bad it is to diversity in this era. I lost all my gains in LLY and now I'm just holding until end of year to harvest long term gains. I think it'll come back after their pill comes out. After that I'll be completely out of pharma too. Also look at copper, people who thought copper would go up is getting killed today. Why bother with these smart plays when you can just ride a massive ai wave?

Right now, the only sure thing is ai and all the support industries of ai like GEV, nuclear, vrt. All the semis. If you diversity, you're losing. They always try to scare you with semis are cyclical. Well it is but this cycle is still going up for at least one more year. Everyone is using ai everyday. We're only 2 years into the ai revolution.

Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT/)) [reported its fiscal fourth quarter earnings](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q4/press-release-webcast) on Wednesday beating analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines on the strength of its cloud revenue.

Microsoft stock climbed more than 6% on the news.

""Cloud and AI is the driving force of business transformation across every industry and sector,"" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement.

“We’re innovating across the tech stack to help customers adapt and grow in this new era, and this year, Azure surpassed $75 billion in revenue, up 34 percent, driven by growth across all workloads.”

For the quarter, Microsoft saw adjusted EPS of $3.65 on revenue of $76.4 billion. Wall Street was anticipating adj. EPS of $3.37 and revenue of $73.89 billion, according to Bloomberg analyst consensus estimates. The company saw adj. EPS of $2.95 and revenue of $64.72 billion in the same period last year.

Intelligent Cloud segment revenue, which includes Microsoft’s Azure business, topped out at $29.8 billion. Analasts were looking for $29.09 billion.

The company says it anticipated between $47.5 billion and $50.5 billion in third quarter revenue, well ahead of the $46.2 billion Wall Street was calling for.

Meta stock jumped more than 8% immediately following the announcement.

For Q2, Meta saw earnings per share (EPS) of $7.14 on revenue of $47.5 billion. Analysts were anticipating EPS of $5.89 on revenue of $44.83 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. The company saw EPS of $5.16 and revenue of $39.07 billion in the same period last year.

Imagine being a Meta employee who started in November 2022 when their RSUs would have been granted at around $90: https://i.imgur.com/bRAntik.gif Up 9% in AH

US Tech and anything AI adjacent is just absolutely dusting every other sector of the economy once again. Meta is building an all-star team that is like the Philadelphia Eagles of AI

Will they win the AI race? IDK. But they'll be in the playoffs every year I literally know someone who left for meta in November 2022, they can retire at this point. i dont think theres been anything in history as dominant as us tech is now. nvidia+msft are larger than the dutch east india company was, and theres another 20T of big tech under that.

  
after seeing the earnings today you kind of just have to take a step back and appreciate you are living through a once in a century moment. Same, I also know someone. I’m not kidding. I still remember him leaving for Meta and saying he was making his start date ASAP because “I want to get in now while the stock is low”. Yep, software engineer I have a cost basis of under 120$ for META. 

It was one of the easiest plays of the last 5 years. They were WAY oversold for what is a company that prints money. 

Every reddit criticism of them was completely unfounded. People still to this day state that ""no one uses METAs products anymore"" or ""only old people use METAs products"" and are completely bereft from reality. Meta is in a ridiculously good position right now.

Facebook and Instagram are money printers, to the tune of $45 billion *a quarter.* People raise concerns about Snapchat and TikTok and whatever else, but the company has perfected the art of acquiring and/or copying all their potential threats and ultimately staying ahead.

Their Metaverse effort was always a moonshot, and VR is probably an expensive mistake on their part, but they are getting good traction with AR glasses.

They have assembled the Avengers of AI, and in 6-12 months of development will have the tech to challenge OpenAI, Anthropic and Google. What they actually do with it remains to be seen.

Should both Metaverse and AI turn out to be complete duds, the company would have wasted a few tens of billions of dollars but their core social advertising model will remain intact, continuing to generate $50+ billion a quarter.

Should either one of them actually pan out, they will add *trillions* to their market cap. “Meta is dead.” > Idk if the metaverse is actually going to be what Zuck ever wants it to be 

This is a big misconception about metaverse.

Metaverse is not a fictitious alternate world, like ""Horizons World"" app. Metaverse refers to all METAs spending on wearables and AR. Zuck never dreamt of you going to a metaverse chipotle, that's a weird reddit meme. Instead it was integrating their products into your day to day life through wearables. I remember he did a demo of their micro-gesturing tech, and people literally only talked about the stupid horizons world app after and laughing about how the characters had no legs.

It's like your mom in 1999 seeing you in an AOL chat room assuming that's the entirety of ""the internet"". You try to explain to her this is just a chat app but she doesn't get it. Same thing with many redditors and metaverse.

1md9dh8,2025-07-30,"Roku's second quarter earnings outlook: Wall Street is optimistic about its partnership with Amazon and the growth potential of its advertis
Consumer electronics company Roku (Nasdaq: ROKU) will report its second-quarter results after the market closes on Thursday, July 31. Investors will closely monitor signs of growth in ad inventory, potential growth from its partnership with Amazon, and subscription growth.

Analysts expect Roku to report a loss of $0.16 per share and revenue of $1.07 billion, representing a 10% increase from last year.

Wedbush analysts anticipate that Roku will benefit from its DSP partnerships, high-quality inventory, improved targeting, sports-related advertising, and the variety of price points available on its platform.

Analysts predict that Roku's platform revenue will grow by 14% year-over-year to $940 million, in line with expectations.

Analysts stated, “Nevertheless, given Roku's increasingly diversified business model, expanding advertising opportunities, and achievable parameters across its entire operational model, we believe its guidance still has upside potential.”

Wedbush expects Roku to maintain its 2025 EBITDA guidance and 2026 positive operating income target, similar to the first quarter.

Over the past three months, earnings per share forecasts have been lowered four times, revenue forecasts have been raised twice, and revenue forecasts have been lowered 21 times.

Bank of America analysts recently raised their target price for Roku (ROKU) and reiterated their bullish rating, citing improved macroeconomic sentiment and the favorable impact of its recently announced partnership with Amazon (AMZN).

They noted that the partnership with Amazon “once again demonstrates Roku's intention to become more flexible and further drive interoperability within its platform.”

Roku (ROKU) shares rose over 1% during Wednesday's trading session. Year-to-date, the company's market capitalization has increased by over 21%.

1md6cp4,2025-07-30,"EURUSD falls to lowest since early July What does this mean for equities and macro?
With the recent macro situation, this could have a knock-on effect on equities and risk assets:

This morning, the EURUSD fell to its lowest since early July and is currently hovering around 1.0800. That's not a small drop, and a few days ago we were near the top of 1.09.

There are probably a few reasons at the heart of this decline: 

US economic data was too strong 

Q2 GDP was revised upwards to 2.8% (previously 2.3%).

Core PCE (the Fed's most watched inflation indicator) was higher than expected.

These data strengthened the market's expectations that the Fed will “keep interest rates high for longer” and made the dollar stronger.

ECB releases dovish signals 

Eurozone inflation data showed some easing.

Germany's latest PMI data is very weak, recession fears are rising again.

Some ECB officials are starting to sound cautious, and the market expects that rate cuts could start in early 2026 (and there are even suggestions that they could be possible by the end of 2025).

Safe-haven capital is pouring into the dollar 

Geopolitical situations are heating up (e.g. Ukraine, global trade tensions), allowing the dollar to attract a lot of capital as a safe-haven asset.

Meanwhile, U.S. bond yields remain firm 10-year U.S. bonds are close to 4.3%.

What does this mean for the markets?

Large tech stocks and those companies that are heavily influenced by the dollar (e.g., $AAPL, $MSFT, $META) could be under pressure, especially since a good portion of their revenue comes from Europe.

Multinationals (e.g., $PG, $KO, $JNJ) could take a loss in Q3 earnings due to exchange rate losses.

Eurozone stocks (which can be followed via the $EZU or $FEZ ETFs) could be pressured by economic weakness, but a weak euro favors German exporters, such as automakers.

Dollar-denominated commodities (e.g., gold, crude oil) could come under pressure in the short term due to a stronger dollar, unless macro risks push up safe-haven demand, such as gold.

My take?

Short-term weakness in the euro is justified, but the next thing to watch is whether US inflation continues to “stick”, and the Fed's attitude at its annual meeting in Jackson Hole at the end of August. If Powell is hawkish again, we could see EUR/USD fall to 1.07 or even 1.06.

Is anyone hedging their exchange rate risk with forex manipulation, long DXY (dollar index) options, or in company earnings reports? Would love to hear how people are laying it out.
What are you talking about? EUR USD is 1.15 are you drunk ? its nowhere near 1.08.

1.1468-0.0077(-0.6669%) Yeah ,1.147 Fed won’t hold the interest rate any longer. The correlation between Gold, USD, Securities, Macroeconomic are pretty complicated and the balance is not necessarily being acted as market is simply a bunch of people. Gold will decline further with less uncertainties while dollar will have a consolidation period if inflation is stable , GDP is growing and interest rates is declining. The balance between inflation and spending in US is somewhat stable in my opinion. 

In short, the factors that affect the price action on EURO will be similar. The revenue from the companies you listed are vital plus they are expanding harder and I expect the investment will only increase into India or emerging countries as it’s a known fact about tariffs.

1md68lp,2025-07-30,"Palo Alto Networks to acquire CyberArk in $25 billion deal

>[Palo Alto Networks](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PANW/) will [take over](https://investors.paloaltonetworks.com/news-releases/news-release-details/palo-alto-networks-announces-agreement-acquire-cyberark-identity) Israeli identity security provider [CyberArk](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CYBR/) in a deal valued at roughly $25 billion.  


>The California-based cybersecurity company will pay shareholders $45 apiece for 2.2005 shares of CyberArk, representing a 26% premium to its share price Friday. The deal is expected to close during Palo Alto Networks’ fiscal year 2026.  


>Shares of Palo Alto fell more than 7% before the bell Wednesday, building on a 5% loss from Tuesday. CyberArk’s stock dipped 2%.  


>“Our market entry strategy has always been to enter categories at their inflection point, and we believe that moment for Identity Security is now,” Palo Alto CEO and chairman Nikesh Arora said in a release Wednesday.  


>Blockbuster cybersecurity deals have been a force in the mergers and acquisitions market in 2025 after a relatively slow period for dealmaking. In March, Google shelled out [$32 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/18/google-to-acquire-cloud-security-startup-wiz-for-32-billion.html) for cloud security startup Wiz in its biggest acquisition ever.  


>Palo Alto Networks intends to use the deal to officially penetrate the identity security market and improve its multi-layer offering for customers, the company said.  


>He added that CyberArk offers a “foundational technology” necessary in the AI world.  


>The Wall Street Journal reported [Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/29/cyberark-shares-jump-on-report-of-palo-alto-networks-takeover-talks.html) that both companies had discussed a potential deal, sending shares of CyberArk skyrocketing more than 13%.  


>CyberArk, which went public a little over a decade ago, creates identity software tools that grant employees access to platforms and applications. As artificial intelligence advances, these tools have become more critical to protecting businesses against cyber and ransomware threats.
Biggest and second biggest Israeli exits of all time happening within a 4 month period. In the case of Palo Alto, acquiring another company means either dilution, shelling out a lot of cash, or taking on significant debt. Investors might see this as a bad deal.

In the case of CyberArk, there were already rumors of a potential deal that drove the price up, and shareholders may have been hoping for a higher price. Can someone eli5 why this caused such a sharp drop? Calls or no? LEAPS for me You mean $450 a piece Wiz Bought some shares of CYBR yesterday and it seems the deal will happen only on 2026, don't know if I made a bad choice or should I hold (looks like it had an initial drop today but it's slowly going back up) The news is not correct. Cyberark shareholders will receive 2.2 shares of PANW per share of CYBR. In addition to that CYBR shareholders get 45 USD per share. What is stated here makes absolutely no sense.

Isn’t he right then to hold the rates? How is he underestimating? Always reassuring to hear J Powell speak and be reminded there's at least one competent person left in government. The thing that bugs me the most is how Potus acts like he was elected CEO of every company, and all of their intellectual and physical property is somehow his to bargain with.  

This is how totalitarian regimes run things, until they stop running. For anyone who has heard or believes that Powell is a boogeyman, do yourself a favor and listen to this press conference.

As always, he explains very clearly and calmly what the Fed board is doing and precisely why.  

He’s nothing remotely close to the wild narratives.  

And today’s press conference isn’t unique.  This is literally who he is, every time.

He’s even polite and patient and informative when responding to dunderheaded smear questions from Fox News lackeys. Market open tomorrow will be fun JPM allowing people to buy crypto on their credit cards, lord this next downturn is gonna be spicy when it happens.

1mctc0m,2025-07-30,"How do market crashes happen?
Hi, so I've only just started putting a small amount of money into the market these past 2 years, and never actively followed it before. My question is that to anyone who remembers trading through the GFC and the dot com bubble bursting, what does it take for the market to reconsider how they valued stocks.

For example, does a crash start from one company crashing which reminds people to revalue their other holdings, or does everything crash at once from maybe a jobs report being worse than expected? 

Hypothetically, if a large stock like TSLA disillusioned a lot of it's investors and corrected by a significant margin, does that have potential to ripple across the entire market?

I couldn't find much information surrounding these questions elsewhere, so I was hoping some of you could help paint the picture for me.
When you least expect it, for reasons no one knows, with someone grandstanding 18 months later claiming they saw it coming and you should have listened. They happen a lot of different ways. Bubbles are probably the most common reason, such as in 2000/2001 and in 2008, but those also happened in different ways. 2001 was the market kinda working like it's supposed to--sorting out the winners and losers in a new glitzy sector. The housing bubble bursting in 2008 wouldn't have been such a massive problem if the world wasn't relying on a bunch of Americans paying their mortgages so that they could retire.

You have the Great Depression, which started with a market declining, saw a bunch of governments(the US primarily among them) tariffing one another, dragging down global growth, and then everything came crashing down.

You have Acts of God--COVID fits well here. You have wars, though they can often be good for business, unfortunately. Politics can do it: if the US goes mad and decides to default, the market would crash instantly. The Federal Reserve can deliberately crash the market by raising interest rates really high, like we saw in the 80s. There can also be deflation, though that seems to be something that has been mostly engineered out of economies with the exception of Japan ten years ago and China right now.

But Tesla going down isn't going to crash the market. Tesla is a company that I feel like we all secretly know is a shitty company that should be worth 30/share--if that.

\*EDIT\* I should point out, that a lot of these crashes take longer than we remember them taking. It's a 'slowly, then all at once' kind of thing. The Great Recession took over a year for the S/P to go from top to bottom. And that too.  Hindsight is always 20/20. 
. Typically no single stock will crash the whole market NVDA will one day Shucks, the present sounds like a mixture of all 3 of those precursors to the crashes:

- Tariffs - check
- Tech bubble - check
- Subprime crap - check plus add crypto The CountryWide Mortgage failure was an interesting event. Surely one company can’t cause a recession I thought.  Wrong.  Tip of the iceberg with a mess beyond comprehension of the mortals I hang with.  

Today?  I catch articles that the commercial real estate loan sector is in a bad state.  Is it?  IDK.  Will a correction in that sector matter?  No idea. ""Gradually, then suddenly"" is a quote from Hemingway when one of his characters answered the question: ""How did you go bankrupt?"" It's pretty hard to figure them out until you are underway. The GFC would have been a standard 2022 style correction bear market if it wasn't for all the mortgage exposure. You're never going to figure out who has what on their books to that degree because it's cross-hedged, leverage is unknown. It's one of the wild cards. A better example might be 2001 to 2002 where we had an equally devastating decline in equities and even worse in tech but people were generally alright. The scary part about 2001 and 2002 is the setup is not that much different from the one we are currently in. You had rampant speculation in tech stocks, earnings were accelerating, they were kind of laughable because many were like one cent per share but at any rate it was going from one to two to three. You also had a lot of unprofitable companies trading at ridiculous numbers. Today Tesla makes no sense, palantir makes no sense, Google does make sense, asml and applied materials make sense but you're beginning to see some scary things happen. UPS was one today. You know that company most of you don't pay attention to that delivers all your packages. They are taking a real hit in shipping volume and if shipping volume is down it means people are buying less . How long does that take to translate into the economy because also remember in 2001 the Fed was actively cutting rates. That particular market turned into more of a rotation though because housing and commodities began to boom. Everyone wanted to own steel in mine stocks, oil stocks. I'm not sure if that would happen this time but there would likely be some type of rotation and we have already seen some of the extremely speculative stocks like corweave go from $40 up to nearly $200 back down to $100. Then you think about the crypto market, if we put in a top on that towards the end of the year you actually might have a top in the market. That remains to be seen but it's a working theory that I'm keeping in the back of my head Countrywide and Bear Stearns definitely were the canaries and there was a constant barrage of euphoria in real estate and private equity deals hitting the WSJ. Blackstone, KKR, Apollo, etc were constantly in the news.

Kushner bought the most expensive building ever at that time 666 Fifth Ave. They say such large skyscraper deals happen at the top.

Btw I didn’t know it was Epstein who triggered the collapse of Bear Stearns by withdrawing 200m of investments in CDOs.

1mcranr,2025-07-29,"Is Oklo/SMR/TerraPower the next NVDA/AMD/Intel?

Ok so here’s how I’m seeing it.
Everyone’s focused on $NVDA, $AMD, $INTC, but they’re just one piece of the whole puzzle. Here’s how I see it: AI needs constant computational and electrical power. Not just for the data centers and the fabs that make the chips, but the chips themselves burn power 24/7. The more models scale, the more energy they eat. That power has to come from somewhere. Big tech ceos are already talking about potential future power shortages if we dont come up with something better than what we have rn
So here’s how I’m thinking about it:
We started with AI companies throwing money at chip companies →chip companies throwing money at fabs like TSMC →fabs and AI centers pulling insane amounts of power off the grid →and now we’re about to see power companies (especially nuclear) get flooded with cash →and that means the uranium miners feeding those reactors are next in line.
This is how i see the chain:
AI companies → NVDA / AMD / INTC → TSMC / Samsung → SMRs like Oklo / SMR / TerraPower → uranium miners like UUUU / NXE / CCJ.
Every stage up the chain got paid. The last ones left to run are nuclear and uranium.
I think we’re about to see a repeat of the same pattern within the next few years as we experience energy shortage. Just like how NVDA and AMD dominated chips, I think a couple players will dominate nuclear. Right now we’ve got:
* Oklo (backed by Sam Altman, just IPO’d $10.5B)
* NuScale / SMR (~$6.8B)
* TerraPower (still private but Gates-backed and getting a ton of attention)
That’s probably the big 3. Others will show up, but like everything else, a couple names are going to take 80% of the market and leave everyone else behind.
Same goes for uranium. CCJ is the king, but NXE and UUUU are getting attention. Supply is tight, and if nuclear demand explodes, miners get squeezed upward just like GPU demand squeezed NVDA.
So yeah, are Oklo / SMR / TerraPower are the next NVDA / AMD / INTC  just further up the chain? The ones getting paid by the ones getting paid.
I’m looking at LEAP calls and they are not that expensive while they’re still under the radar. It’s the last piece of the AI/infrastructure puzzle that hasn’t run yet.
What do you guys think? Am I early? I just dropped a few grand on $UUUU and OKLO july 2026 calls so Im seaking guidance from fellow degenerates. Also I know were still years ahead of nuclear, but I have a big FOMO…
NVDA was already making billions in revenue before hitting hyperdrive, those companies don't even have revenue yet. Is oklo, the company that has already gone 7x with no revenue, the next nvda? I doubt it OKLO and SMR pumped like crazy already. Smart money got in before that. WTF ARE YOU ON?

NVDA had the GPU market cornered. GTX 1080 released in 2016, you may not have heard about it, but if you played games or ran visual software, you KNEW NVDA.

Thats why it exploded. it already had dominating market share, so when the wind started blowing it way, it shot for the moon. They’re already priced in for 2040 revenue. All those tickets will experience 80% draw downs over the next year Oklo will make money before mass adoption. 
Look into the liberty power partnership, Chris wright’s tie ins, and isotope provision. 
If it can become only the next CEG you have 500% to run. 
It’s a good bet, but yes it is speculative and pre revenue. No, they're high risk. They're all high risk. Think for a minute and write down a consecutive list of all the regulatory hurdles. From the NRC to the IAEA. To the state and local governments. To the regional environmental impacts and risk assessments from stakeholders in the community. There's the regulatory risk from the EPA and the DOE. Then there's the risk of manufacturing and constructing a plant. If there's a small issue with hardware regulating temperature cooling, or controlling isotope waste purity. Even if there's a much smaller issue of some element of the compatibility of some simple non-reactor related parts. This may affect the entire design of the reactor and it might need to go back to square one for approval from the NRC, IAEA, DOE... Etc. 

There's also the very real risk of a community simply rejecting having a nuclear power plant in their backyard. And there's the very real political risk that in 4 years there's a new administration that wants to take a heavier hand in regulation to slow walk nuclear development more safely. There's also the other very real risk of scalability. SMRs designs make the promise to bring economies of scale to the nuclear reactor manufacture, this lowering the overall cost. But can you really see a US built reactor being shipped overseas to Europe, Asia, the middle east, south America? These other countries would much rather support their own local industries in their efforts to bring nuclear, rather than support a US based company. The potential scale of this industry has a ceiling, even if the rare scenario that theyre adopted quickly in the US, there's a snowballs chance in hell that these innovative designs from these US based companies will be exported to other countries. 

I'm sorry but I agree with your perspective of the bull case. But for you to not acknowledge the fact that there are very real risks to a nascent industry that hasn't even broken ground on any real projects yet, is simply short sighted friend. Yes, big money CEOs are talking about nuclear, and new reactor designs, and blah blah blah. 

I have small speculative amounts in OKLO and SMR fwiw. But I have zero intention of raising my exposure to these. A sign of intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function. They are just speculative bets. The only one with a path to profitability is OKLO, which has a plant planned to be built (start breaking ground in 2026 iirc) outside of Boise and another plant  for an air force base in Alaska. OKLO also has their own uranium supply as well as a clear path towards regulatory approval.

SMR (nuscale) has intriguing designs, some major regulatory approvals have cleared, and no true plans or partnerships that have solidified any actual plants to be built. 

This is not the future NVDA, unless they are. I'd take 1000:1 odds that they are the next big thing. I agree with you that this country needs to learn in to high quality cleaner nuclear power, especially the unique breeder reactors. I agree that there's a lot of room for this space to grow. Will it grow though? It's all just a speculative gamble. Investing in nuclear right now (unless it's CEG or GEV) is basically like investing in early clinical phase biotech. High risk, high reward. CEG or GEV have a clear and boring path towards profitability. 

The biggest risks to OKLO or SMR (if they actually finally do clear all regulatory hurdles and actually build real plants) is that their initial promise if low cost electricity actually ends up being a higher than originally promised cost. Well, that's just one of the risks. If they can actually prove that nuclear power using these SMR designs is actually cheaper, yeah these could 3-5x in a couple years. Nah NVDA traded between 14 and 45x earnings not revenue for the majority of its early days. This is a classic bubble. We likely get an implosion at some point this year or next, and maybe some of these companies start to ramp revenue at a realistic valuation in 2027 2028

1mcqnzm,2025-07-29,"Is it more complicated?
21 years old with one year of ""experience"" in investments I am trying to understand if UNH and NOVO NORDISK (here I am already -22%) are really an opportunity. The share prices of the two companies are the same as they were 2-3 years ago .I compare the financials of the two companies with the financials they had in 2021-2022 and they are clearly better and it seems based on the 2026-2027 forecasts that they will continue. So doesn't that mean that if we look at the long term 1-2 years not rushing to make a profit the prices of the two stocks should go up?
So why is the subreddit called ""Stocks"" and not ""index funds""? “Just a company in the space” …yeah this is why I never take this sub seriously.

For over 100 years Novo Nordisk has been in the insulin business with giant market shares in both diabetes treatment and weight loss. Their r&d team is the best in the world, and their manufacturing scale is second to none. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly will have a duopoly in the weight loss market just like they did with insulin. I’m talking 90% split between both of them while the real “just a company in the space” fight for the remaining 10%. unh? probably. novo? probably not.

unh is the leader of their industry, and it's an industry that the country **needs** (and literally forces people to buy against their will in some states). they are  absolutely a ""too big to fail"" company and the healthcare sector will eventually swing back into favor.

novo nordisk is just a company in the space. there's nothing inherently special about them, and they have much more serious competition in their space. So I ask you again, why isn't this subreddit called index founds? The foundation of a good personal portfolio is index funds. Individual stocks are awesome, that’s why we’re here. But when a 21 year old kid who has no idea what they’re doing is asking for stock advice, we should all be recommending that they build a foundation in indexes before picking individual stocks. Most of us have the disposable income and portfolio foundation, to take risks on individual stocks. It’s unlikely that OP does. UNH is being investigated. More people are also coming out to report how bad the insurance company is. Novo produces Ozempic and there are reports of bad side effects. The cuts to medicaid will affect insurance companies. The cuts to science research will affect pharmaceutical companies. If you want those two stocks, keep up to date on budget cuts and market sentiment. May take time to make money. I suggest VT or VOO if you don’t have the time to research individual stocks Exactly right There was someone that went into UNH calls in the other ""investing"" sub. It went real well!

1mcmbaw,2025-07-29,"Google’s “monopoly” breakup is a Swiss Cheese stance
How are people going to argue Google has a monopoly in search, and then the next post will say “Google search business at risk from OpenAI and other AI tools”. Make up your mind. 

There’s no way Alphabet will be broken up over them being a “monopoly”. FOH. 
My real issue here is that if you value the different business segments of Google it’s worth more than Google is worth today. There are undeniable benefits of everything being under the same company, but there are also some potential benefits of being broken up and out from under the thumb of a massive business that’ll cut spending on good products for no reason. 




If Google isn’t broken up, great it’s an amazing company and valuation should go up once it is settled.




If Google is broken up, great I know own parts of several amazing businesses that will likely start out at a higher cumulative value and then thrive for years. The search business isn’t even at risk. People need to get their head out of their ass. Ever heard of LLMs? What do people think AI gets info from? If it stays together I think AI will allow different google products to integrate with each other even better than they already do. There's so much potential for Google it's hilarious that some are scared of AI implications. It's like being scared of Apple in 1995 because Windows PCs were growing as the internet became mainstream. Standard Oil's market share had dropped from 91% to 64% **before** they were broken up in 1911.

I followed the *United States vs. Microsoft* on a free OS which worked way better than Windows.  Microsoft lost.  The case was overturned on appeal, but only for procedural reasons; the matter was eventually settled out of court.

What you think of as a monopoly has little to do with how an antitrust case is likely to go. I think this is an overblown and irrelevant ""concern"" that keeps getting repeated. Take a look at Google's financials last week. IMO, Google is going to profit from AI more than anyone. AI features mostly make SEO redundant, which Google does not make any money from, only marketing agencies.
If you wanna be visible next to AI summaries, you're gonna have to pay for Google Ads, which directly goes to Google. FYI Microsoft was the one who bleed out Skype.

Google has definitely done the same but mostly with hardware like stadia or google home. It doesn’t matter. The DOJ ruled Alphabet has a monopoly in the ads business, and that’s not very far from the truth, even with the LLMs disruption threat. 

But yes the LLMs threats can be used as arguments by Alphabet’s legal team. 

Will it be broken up ? I have no freaking clue, but I hold Alphabet and sometimes I wish it will be, that could unlock massive value. I wouldn’t be surprised if lot of institutional investors wish for a break-up too. Do you think Reddit is just one person posting? Is he in the room with you right now?

1mcm7th,2025-07-29,"Spotify drops 11% for worst day in two years on weak guidance
Spotify shares dropped more than 11% Tuesday for their worst day since July 2023 after the music streaming service fell short of Wall Street’s expectations and posted weak guidance for the current quarter.

Here’s how the company did versus LSEG estimates:

* **Loss:** Loss of .42 euros vs. earnings of 1.90 euros per share expected
* **Revenue:** 4.19 billion euros vs. 4.26 billion expected

The Swedish platform’s revenues rose 10% from about 3.81 billion euros in the year-ago period. The company posted a net loss of 86 million euros, or a loss of .42 euros per share, down from net income of 225 million euros, or 1.10 euros per share a year ago.

Spotify said that higher personnel, marketing and professional services costs and 115 million euros worth of what it called social charges contributed to the results.

Third-quarter guidance came up short of Wall Street’s forecast.

The company expects revenues to reach 4.2 billion euros, compared to a 4.47 billion euro estimate from StreetAccount. Spotify said the forecast accounts for a 490-basis-point headwind due to foreign exchange rates.

Monthly active users on the platform jumped 11% to 696 million, while paying subscribers rose 12% from a year ago to 276 million. Ad-tier subscribers account for over 60% of Spotify’s monthly users.

For the current quarter, Spotify said it expects to reach 710 million monthly active users, with 14 million net adds. The company expects 5 million net new premium subscribers in the third quarter to reach 281 million subscriptions.

Spotify’s advertising-supported revenues declined about 1% to 453 million euros from 456 million euros a year ago. The company said it sees promise in its advertising stack and demand given its strong user base and will focus on adoption and new tools in the second half. Some areas of opportunity include business and automated ads.

“It’s really an execution challenge, not a problem with the strategy,” said CEO Daniel Ek during an earnings call. “While I’m unhappy with where we are today, I remain confident in the ambitions we laid out for this business, and we’re working quickly to ensure we’re on the right path.”

Ek said the company is seeing some “promising signs” in its programmatic business.

Multiple news outlets reported this week that Doordash had poached the company’s advertising head as chief revenue officer.

During the period, Spotify said it rolled out a request feature for its artificial intelligence DJ. The company said engagement with its AI DJ has roughly doubled over the last year. Its audiobooks feature expanded to four new countries during the quarter, and listening hours jumped 35% in the U.S., U.K. and Australia.

Earlier this year, an indie rock band on the platform known as Velvet Sundown gained media attention after it quickly captured over a million new listeners and raised questions over artificial intelligence use in music creation. The “band” was later confirmed to be mainly AI-generated after widespread speculation.

In 2024, Spotify posted its first full year of profitability as it slashed costs and hiked prices. Over the years, the company has prioritized subscriber gains and invested beyond music in podcasts and audiobooks. Apple Music remains one of its top competitors.

Spotify said it ended the quarter with more than 7,300 full-time employees and upped its share repurchase program by $1 billion. Shares are up more than 40% this year.

Spotify’s doesnt even know how to implement a working shuffle. 

I love spotify but im tired of hearing the same songs in a 1000 songs playlist! Used to work on the product team at Spotify— imho the only thing keeping them in business is its branding/name. I’ve never seen a company so bad at managing itself in my life and their corporate bureaucracy and internal politics impede them from growing in any meaningful way.

For instance, when I was there, the top priority was developing their new luxury tier called “Supremium,” which was set to cost $20 per month and feature high-quality audio and expanded data capabilities— however it was so poorly managed, it plummeted from the first priority to the sixteenth in 2024, and it has yet to be released; and they’ve been working on it for 3-4 years lmao Spotify is too cozy. They haven’t updated audio quality years after saying they would. Their shuffle and discovery is atrocious. And the competition is arguably outshining them. I hope they get the reality check they deserve Still seems pretty overvalued to me Youtube Music does the same shit to me. I have tested this. Yeah, I think their downfall will be not owning their content. 

Netflix was able to create a giant moat by owning one of the largest libraries of content, which led to more subscribers, more subscribers means more revenue, which meant more money to spend on more content, and so on (not sure if this is a flywheel or network effects or whatever).

Everything that I listen to on Spotify can be found on like 3 or 4 other apps (whether it's podcasts or music). 

This model means that Spotify is simply a middleman that gets squeezed from both ends - Creators want a bigger cut and consumers want to pay as little as they can. 

UX and inertia can help keep people around, but it's gonna put a ceiling on Spotify's valuation, which should be a heck of a lot less than Netflix. Try the same 100 This is not shocking. Also Spotify is a software solution platform that doesn't own anything. They will always have to rely on labels/right holders, who own the masters. It seems….intentional? Like, if I download an album and just shuffle my whole library it will only ever play the singles and hits. Feels to me like the app is trying to maintain my engagement by only playing the best of the best. I wish I could view stats like “how many times his track has been played” because I know for damn sure “Schism” has played 30 times for every “Mantra”.

1mck70z,2025-07-29,"The rally is losing steam, I'm watching these levels for SPY & QQQ
I'm sure many of you folks are thinking the same -- this rally seems irrational. If you zoom out on either SPY or QQQ you'll see how the slope of the line is very gradual for the last one month or so. The volatility has been very low, and the supports are also very tight. Everyone has their own way to chart and determine breakouts, but these are my levels. 

SPY: $627.10  
QQQ: $563.50

As you can see, we're \~1% away from these levels. I will be watching if the respective underlying ETFs have a \*daily close\* below these levels. If they do, there is a possibility that a downtrend might start. 

I've been watching the charts (SPY, QQQ, futures etc) for months, and this is NOT a 'trust me bro' kinda post. The tools are use are purely mathematical and do not have any bias (like analysts do).

Edit: Since every comment is ridiculing me, I'm going to keep monitoring my support levels, and *if* they're broken, I will post again with my short / put position.
Note: I have NOT said that the market has already started a reversal. I'm merely sharing with the group, the levels that *I am* monitoring. Did I suggest that you short the market? No! Then have some respect, and give the benefit of doubt. Who knows!? I might be the guy who predicted the timing of the next crash before anyone else could! 😉 (well take this in a lighter vein, you fuckers!) 
0.3% off ATH is losing steam? We just hit ATH this morning Technical analysis is not mathematical. If it was that easy to predict markets you wouldn't be on reddit. Technical analysis is basically astrology for men. It is astrology for the stock market This is not a “trust me bro” kind of post? On April 15th you posted that you will not go long because your technical super indicator tend line blah blah blah. Then 2 days later you posted about unemployment rising and people panic selling their stocks to meet their basic needs. 

How has your technical analysis done so far..The S and P is up 20% since that post. I’m sure your technical analysis will be right at some point. The question is how much gains will you have missed out on until then? ""supports are very tight"" is a nonsense phrase, even in TA-land. It's almost as nonsense as the ""underlying ETFs"" of SPY and QQQ. You tell me. I’m just reading your post about the market only doing dead cat bounces and falling and people panic selling to meet basic needs. So maybe you were buying during that time. This doesn't prove anything. There has not been any research showing that technical analysis works. Technically analysis is one step away from palm reading Ehhh, there are finally actually some troubling signs here and there. The two biggest ones being IWM being very heavy since Wednesday last week and the Nasdaq giving up a couple of ramps in a row now.

1mcinlc,2025-07-29,"What is the current sentiment for the future of healthcare?
Personally Healthcare is around 22% of my portfolio so ive taken a big hit recently but generally believe it will rally back. Though the market doesnt seem to believe that - i also have concerns with the big beautifull bill where UNH will lose alot of potential earnings and theyve lowered forecasts, also with Novo Nordisk who has also lowered forecasts, they are the ones that made me take the biggest hit. 

it seems like the market has a very negative sentiment on healthcare.

Rule 1: I own Novo and UNH which together adds up to around 22% of my portfolio.
The valuations right now look very attractive. Meanwhile every single other asset class and sector is overextended. Be greedy when others are fearful. There’s so much negative sentiment around NVO and UNH that this is when you buy for long term holds.

Short term, both could suffer more. But long term, NVO will continue to have its patent in the USA until 2031, and UNH is too big to fail. And again, when there’s an overwhelming negative sentiment, that’s when it’s a good entry point to buy So you never had an investment fall more than 10% the past 4 years? There is still a lot of damage trump can do in 3 and a half years to health care. Remember this is early
Into his term and health care/ pharmaceutical seems to be his target to negatively impact Well RFK believes medicine shouldn't exist and Dr Oz believes Medicare/Medicaid shouldn't exist, what do you think?

Holy Shit! That is a lot of 'buying'! Dude, STFU. Too big to fail. Largest health insurer in the United States. Very oversold right now. Proper value is high 300s/low 400s >because some random dude on internet was yelling ""overvalued"".

LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO you can't be serious Of the last 10 trades of UNH stock involving people in congress or senate only 3 have been purchases although confusingly Ro Khana sold and bought back the stock on the same day 

According to the SEC since start of 2025 of the 6 insider transactions on UNH stock 5 have been purchases and 1 has been a sale 

Overall this presents a very juxtaposing overview - in general I think the stock will recover but there's a bumpy road ahead 

Also as a general rule of thumb never go by what some guy on youtube tells you for stock advice Did you hear it in the local supermarket too? Pump and dump scam? I know.

Hello everyone

I would like to start with thanking you all for the amazing information on this sub.

I’m 31M in a 2nd world country. Happens that in the last 8 years I’ve been buying 500 usd of MSFT stock because I strongly believe in it.

Also reinvested dividends into buying more stock in the last years

For the first time I will have to sell some shares for a person project in the next month.

The results are tomorrow after market.

Question:
Should I sell today or August 1st? I think earnings will beat but already priced in

Don’t judge me. My portfolio is 100% Microsoft but I did an all in

Current position: 
150k - around 300 stocks
If you’re looking to close your position, why don’t you sell 3 calls? lol I hope you held onto your shares! This is an excellent suggestion, OP. If you have time you may get enough cash via premium, if you don't have time you could sell ITM and pretty much guarantee you get enough for what you need Yeah I did! If u think they have higher earning and tariffs won’t hurt them then wait if not sell Very good that you decided to hold. It's the same for me, I'm gonna sell my very positive options in the coming minutes (I think xD) I’m expecting them to boom with the china deal.

1mce57d,2025-07-29,"Meta Capex and Opex will shake Wallstreet to the core.
(post translate and enhanced with AI) 

The AI fever continues driving the market to record highs.

After blowing through $60 billion on the Metaverse, Zuckerberg is now racing to lead the charge for super intelligence and infinite gains.

While I'm somewhat skeptical about this strategy of hiring a bunch of rockstar researchers who have never worked together and expecting them to perform miracles, we all have to admire Zuck's boldness.

But my point here is about whether Wall Street truly understands the magnitude of spending that Meta is committing to, and how this will affect financial results in the coming months and years.

I can't think of any similar example other than Meta itself between 2019 and 2022 with the Metaverse. And even this seems to be an order of magnitude larger.

Perhaps a similar positive example would be Microsoft's pivot to the Cloud in 2012. But in that situation, there was only one major competitor (AWS).

To wrap up: I expect that tomorrow we'll see much stronger movements in companies like Nvidia, AMD, Dell, IBM on the upside and Google and Oracle on the downside.


The Big Beautiful Bill’s impact on capex to cash flow will be a tailwind to earnings You are mistaking desperation for boldness, if they don’t come out on top for an AI they are done Companies can expense 100% in year one rather than a phased schedule. That will impact earnings near-term One of the few Reddit posts about earnings that actually aged well, you ended up being pretty spot on. After today I think I’m gonna back up the truck for META, big things ahead for them. what is new, previously it was metaverse now new. does this AI generate ads or fills up more AI genrated content for photo, video modification This aged like Milk. They are pumping 12 and 8% AH, META and MSFT, while dragging NVDA and AMD with them can you go more in depth into this? curious thanks Expense or depreciate?

Depreciating the year an asset is put in service is wild and makes no real world sense but ok whatever. Wall St needs is numbers to go in one direction.

Getting the R&D credit back as it was is more important. Spreading R&D opex as if it's capex I just have no idea what anyone was thinking there. They aren’t playing games. The US public company accounting reporting and auditing standards weed a lot of this out if it happens in a material way. Meta is making more money than ever. This is due to advertisers having more success with customers buying their products from ads run on Meta’s platforms.

1mccmzq,2025-07-29,"Better to swap NVDA with AMD?
I mean let’s be honest Nvidia is at like 4.3 trillion mc and the chances of it doubling in the next year or two is almost negligible ? I’m wondering if I swap my NVDA with amd and amd is showing a promising company now with their cost effective high performance chips coming out. And most importantly the chances of amd doubling is way higher than NVDA right now as their mc is only like 300b. Let me know your thoughts
Hahah god this sub. Where were you 2 months ago? Buy high baby Advanced money doubler why not just hold both?  jensen is a true visionary.   Lisa is good at operational excellence. Where were you in March/April? Like to buy high and sell low, eh? 2I have to disagree with what seems to be the popular consensus: Don't swap NVDA with AMD until AMD's fundamentals start outperforming NVDAs, which may never happen on a consistent basis. 

First, having been in the market for decades, an excellent good strategy is to buy the leader and hang on as long as they are the leader, which can last for decades. More often than not, Company A is actually ""The Next Company A."" This means you buy google, even though it is expensive, rather than Alta Vista or Go2net. This means you buy apple (back when they were growing) instead of Sprint or Cingular, thinking they will be the next apple. This means you buy AMZN and not Chewey or upstart.com. If you have 5-10% of your assets in Crypto, you buy the top-tier coins and stay away from S###coins. 

Novice investors look at the chart of the leader, see how much it has gone up, and rationalize that they missed the boat and think that maybe number 2 or 3 will outperform. Number 2 and 3 will have their prices outperform in extreme bull runs, but they will dramatically underperform as soon as the trend breaks. 

Right now, NVDA has higher margins than AMD, sequential-quarter revenue growth of 13% rather than 8%, and a far better software stack. You might think: I can buy an AMD GPU with better RAM and compute/$ and save money, for a stock, that's not the flex you think it is. All of the CUDA libraries are worth something. ROCM should work, but AMD should have started the ROCM effort as soon as NVDA started CUDA. For every dollar NVDA spends right now, NVDA makes more dollars than AMD and they have more dollars to invest in new architectures, joining more chips together, more light-based data processing, and hopefully more ASICs if NVDA wants to compete against Google and AVGO (also own both). And actually, I think google+avgo has the potential to be an NVDA killer down the road, though I don't see either company outperforming regarding fundamentals in the near term. 

For the last two years, people have been telling me that their DD has revelaed that AMD has a better forward PE than NVDA, stuff isn't being accounted for in the leading stats yada, yada. I just haven't seen it. AMD has had misses and delays. 

But, it's not like I'm not watching AMD, and as a data-driven investor I will pivot if they pull a miraculous rabbit out of their hat and start **growing faster**. I just haven't seen any rabbits yet. Sell high, buy high. AMD’s upside is just so much more realistic right now, especially with their traction in AI inference.

1mcb2zr,2025-07-29,"Microsoft in talks to continue access to OpenAI technology
Just saw a news item that Microsoft is in talks with OpenAI about continued access to the technology.

This could be a big deal for both companies, it's all about what they talk about.

Microsoft and OpenAI are in talks to continue working together to use their technology, something that could impact the next phase of the AI industry. Something to watch.

Let's be honest, Microsoft has long invested heavily in OpenAI, and with ChatGPT's integration with their Azure, it's basically become a standard solution for enterprise AI. If this time around, they're renegotiating the partnership or expanding it, it could mean:

Deeper bindings to OpenAI technology

Priority or exclusive access to future GPT releases

A possible new structure for the licensing model

A strategic moat against Google, Meta, and Amazon.

Of course, it could also mean that OpenAI is getting stronger and doesn't want to be completely dependent on Microsoft for dominance.

Would like to hear everyone's thoughts:

Is it good for Microsoft in the long run?

Will it affect OpenAI's independence or future valuation?

Are we underestimating Microsoft's current position at the heart of AI?

If you were holding Microsoft right now, would you choose to “add to your position on the low side” with this news?
I'll take the opposite view though it probably won't be popular. I don't think Microsoft should be so reliant on OpenAI. They're up the creek now, either way.

1mcazwk,2025-07-29,"(07/29) Sarepta Surges - Interesting Stocks Today
Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [Union Pacific to acquire Norfolk Southern in 85 Billion Deal](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-29/union-pacific-to-acquire-norfolk-southern-in-85-billion-deal?srnd=homepage-americas)

[**SRPT (Sarepta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SRPT&p=d)\-The FDA concluded ""the death of an 8-year-old in Brazil was unrelated to ELEVIDYS treatment and has recommended that Sarepta resume shipments for ambulatory individuals with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy"". This has caused the stock to surge afterhours yesterday. Interestingly, the stock was worth $35 before the ELEVIDYS news even happened, but we haven't resurged. So I'm a little wary of this because we haven't been going back all the way. Worth watching at the open. 

Edit: From a tweet I read, this is because ""FDA backs Sarepta's Elevidys again in ambulatory Duchenne patients but addressed none of the 3 deaths that actually triggered the agency's earlier request for a shipment pause."", so that explains why we're not all the way back yet. 

[**UNH (UnitedHealth)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d)\-UnitedHealth issued a revised 2025 adj. earnings guidance of $16 per share, below the expectations of $20.40. The company also reported Q2 adjusted EPS of $4.08 on revenue of $111.6B, missing expectations. Overall not interested in this unless we hit near lows again of $250 again, which was the max pain point from the UnitedHealth facing DOJ investigation over Medicare billing catalyst in the past. I'm not too interested in a swing trade otherwise, there are just so many different factors in this stock that I want to stay hands-off unless we have a ridiculous down day like in May.[](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/24/unitedhealthcare-doj-investigation-medicare-billing.html)

[**NVO (Novo Nordisk)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVO&p=d)\-Novo Nordisk has cut its full-year 2025 U.S. sales growth outlook to 8%-14% from 13%-21% and lowered operating profit forecast to 10%-16% from 16%-24%. Additionally, the company appointed a new CEO (Maziar Mike Doustdar) Maziar Mike Doustdar as the new CEO, effective August 7. From what I've read online, many people expected the CEO to be an American (because the main market for the weight-loss drugs is America because our obesity rate is so high). But I doubt that's a major factor in affecting stock price. We've essentially bled from 70 ->50 and had a slight bounce intraday, so I'm interested to see if we sell off again at the open/during market hours.

for all you gamblers out there, $SRPT is the play for you

their drug has always been controversial because the drug has never met its primary endpoint in its clinical trials but was fast-track approved due to patient advocacy groups influencing the previous FDA chair who swear they are seeing improvements in their children's lives from the drug

the current FDA director has voiced numerous concerns about the drug's approval before his position and it seems he is waging war against the company. there's a real possibility that the FDA may go through all the legal ways to withdraw approval for this drug. then there's also the very real possibility that the FDA loosens their stance and the drug can continue being sold and valuation multiples expand to historical levels

the company is 100% dependent on this drug being able to be sold - without it, they will go bankrupt as they were knee deep in debt and without the cash flows to sustain operations, they'll be gone in 2 years

the stock will either be zero or 4x from these levels. gambler's dream it's 50/50

1mc7l9r,2025-07-29,"Markets rose slightly after Trump announced a U.S.-EU trade deal with 15% tariffs on most European goods and a global tariff rate of 15–20%.
The broad market index’s initial moderate gains earlier in the day followed President Donald Trump’s announcement Sunday that the U.S. has struck a trade deal with the European Union, an agreement that will impose 15% tariffs on most goods imported from Europe, including automobiles. The president also said Monday that the baseline global tariff rate will be “in the range of 15 to 20%.”  
  
While investors effectively looked past the U.S.-EU trade deal, they will be watching for any other potential deals between the U.S. and other countries, such as China, to be announced by Friday’s tariff deadline. Top U.S. and Chinese officials met in Stockholm Monday for another round of trade talks. F, BGM, GM, TSLA, and HON will benefit from this as trade dynamics and tariff shifts reshape the global automotive and manufacturing sectors.  
  
Tariffs and inflation will remain a focal point throughout the week in other areas as well. The Federal Reserve is set to offer its decision on interest rates Wednesday following its two-day policy meeting. Central bank policymakers are widely expected to keep rates steady at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%
We (EU) folded too easily. Didnt even try to push it lower. Ding-ding-ding. Without a clear unified foreign policy, the EU will remain on the backfoot compared to other great powers.

Europeans like to joke about how divided the US is, but on the supranational level I'd argue the EU is just as divided, if not more. Americans getting a national sales tax through executive orders. Congrats to the land of the free with ""separation of power"". tariffs are trade barriers, and will slow down economic activity. However, market is desensitized and won't wake up until we see a dip in earnings, GDP, or employment rate. No news matter. It's just up and up. IMO European leaders simply decided fighting it isn't worth it and they're betting on a Democratic controlled Congress after the midterms. If they tried to push it lower it would drag the negotiations. Imagine second round of talks but with Orban, Meloni and every European far-right barking their little heads off in the background. 

In the current political setup EU has no negotiating power as it's never clear who is actually ruling it. yeah, nothing really matters anymore, it's just inflation.

Really, the dollar has been devalued by 10%, so the market has room to run to 10% past it's previous highs, so it probably has \~8% more to go. Really the response needs to be with trade going to free-trade friendly trading partners like Canada. Just cut the US out as middle-man and see the overall trade numbers with the US steeply decline. 

The US doesn’t really “produce” anything of value. They just buy in bulk from Canada and Mexico, maybe add some value (ie refine oil products, mill lumber from Canadian forests etc), then export. 

But I wonder if this is the overall long term goal. To alienate the states from its allies, cripple its economy and undermine their seat at the head of the global stage.

1mc4mo8,2025-07-29,"Is Google's every Tech Company bigger competitor?
I just realized that Google is typically the primary or secondary threat for almost every major tech company I can think of. 

Think about the combined market cap of the competitors, is the market undervaluing Google?

* Tesla – Waymo + Google AI
* Apple – Android + Google Search
* Microsoft – Google Workspace + Google Cloud + Google Search
* Amazon – Google Shopping + Google Cloud
* Nvidia – Google TPU
* Meta – YouTube + Google Ads + Google AI

There is one segment that Google doesn't compete in which is gaming. I'm not sure if this counts as tech because it's more so entertainment. But Microsoft and Sony are both in this realm. They never joined the console wars and I know Stadia failed. There is a segment that is widely overlooked when it comes to google. And that is the power of google maps. 

A lot of car manufacturers still use their inhouse OS, with their inhouse gps. And needless to say, compared to google OS and google maps, it’s usually always crappy. Polestar, Volvo, Ford, Honda, Renault, Nissan, GMC and a bunch of other american brands have already started using google OS in their infotainment system. 

I remember when smart phones first entered the market, every brand had their own OS. Now it’s only android and IOS. Now that a car is basically a smartphone on wheels, i suspect the same thing will happen with car OS.  Google definitely has an edge there since plenty of car manufacturers have already started using their OS and they don’t have any competitors yet. I highly suspect Apple will come to the table but they haven’t started yet. Stadia was fun while it lasted PE ratio of 19 They tried with Stadia but nobody remembers that because it flopped hard. Google was right to pivot away from it.

I think they only want to compete in a field if they can be the No. 1 or No. 2 player.

Gaming is too saturated and you can't ever grab a majority of the market. Also, look at Sony. One massive flop like Concord and they lost $400 million.

I'd like to see them try to get deeper into cybersecurity and possibly even energy. Dibs on tomorrow's turn to post ""is Google undervalued?"" Imo this should have always been the apple car project. They should made a really solid full infotainment display/software for any car manufacturer to easily integrate into any vehicle instead of trying to build an entire vehicle. This is factually incorrect for multiple reasons:
1) Google's revenue has substantially increased since the release of ChatGPT.
2) The LLMs you're using, are using Google in the background.
3) Google is the leader in AI anyways. Yes. Google is the beast amongst beasts. It is ridiculously undervalued when compared to the other Mag 7, and has way more cash to invest than others.

The reason why it is priced lower than others is mainly because it doesn't have a super hyped media platform, a scandalous CEO or huge promises that it may never achieve - it is a very ""quiet"" beast.

I believe it is the most stable across the mag7, with a constant and steady growth for years to come. Now - whether that translates to stock value... Depends on the hive mind really.

1mc1fz7,2025-07-29,"What makes Google so low?
Google consistently posts massive profits and yet its PE is around 20, which is much lower than other big tech names that sit at 40+, Tesla with a PE near 180, and PLTR up in the 600s.  
  
If we go by valuation multiples alone, Google should easily be trading above $380. What's happening?
From my understanding it’s regulation overhang, and risk to their search business being disrupted by AI. 

DOJ is set to make a hearing on chrome in the next 2 months, so might alleviate some of the sentiment regarding the business. Google narrative is that ChatGPT will continue to eat away at the search business which is the core profit center for Google. And that they will face immense antitrust pressure from govt in the next decade. 

TSLA is very disconnected from financials and is a speculative bet that they become a 10 trillion dollar company through Autonomous robots + AI  + Self driving 

Pltr is also disconnected from financials and is the market trying to price the value of deep deep government integrations like we’ve never seen before. 

Overall I think Google is the biggest smash buy out of any big tech companies. Search + GCP + YouTube give it a really high floor. Waymo + Alpha Fold + AI products + TPU give it a lot of room to grow. Ive been buying for years and keep adding more This is one major reason for the low price. The government found them guilty of being a monopoly in two different markets. And threatening to force them to sell chrome, could cost them to lose 30% of the search business. Right at the same time people will think AI will replace search, and search is the majority of their total revenue. People think chatgpt will steal Google traffic. The market is probably also punishing Google for not being on the 'forefront' of this whole gpt stuff even though they pioneered a lot of this. 

Personally, I'm long on Google and it is one of my larger positions. Relatively compared to the other tech companies, Google's PE is ridiculous. Or maybe the others are? You get the point. Who would they lose the search business to? People will use Google regardless of Chrome or any deals Just wait until the search AI's are prompted to guide your attention to preferenced results. Like a personal shopper that cuts deals with retailers. The AI replacing search is the main explanation.

If you look at Baidu (the Chinese Google), it has significantly underperformed the other Chinese stocks.

I personally think those concerns are overblown. I haven’t used Google less since ChatGPT came out. I most use ChatGPT for research and Google when I’m looking for something. ChatGPT is terrible for search as it clutter your query history( queries you want to revisit) and it takes long time to respond 
. 25 is fine for GOOGL (PE). Most of the issues are overblown. Get as much as you can in before it hits 220-240 Google is essentially an ad business based on the clicks. With Ai, you don't have to click on the website anymore and will no longer be bombarded with ads. Why use the google search bar when you can use an Ai wrapper like perplexity that will spit out the answer for you devoid of google ads. You will only have to click on sites if you really want to through the footnotes. The market is slow at realizing reality, google is building out AI under the radar while many dip shit analysts are worried about the DOJ noise that will end up being a slap on the wrist and some chump change to them. Meanwhile GCP is growing ~30%, Making cloud service deals with some of the biggest clients around. Youtube is shown as the number one streaming platform by Nielson.

1mbhncr,2025-07-28,"Trump: “China Deal Is Close” Ahead of EU and Stockholm Trade Talks  Tariffs, Semis, and Rare Earths on the Table


US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that an agreement with China was “basically” reached, although details remain unclear. His remarks came ahead of high-level talks between China and the US scheduled for Monday in Stockholm, with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and US Treasury Secretary Scott Pritzker set to lead the discussions.

Extension of the US-China tariff truce agreement (set to expire in mid-August)

U.S. pressure on China over fentanyl and oil imports from sanctioned countries

Rare earths: China's key bargaining chip; critical for electric vehicles, wind energy, and defense technology

Washington's ongoing restrictions on semiconductors related to artificial intelligence

Meanwhile, the EU has accepted a 15% tariff agreement and committed to investing $600 billion, indicating that Trump's hardline trade policy is escalating once again.

If negotiations fail, new tariffs on China's semiconductor, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical industries could take effect by the end of the third quarter.

Markets may not react strongly in the short term, but if tariffs are reimposed, this could severely impact chip manufacturers, multinational corporations, and industrial firms with business ties to China.

Monitor the following stock codes:

$ASML, $TSM, $INTC, $QCOM

$SPY, $QQQ, $FXI, $KWEB

Rare earth-related stocks: $MP, $LTHM

Disclosure: Currently do not hold any directly affected stocks. If news worsens this week, considering a protective put option strategy for $QQQ.

Feel free to share if anyone is hedging risks or seeking value investment opportunities in the U.S. supply chain.
I thought there was already a china deal latest news is if Putin does not cease fire in 10-12 days, Trump is placing secondary tariffs of 100% on countries buying Russian product ie oil. China is buying Russian Oil below market value because it helps them economically and slowly make Russia a weaker country in the long run.

  
100% tariffs, could possibly get China to make Putin stop but I would not bet on it.

PS, tariffs are product leaving China and I do not think a majority of the technology in the technology arena is leaving China. framework for discussions of a memorandum of understanding on a deal it was a ""framework"" deal My head hurts If your are the sole producer of a product that US is importing and needs, tariffs dont matter because you are not paying it and US still needs to buy it. It’s obviously an understanding of a deal that is based on the framework of previous concepts of a deal that can be changed at any minute for any reason. Fentanyl is the reason but also manufacturing and sometimes its a trade deficit. Overall it is better not to ask questions of the master business man, just accept that this is an excellent way to do business.   Im tired boss.

Tesla basically erasing its losses from an absolutely awful earnings is so fucking absurd. Google and Tesla are now both trading at roughly -2% since their Q2 earnings report. This is a sign that I don't understand anything about how the world works. Google's forward PE of 20 is clearly too high All these trade deals are awful compared to the pre-Liberation Day status quo. Low PE = no hyPE = no gainz = bad buy  
  
Ultra high PE = hyPE = GAINZ = must buy

I live in a coastal city with float plane service to the other major cities in the area. It's very convenient, downtown to downtown. Walk on and you're there in about 20 minutes.

To make this profitable, it costs about $120 one way, on a plane that takes 15-20 people. I don't know what the margins are here but I imagine not huge.

At that price, there is limited appeal. You can sometimes get standby for cheaper. Ferries are another option, or airport to airport service. So I don't know, are people suddenly going to be about paying whatever it is that Archer is going to require to be profitable, so they can sit alone?

1mbgfim,2025-07-28,"Geopolitical Alert: Trump Warns Iran Not to Restart Nuclear Program Should We Watch Oil & Gas and Military Stocks?
Trump just spoke out and warned Iran not to restart its nuclear program. While this isn't the first time US-Iran relations have been strained, given his current favorability ratings in the 2024 election, this kind of statement could trigger some reaction in the market - especially in the energy and military sectors.

 Directions to watch: 

Crude Oil (WTI / Brent): oil price volatility could increase if the situation escalates. Iran remains an important player in the Middle East.

Energy stocks (XLE, OXY, XOM, CVX): these targets may react quickly to news changes.

Military stocks (LMT, RTX, NOC): these tend to gain market attention when geopolitical tensions are high.

Gold / Silver: Precious metals may act as a short-term hedge in times of market jitters.

 Macro perspective: 

If tensions continue to escalate, this could cause markets to enter “risk aversion mode”, with short-term flows to safer assets such as the US dollar and gold.

If oil prices rise, it may also affect the market's expectations of inflation.

Open discussion: 

Have you considered geopolitical risk in your current trading strategy?

Has anyone already laid out a position in the energy/military sector?

Could this be just a political statement and not really have much impact on the market?
The EU has set August 29 as a deadline for Tehran to show progress on containing its nuclear program. If Iran fails to comply, the EU plans to reinstate UN sanctions. This could trigger an escalation around that time mainly impacting oil and gas stocks. Oh no, more of Donnie’s peace bombs! What you said makes sense, but it’s important to remember that a lot of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure has already been targeted. If the U.S. truly wanted a direct conflict, they would’ve escalated during the recent regional tensions. Instead, they chose to pause and avoid a full confrontation. That tells me we’re heading back into the cycle of pressure through sanctions and diplomacy rather than outright war. At least for now.

This is a good thread for my Beijing tea party theory:

Japan and China, combined hold sn a enormous amount of debt, having not always been the best of friends. Current administration has made them closer. Japan has outright threatened to dump treasury bonds on the open market. If he becomes too much of an asshole, China has gone from over 1 trillion to around 980 billion in T-bills since November

The most obvious choice for them to unwind their position would be the euro 

However, another complication comes into the fold, which is the oil and gas market. Considering oil is traded in the US dollar which is why China likes to keep our debt if they got mad enough to start dumping T-bills like it was Boston harbor the dollar goes through the roof gas is $12 a gallon overnight because we all know it reacts faster to the upside when there’s a crisis


Now we come to the meat and potatoes of my theory, which is basically the dark horse for where they’ve been going, as they’ve been unwinding their dollar position .

During the last administration when he began his trade war prequel, China had a little bit of a soybean crisis. They decided to replace their US soybeans with Brazilian soy beans, who, ironically is pretty much the new lead contributor to the new BRICS movement, which he hates so much I remember a few weeks ago there was a massive insider trade on the Brazilian real it was in the opposite direction of what the theory would be expecting, but it had to do with an insider Trump announcement, so it doesn’t affect the actual theory


Bonus idea : Brazil is also in the oil and gas business and if you were interested in doing a hybrid investment of the Brazilian currency and oil and gas outside of the Middle East, you could look at Petrobras(Pbr)

I think it kind of works as a hedge against the dollar or whatever the hell happens with oil and gas because it’s a bricks Ally pretty much no matter what happens Markets just went up. TACO Hopefully... I am not a friend of trading conflicts actively but as a trader I also want to avoid keeping  positions like shorts on oil on the mid term.

1mbfy79,2025-07-28,"Why Redwire Could Be One of the Most Undervalued Plays in Space, Defense, and AI Going Into 2026: $1B+ Is in Sight Sooner Than You Think
Redwire is quietly assembling the holy trinity of future tech: **Space infrastructure, AI-driven mission systems, and autonomous defense platforms**. After digging through SEC filings, DoD roadmaps, company presentations, earnings calls, RFPs and defense budget line-items, etc. I genuinely believe 2026 will be the turning point, after Edge autonomy is fully integrated and revenues finally break the $1 billion barrier.

**Here’s a breakdown by segment:**

# 1. Core Space & Commercial Contracts (~$500M+)

* **NASA, ESA, and Gateway projects**: Ongoing space infrastructure work includes solar arrays, modular structures, payload services, and ISS/Gateway support. These contracts are multiyear and locked in. → **Estimated 2026 revenue: $220M–$260M**
* **DeepSat & VLEO satellite programs**: Redwire’s AI-powered digital engineering suite (Acorn 2.0, DEMSI) is powering the next-gen Earth intelligence constellations. The commercial + defense dual-use value here is growing. → **Est. 2026: $100M–$140M**
* **Space servicing, robotics, in-orbit manufacturing (Archinaut, payload integration, etc.)**: RDW is one of the few players with actual flight heritage. → **Est. 2026: $80M–$120M**

# 2. Defense Related (Edge Autonomy) (~$200M+)

* **Edge Autonomy’s Drone platforms**: U.S. Marine Corps visit last week, partnerships, and modular drone production give Edge a key role in the drone race. → **Est. 2026**: **$180M–$250M**
* **AI payloads & systems**: Defense customers increasingly need smart, modular payloads with in-orbit/real-time data processing. RDW is already delivering.

# 3. Major Defense Initiatives (Potential Windfalls)

* **SHIELD (U.S. Missile Defense Agency – $151B IDIQ)** Redwire is a top digital integrator candidate for SHIELD, a 10-year missile defense architecture focused on AI and multi-domain ops. Redwire’s edge in model-based systems engineering and space-based sensors positions it for repeat task orders. → **Est. 2026 revenue: $130M–$250M**
* **Golden Dome / NATO Missile Defense Integration** Edge Autonomy’s modular drones and Redwire’s sensor payloads align well with NATO missile defense requirements. NATO’s expanded investment strategy (\~$100B+ in new EU-NATO air defense cooperation) increases the likelihood of Edge/Redwire tech integration. → **Est. 2026 revenue: $60M–$100M**
* **U.S. “Unleashing American Drone Dominance” Initiative (FY2026 DoD Budget: $1.01T)** The U.S. military’s sharp focus on modular Drones, smart payloads, and speed-to-field gives Edge Autonomy a prime role. Redwire’s AI-driven mission systems could scale across platforms. → **Est. 2026 revenue: $90M–$130M**
* **EU Defense & Space Surge: €131B Allocation (2028–2034)** On July 17, 2025, the European Commission proposed a €2 trillion ($2.31T) EU budget for 2028–2034. Crucially, it includes €131 billion earmarked for defense and space, a fivefold increase over current levels. Additionally, a new €451B European Competitiveness Fund will support dual-use industries like satellites and AI payloads. Redwire’s expanding European footprint and NATO linkages make it well-positioned to benefit. → **Est. 2026 revenue (early access + ramp-up): $40M–$80M**
* **Trump-EU Arms Procurement Continuity** The Trump-era U.S.–EU defense deal includes “hundreds of billions” in new EU purchases of U.S. military equipment. Redwire’s and autonomy platforms are ideal for this transatlantic arms buildup. → **Est. 2026 revenue: $30M–$60M**

# 4. Software, AI, and Classified Work (High Margin)

* **Digital Engineering Platforms (Acorn 2.0, DEMSI)** These are becoming the backbone for both satellite and defense mission planning. → **Est. 2026**: **$40M–$60M**
* **Classified payloads and integration work** Indications from filings and DoD partnerships suggest growing classified backlog. → **Est. 2026: $30M–$60M**

# 5. Strategic Assets, IP, and Non-Recurring Revenue

* **Patents & IP Licensing**: Redwire owns critical IP in 3D printing in microgravity (Archinaut), space-rated materials, digital mission engineering tools (Acorn 2.0), and autonomous systems. Licensing or IP monetization (especially in allied countries ramping defense production) could generate non-linear returns. → **Est. 2026: $20M–$40M**
* **One-off or Non-Recurring Government Grants**: Given the surge in public-private space and biotech investments (e.g., autonomous bio payloads, ISS commercialization), Redwire may secure one-time grants or milestone payments. → **Est. 2026**: **$10M–$30M**
* **Strategic JVs or Divestitures**: Redwire could form joint ventures in Europe, spin off commercial units (e.g., in-orbit manufacturing), or license key tech to allies. → **Est. 2026: $25M–$50M**

**Estimated RDW Revenue by Source for 2026**

|Source|Estimated Revenue Range (Million USD)|
|:-|:-|
|Strategic IP / Grants / Spinouts|30 – 50|
|Pharma / Autonomous Bio Projects|20 – 40|
|European ISR / Space-Based Missile Defense Support|60 – 120|

|USMC / ISR Navy Missions (Speculative)|40 – 90|
|Other Space Infra & Payloads|60 – 100|
|Commercial / LEO Missions|60 – 100|
|**Total Estimated Revenue Range**|**1,170 – 2,010** **Billion**|

**This estimated revenue is meant to capture a full range from a conservative speculation to a bullish one. If you spot anything I have overlooked, let me know. I’ll happily update it.**

|2028|$1.6B–$2.0B|6×–10×|$9.6B–$20.0B|**+319% to +773%**|

# Why This Matters

* **Q2 Earnings will show the first signs of operating leverage.**
* **Free cash flow flips positive by 2025-end**, accelerating into 2026.
* **AI + Defense + Space = Holy Trinity of Multiples**
* **Low float + high institutional interest** = re-rating catalyst
* Market cap as of today is **$2.29 billion!!!**

**If 2026 plays out as outlined, Redwire could cement itself as a foundational piece of U.S. and allied space-defense infrastructure. Redwire is quietly building the bones of a multi-decade national asset, and with execution, it could someday be worth tens or even hundreds of billions.**

**I hold 36.2k Shares, and not planning to sell until it 10x**
ChatGPT post Post a screen shot of your holdings When it runs out of money in late 2026, what it management going to do? The company just sold 16mm shares at $16.75 for $258mm. This company has a $2B enterprise value and only $166mm in assets. Operating cash flow the last 12 months was -$65mm.

How can a space ""infrastructure"" company have almost no PPE? Unbilled revenue is one of the largest assets at $43mm. 

I don't think I have ever seen something like this before. Redwire builds solar arrays for NASA’s Artemis Gateway, develops 3D printing in orbit (Archinaut), powers VLEO Earth observation satellites with AI payloads, and now delivers DoD Blue List of Approved Drones drones for defense use. The list goes on. These are highly specialized systems. But hey, if you thought this was a real estate company, I get why it all flew over your head; literally. Prompt: “Create a bullish investment thesis around the company Redwire, spelling out why it’s a strong investment in 2026 so I can unload my bags. Make sure to weave in hype from various hype-driven sectors” You better then convince your wife investing in BKSY rather than RKLB Even the way it’s formatted But post screenshot of your holdings Did you get a DM with a screen matching matching there holding?

1mb4aqt,2025-07-28,"Robinhood stock HOOD symbol, not app
I bought way too many shares of Robinhood when it ipo’ed back in 2021

I was down like 70%/80% for years and now I’m up 200%

I put a substantial amount in…like probably about 8% of my total funds

Is now the time to sell some? 

Many tech stocks like NVDA, Google, Meta, Coinbase, and others have risen a lot over the last couple years

I am somewhat new to investing so I could use people on the internet’s advice please

If you had the value of all your Robinhood stock in cash, would you dump it all into that stock?

That’s your answer. That’s a great universal rule of thumb, can’t believe I never thought about it that way Take out your original investment amount. If you belive in the future game-ification of markets, then hold it. The more people trade and gamble, then the more money hood makes.

Edit: I don't know your personal situation, but 200% is pretty sweet. Consider taking some profit and diversifying. What about the tax implications Sure if you've got something better in mind for the money, but why cut off the heads of your runners? Personally I believe Robinhood has more room to grow. Up to $250 billion market cap over the next few years, an extra 150% upside. Getting added into the S&P 500 index will help a lot but the committee is on whatever and haven’t done it yet (they’re probably loading up on it before they do that lol) The only sane advice...  Holding strong, With 19 dollars average. I would never sell! One of the most innovative company that I know. 
ALSO, they haven't got in to S&P and nasdaq100 yet. So 150Billion MC is possible :) A simple yet very effective corollary.  It took me a long time but in my fifties I feel I do this. Trades aren’t made via homing pigeon. Costs are irrelevant. The stock gave you personally nothing at all nor does it owe you anything.  I sold something recently I liked because I liked the idea of META at around $700 more. Basically I move around large positions only where I see clear better performance and ride winners pretty far.

1mb1k9p,2025-07-28,"Thoughts on Ambiq Micro (AMBQ) debuting next week
Just heard that Ambiq Micro (AMBQ) is making their IPO next week. They seem like a really good company to invest in, making low-power SoC chips and Google & Samsung being their customers. Working on a deal with Mouser Electronics that could increase their customer base. They seem to possess SPOT (Sub-threshold Power Optimized Technology) tech in their chips, which makes them power efficient. Looks like they may thrive in the AI-race??

Problem seems to be their customer base in China got cut down heavily.

They also have shown increase in Revenue and cut down on losses steadily over the years.

Can someone provide insights if this is a good stock to invest in? Planning on investing in FIGMA ($3K) & can put in $1K no this if y'all say it's promising.
I’m planning on waiting till it drops to around $38.. looks like the China tariffs haven’t fully impacted it yet. Really feel it’ll dip that low.. we’ll see. What you think? Because I read that it’s really popular, users love it, it’s UX design tool which is super important for any company that has a website. Also looks like they’ve performed pretty well Awesome thank you. I put a limit order for 25$ but I wonder what it will open at Looks like it will open at 24. I hope. We will see. Hopefully some there is  good momentum like the other semis. :) ive had my eye on it; it hit 48 when it dumped open then sort of flattened to 40; now its coming up again in the aftermarket. looks like its doing a level around 42. probably means a good day tomorrow. im already in some other stuff for tomorrow but i might try to pick some up next week and see what else it does.

did you look at celestica/cls too this week? im thinking of trying that, & maybe if it comes down a little too, maybe next week. software plays should be pretty tariff proof so im starting to think about those. right now im doing rddt earnings. It opened at 40 it seems Welcome to r/stocks!

1marvt0,2025-07-27,"Aurora Innovations (AUR) - Current front runner in autonomous trucking software and hardware



https://aurora.tech/

Looking into AUR next. Autonomous trucking hardware/software company. Summary:

    •    Cash on hand: $1.15–1.2B

    •    Burn rate: $142M/Q or $600–700M/annually

    •    Runway: ~6–7 quarters (18–22 months), assuming no change

    •    To extend this runway, Aurora must either reduce burn, raise new funds, or both before cash reserves are exhausted.


Aurora Innovation has established strategic partnerships with several leading companies to advance the development and deployment of its self-driving technology, particularly for autonomous trucks. Key partnerships include those with Nvidia and Continental, focusing on both the software and hardware aspects of autonomous driving systems. Other significant collaborations involve companies like Uber Freight, FedEx, Hirschbach Motor Lines, PACCAR, Ryder, Schneider, and Volvo, reflecting a broad ecosystem approach to commercializing autonomous trucking. 


Aurora Innovation (AUR) was co-founded by Chris Urmson, the former chief technology officer of Google/Alphabet Inc.'s self-driving team, which became known as Waymo, as well as by Sterling Anderson, former head of Tesla Autopilot, and Drew Bagnell, former head of Uber's autonomy and perception team.

They are already doing test runs between Houston and Dallas, and just started a run between El Paso and Phoenix (a 1000 mile, 14 hour run that currently cannot legally be done by a single human driver in a day due to a max of 11 hours driving time allowed). This is part of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's (FMCSA) Hours of Service (HOS) regulations. The 11 hours of driving must be taken within a 14-consecutive-hour period, after at least 10 consecutive hours off duty. 

This is a huge advantage of autonomous trucks, they can operate 24 hours a day with no breaks legally required. 

So they have a huge runway right now for cash on hand compared to cash burn, they seem to be one of the leaders compared to Waymo (Waymo stopped doing trucking and focused solely on cab company)

A couple other speculative competitors but the closest is a privately owned company so can’t invest in it anyway. My guess is there is no winner take all for self driving and most likely a competition based future until one rockets to the front of the pack by being head and shoulders above the others…Which could be 5-10 years from now, but plenty of money to be made between now and then. Google and AUR are the best bets. 

Multi year hold for real gains, could still easily see a 100% gain in the next 0.5-2 years. Potential 10x by 2030.  

Aur at $11b market cap today, Waymo is like $45b right now. 
Most analysts have it valued at $10 a share. 
 
No debt and $1b cash on hand is really nice. 

Holding 3000 shares and $4000 worth of Jan 2026 $10 calls and $10-$15 2027 leaps.

This is on sale right now due to Uber (\~86 million shares, \~22–26% of Aurora) issued $1 billion of exchangeable senior notes (with an over-allotment option up to $150 million), due in 2028, right after AUR hit feature complete.

Personally I think the stock is momentarily depressed due to this, and see the price bouncing back already now that that shock is over. Uber still holds the shares but essentially sold a giant call option as backing for a massive loan.

Fundamentals are very good, the technology is safety driven and the domain is constrained (Well mapped, federal interstates, sunbelt, favorable regulatory climates, expensive best in class sensor suites attached to already expensive trucking rigs, a virtual software testing harness, and point to point deliveries between shipping hubs.) Their operations center is a scalable subscription service, While disrupting human drivers, insurance and unlocking 24/7 trucking has clear ROI. I see deep value here and bought a significant amount of LEAPs.

  
I cannot understand why so much of the focus here has been on L4 autonomy displacing cheap plentiful uber drivers with affordable insurance on some of the most complex city streets and parking lots in infinitely untestable surfaces, all to realize a 20$ cab fare + tip? 

Safe qualified truck drivers are perpetually in shortage, expensive, expensive to insure, and drive expensive equipment that sits idle due to driving hour maximums - while driving in a boring predictable tedious domain that machines excel at, especially as a fleet. ""Follow the speed limit exactly, maintain safe following distances, constantly check every blind spot"" all while disruptions to JIT delivery has outsized financial risk to business. Where do you think more funding might come from? I’m gonna steal this comment for the wsb post. Got any other articles or anything else to add for a bigger dd post? Likely dilutive, but not necessary at the moment with over $1b cash on hand. New partnerships could provide additional funding as well. If ya want to do that it's fine. I put what I wrote though the AI grinder to clean up what I wrote on my phone.



⸻

This stock is presently on sale due to a technical, non-fundamental dislocation: Uber (~86 million shares, ~22–26% of Aurora) issued $1 billion in exchangeable senior notes (with a $150 million over-allotment option), due in 2028, just after Aurora declared its autonomy stack “feature complete.” The market misread this financing structure—essentially Uber selling a large call option on its Aurora stake to collateralize a zero-coupon loan—as a bearish signal rather than a liquidity optimization. Uber still holds the equity and has not exited; the price drop reflects anticipatory dilution, not a deterioration in fundamentals. That shock appears absorbed, and the stock has begun to rebound.

Fundamentally, Aurora is a high-conviction industrial AI play. Its L4 autonomy system is built not for chaotic urban passenger rides but for a constrained, well-mapped, high-value domain: U.S. interstate freight corridors in favorable regulatory jurisdictions. This is where autonomy actually works—limited edge-case volatility, point-to-point logistics between shipping hubs, and standardized driving behaviors that reward rule-following machines. The sensor suite is expensive, but it’s deployed on already expensive semi rigs where marginal cost is amortized efficiently. Their virtual software harness accelerates validation, and their operations center provides a scalable, subscription-like service model—monetizing autonomy as infrastructure, not as gadgetry.

The economic thesis is equally strong. Unlike the labor-abundant urban ridehail sector—where the average driver is underpaid, overregulated, and insurable at low cost—the long-haul freight sector is short on safe, qualified drivers, who are expensive to employ, costly to insure, and legally capped in hours. Meanwhile, trucks costing $500k–$1M often sit idle. Autonomous freight eliminates these bottlenecks. Machines don’t fatigue. They follow the rules precisely—maintain distance, check blind spots, obey speed limits—and deliver continuous 24/7 uptime with compounding ROI. In logistics, where missed JIT windows can cripple a supply chain, this kind of reliability and throughput is not just preferable, it’s transformational.

That the AV sector has disproportionately focused on displacing immigrant cab drivers for $20 ride fares—via cut-rate sensors bolted to compact sedans navigating infinitely variable urban surfaces—is strategically baffling. Freight autonomy is not only more technically viable; it is economically inevitable. Aurora has the partnerships, the domain alignment, and the execution pathway to dominate this wedge. I’ve taken a significant LEAP position to reflect that belief.

⸻ do you have any analysis that backs this up? 20x seems high to me, but we will know within a couple of years for sure, once we see the growth rate Agreed. I have a few hundred shares but I'm debating whether to wait until the potential dilutive event to buy more. Aurora is a no brainer buy and hold. Easily a 20 bagger within 5 years.

1ma7muc,2025-07-26,"I have a problem
Hello everyone,

I have been investing in the stock market for 5 years, I started at the beginning of 2021.

I was doing moderately well, but invested a big amount of my portfolio in a company that eventually went bankrupt. Since then, I’ve thankfully been more careful and not repeated the same mistake.

Here’s my issue, I’ll find a stock that seems to have a great investment thesis behind it (say GOOGL for example) but I’ll take a look at their chart and see that just 4 months ago, GOOGL was at $140s (now in the $190s) and as a result, I’ll immediately put it aside and wait for a pull back as it has already gone up 30% in 4 months, despite the fact that GOOGL’s is still almost flat since last year.

Likewise, when a company is at a complete all time low, I’ll say that it could always get worse and leave it! A good example - I saw EL back at the beginning of April, just after Michael Burry announced he sold off pretty much all his US equities and loaded up on EL. I saw the huge drop after their earnings and said “look at that, Burry bought but even still it isn’t the time to buy” - EL is up almost 90% since then. Even right now, EL is down 10% since last year, but I still won’t touch it because it’s already up 90% from its deep low.

I’m not sure if it’s just me that struggles with it, or if there are others here that do the same, but it feels like I keep missing out on large opportunities because I keep trying to time things tightly. I’m curious if anyone had any insight.

Thanks in advance.
You need to accept that you will miss out on many large opportunities. Last week particularly, I missed out on a massive amount of gain. But I accept this is a part of how it goes sometimes and move on. If you get upset about it then you will become emotional and act irrational. You need to be more objective about valuations and and stick to solid companies. If you feel like you cant fix this problem just stick to index funds. It helps to recognize the large losses that you miss out on by not acting. There’s lots of times I considered a stock and then later realized it would have been a terrible idea  Do you realize the vast majority of people picking stocks (even the professionals) fail to best the market over the long term? So invest index ETFs and get better results. If you enjoy picking stocks set aside a small part of your portfolio for that. Let’s think logically for a moment. A stock that you want to buy and hold for a long time, presumably, SHOULD be making all-time highs a lot. If it’s not, it means the stock isn’t growing.

The best time to buy a such a stock is yesterday. The next best time is today. Good stocks are like that, they are rarely discounted how you want it. Valuations seem to almost mean nothing these days. The market has been acting nonsensical since Covid. All signs point to recession but stocks keep climbing higher. Think of what other countries view the us markets as these days. Corrupt and manipulated. If a big crash does not happen in the next two years (a typical correction) there’s no denying we DO NOT HAVE A FREE AND FAIR MARKET. Price discovery is a lie and hedge funds keep letting prices rise on illicit and naked options activity. The main reason for them to do this is they need higher collateral to keep the bottom from falling out on their bad bets. Look at unrealized losses in the banking and prime broker category. Buffet went to high percentage of cash before retirement, the sahm indicator has been flashing. We have had an inverted yield curve all of 2025. None of it makes sense. A good play 5 years ago is a bad play now. A bad play now turns out to be a good one. I have lost all faith in the fed and our us markets and those that regulate (or so they say) them. It’s a giant ball of shit wrapped in dog shit and our pensions will suffer the largest brunt of it right along side retail investors. There is no regulation or punishment for those that made bad bets with other people’s money. We are their exit liquidity and just seem too stupid to realize it. Sorry for the doom and gloom but look it all up. We are one US interest  rate cut and one Japan rate hike away from closing the gap on the carry trade and the entire house of cards will fall. I’m sitting on 75 percent cash waiting for the crash of all crashes like buffet and I’ll buy cheap and make my gains in the next two decades. That is if the dollar survives. Good luck just my 2 cents Sometimes it helps to put it all out there, kind of bounce it off other people This people.  90% of professional money managers cannot beat the S&P 500 over a 10yr period.  Kathy Woods can’t do it to save her life.  Don’t think you can, you likely can’t and there’s nothing wrong with that because you can buy a comprehensive etf or mf and beat most managers.  It’s not as sexy as hitting a runner like PLTR but the end game will still be good. Don't invest in a stock based on the chart. Invest in a thesis. If no thesis is present, invest in indexes. Don’t look for the large opportunities, but focus on consistent contributions and investments.

1ma7los,2025-07-26,"SPY bears will get a reprieve from the pain. But they'd be wise to jump on the bull side.
We currently have a market that is pricing in a goldilocks regime (inflation down, growth up). We have growth expectations historically low. Recession level low. That is not when corrections happen, so the market is correct in its growth pricing. Growth will slow but not to the level consensus believes it will. With regards to inflation, consensus already has rising inflation cooked into the books, so there will not be upside surprises on the inflation front. So upside surprises on the growth front alongside 0 surprises on the inflation front means a risk on environment. 

However, the number of asset classes and style factors pricing in goldilocks is approaching the 10 year trailing average. We cant price in growth up, inflation down forever. I believe the market is correct in pricing growth up. Upside surprises are to come on the growth front. But why are we pricing in inflation down? On a 1-3 month basis, the market is likely to price in a rise in inflation. Not just because of the qualitative reasoning (dollar down, tarriffs inflationary, growth up inflationary)  but mostly because of the quantitative reasoning explained above. 

We are likely headed into a reflationary regime. Stagflation is possible but not probable. Deflation is nearly impossible. Stopping fighting it. Don't swim upstream. Just buy pullbacks in SPY. 
Inflation is priced in, and that's why Walmart is trading at a PE of 50 I think we will see corrections soon, I have been buying some long puts as hedges whenever the market is up eg on earnings day I think the real surprise for you and many others will be stagflation. Have fun and make gains now and we'll deal with the rest later Nobody does great in stagflation Feels like you have your own political bias when you say this Valuations are getting absurd again though. I'm wary of another july 22-august 5 type of event when the first half year's growth was so priced in that none of the mags could match the expensive valuations they grew into at the Q2 earnings. MSFT tanked, Nvidia tanked (shocking everyone that was big on the AI hype train) and we started getting all those 'Is all this capex warranted"" jitters around AI that made so many people scream ""BUBBLE""

Not to mention Deepseek. 

When a disruptive piece of news hits, the market can tank, and it can tank HARD if it's all priced for perfection. That's the problem when you price in a smooth winds ahead scenario. Any kind of news that breaks apart the optimism of a hefty bull run can result in a correction. 

I personally think we'll correct before we push any more upwards. yeah unfortunately for us (I'm not even from the US) we have to pay attention to Donnie's endless ramblings if we are to successfully navigate the markets during his term. He's unrelentingly vocal, it makes the game harder than it needs to be imo. retail has been buying the entire rally and the short term bull trade was based around bitcoin and mag 7 capex. those two things caused the ATH. now we are entering earnings season where we will see there isn't much substance to the rally, but it may still take a few weeks for that to materialize. QQQ likely to lead a nice squeeze as shorts try to time the top and then the profit taking will hit hard Close then NOW and don't do that again.

1ma6h5j,2025-07-26,"Stocks which will benefit the most if Trump’s Tariff actions are ruled to be illegal…
The US Court of Appeals will hear oral arguments regarding the legality of Trump’s tariff actions on July 31, 2025. A decision within weeks is expected thereafter, and likely further appeal to the US Supreme Court. If the Court upholds Trump’s actions, it seems to be a status quo event. But if it is ruled that the President does NOT legally have such authority, the impact might be very significant for many companies.   
In that event, which stocks would you expect to benefit the most?   
I own AAPL and assume that it would react positively. Which others would you be looking for to rise strongly on such news (if it happens.) ?
I wouldn’t hold my breath waiting for Trump to be held accountable. I doubt the SC will go against Trump, but if they did say the tariffs were not legal you could see GM pop, they just reported Q2 numbers that showed over $1B hit to operating income directly because of tariffs The U.S. dollar lol Even more relevant, the court of appeals decision isn't likely to change anything in the near term and SCOTUS won't start hearing arguments until October.  They won't issue a ruling until next year.

Nothing is changing soon. Limpdick’s investment firm Cantor is buying tariff debt from small and medium sized businesses with the understanding they will be ruled illegal. pretty fucking telling of what he thinks will happen at least. Nike. The businesses will be owed that money back from the government. So he is buying it at a discount  such that he gets the spread.  💯

Fuck that guy and may every door hit him on the ass on the way out, but anyone thinking he won’t avoid every single bad thing he should suffer is just deluding themselves. He made a deal with the devil and we all have to pay the bill. If they are ruled to be illegal, I think the entire market will rally lol Yes exactly, they are giving small and medium sized businesses loans to cover a certain percentage of the tariffs paid (since most literally can not afford to pay them in totality without going under).

Wthout a Trump presidency we almost certainly would have had no tariff onslaught and lower interest rates by now. This is amazing: one by one, Trump is securing a tax cut for foreigners while imposing a tax hike on Americans and calling it a win! Bullish my ex-US ETFs which are up bigly this year. Literally everything else he does Brace yourselves.  Video evidence on X that Trump cheats at golf.

And he is normally a man of such high character. I don't understand bears.  We are literally printing money, and they just want to whine about how unfair it is that the market just goes up.

If you can't even find the will to buy shares or leaps, then you should just take your cash and buy CDs or a savings account. i mean, you gotta think about the long term consequences, and things like political stability.

all of these are quite important and not extremist at all. Dollar surge on the back of EU bending over for the US.

Trump won. part of it is people mixing politics and investing. I dislike the party in power and want them to fail, but I'd be a fool to bet against US corporations doing well in this environment. Inflation being high under Biden is what lost the Dems the election. That's not a guess, it came out of pre-election and exit polls.

The price of goods cuts through all political noise. We'll see how this goes when companies start passing on the cost increases to consumers, which they entirely did in 2018.

1m9kcri,2025-07-26,"What are we investing in during these crazy times?
So in April when stock prices were down, I scraped up all the cash I could and added more of what currently hold. Since I’ve been just saving up to have some cash on hand and now I’m ready to put more money in the market but like everyone I’m concerned the bubble will burst soon but don’t want to sit and wait so I am curious what is everyone buying during these crazy times? I just added some more WM this week and some GOOGL a couple weeks ago. Thanks

EDIT. A few people tell me to DCA or VOO and chill. I get it but in just not here for that. I’ve invested in real estate for 20 years and 3-4 years ago got into stocks to diversify and because it’s interesting. I’m enjoying the conversation and interesting suggestions here. I’ll be reading and learning about your suggestions. Thank you. 
Just DCA till the end of eternity Space and AI. Full port AMD Yes, it will definitely go up or down I think ASML is the biggest steal in the market right now DCA into an index fund and move on with your life.

I feel like people think Trump is waffling, until a day comes that he actually doesn't. Most investors are extremely greedy at the moment, too greedy for the current world-economic situation.

Well, personally I rotated some of my profits to the less volatile part of my portfolio (consumer staples, finance, telecom), keep DCA'ing and got a big pile of cash ready for the next big correction to put into my more, currently overpriced innovative part of my portfolio.

Lately, I’ve been monitoring LCID closely and I am wondering what’s the consensus here. Regardless of melon, I think TSLA is the king in EV market. However, I think LCID has a niche to eat up the market share from TSLA. Yes, they are not profitable and the stock has been going south since its IPO.

1m90m39,2025-07-25,"$1B in Nvidia AI chips smuggled to China despite Trump export controls  What does this mean for NVDA investors?
 Long NVDA (starter position \~5% portfolio), no options.  
Looking to scale in further but watching policy risk closely.

News broke today (July 25) that **over $1B worth of high-end Nvidia AI chips** (like H100, A100) were illegally routed into **China** despite recent U.S. export controls imposed under Trump’s administration.

According to the report, the chips were funneled via third-party channels through Southeast Asia and the Middle East, bypassing official trade restrictions. Some units were reportedly selling for **$50,000+** due to scarcity. This happened **within just three months** of the new restrictions.
Means someone's buying billions of chips It means China **desperately needs** more Nvidia chips

It's now widely recognized that DeepSeek **lied** about hardware resources in their technical paper from January, and that Dylan Patel of SemiAnalysis was correct

Looking ahead, Inference, Reasoning models, Multi-Agent systems, and Test-Time Compute all require hell lot more compute, not less Sounds like only good news, somebody paid for those chips Bullish Low effort post is what it means. I was laughing for weeks at the deepseek reaction - first, it was old news, and second, the market reaction was literally just wrong.

Between that and April, fantastic buying opportunities for people with brains. Exactly, Nvidia made a profit on it. It says the demand is so high there’s a black market for their chips, buy and hodl! No link/source?

Each rack weighs like 2500-3500 lbs. Each rack costs somewhere between $2-7m depending on what you're getting.

If we assume at low end of the scales, you're telling us that someone smuggled in 400 RACKS worth of product/ 1 million pounds / 500 TONS? It means regardless of where they are going.

1m8zvus,2025-07-25,"AMD positions itself in the inference segment, expecting the total addressable market (TAM) for inference to be larger than that of training
ZF Su has done a remarkable job at AMD, taking it from a struggling company to a company that now has a market capitalization that surpasses Intel's and is well ahead of NVIDIA's. This is not the first time that AMD has been at a disadvantage. This isn't the first time AMD has been at a disadvantage, and it's highly unlikely that AMD will overtake NVIDIA in market capitalization in the next few years, but the gap is certainly closing. Over the past year, AMD has been dubbed a “senior money destroyer” by investors as Wall Street analysts' price targets have fallen along with AMD's stock price, but that's now reversing. Market optimism, AMD's win over NVIDIA in AI inference, its partnership with the Middle East, and OpenAI's favoring of AMD GPUs have led to a rebound in the stock and Wall Street has raised its price target. Global investment in AI infrastructure is only going to increase, with McKinsey estimating that by 2030 the figure will be as high as $7 trillion. AI reasoning is essential during this tech boom. If AMD introduces a better product for this specific element in its GPUs, AMD will significantly close the gap as customers will want AMD GPUs for inference rather than training.

AMD is positioning itself for the future in the inference space rather than competing with NVIDIA in the training space now. The improvements they proposed in their recent AI keynote, as well as OpenAI's adoption of the MI400X, are very optimistic for AMD as growth soars with the lifting of restrictions in China.
Word salad I’m a huge AMD guy but this was a whole lot of nothing words Dude never heard of paragraphs Market capitalization ahead of Nvidia? WTF is this slop? The issue is they still need to catch up in inference market share too lol.


Hard to be bullish on a company that came to understand the importance of what was to come so late in the game, not to mention having an extremely deep r&d deficit compared to their peers. That was pretty pathetic dude This post gives me hope. If people that type paragraphs like this play in the stock market of course I can make money in the stock market too. That's because you haven't used AMD inference to understand it. AMD is prob one of the best plays in the market today, it was absolutely the best play in the market when it traded 100-140.

Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

[**UNH (UnitedHealth)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d)\- UNH confirmed it is under both civil and criminal investigation by the DOJ over Medicare Advantage billing practices. The probe centers on allegations that the company inflated patient diagnoses to secure higher federal payments. Stock sold off 5% yesterday, then sold off even more this morning but recovered. I'm mainly interested in the short side on this and not interested in the long unless we do something crazy like go back down to $250.

[**SRPT (Sarepta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SRPT&p=d)\- Safety officials indicated that SRPT could modify dosing or manufacturing processes and conduct additional tests to address liver-related issues associated with its gene therapy, Elevidys. This follows reports of serious liver injuries, including fatalities, linked to the treatment and potentially turning it into a black box treatment. This has been run down from 30 -> 10.50 in the past few days and touched 10.50 again premarket. IMO the market hasn't been too impressed by this news but still waiting to see if we break 10.50 lows again. 

[**INTC (Intel)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTC&p=d)\- Reported earnings yesterday, EPS of -$0.10 vs $0.01 expected. Revenue of $12.8B vs $11.8B expected. INTC announced a 15% workforce reduction, an $800M impairment, $200M in one-time Q2 costs, and canceled planned projects in Germany and Poland while slowing construction in Ohio. Overall bad earnings for INTC, not too interested in playing a bounce in this, more interested in taking the short side if momentum continues.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- EPS and revenue both missed expectations, with auto revenue falling 16% YoY to $16.6B and total revenue dropping 12% to $22.4B. CEO Elon Musk warned of ""a few rough quarters"" ahead amid rising tariffs and expiring federal EV tax credits. I was specifically interested in $301/300 yesterday, today I'm interested in seeing if it sells off again.

1m8ys3z,2025-07-25,"Trump expresses support for Musk's development  what does this mean for Tesla and subsidy-related stocks?
Trump recently posted a message clearly stating that he has no plans to cut Musk's government subsidies, despite recent rumors that he would target electric vehicle subsidies once in office. He specifically said he hopes Musk and all American companies can achieve “unprecedented prosperity.”

Why is this significant?

TSLA has already risen by approximately 12% in July, breaking through the $180-$190 range and approaching the resistance level near $240.

Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) continues to support electric vehicle tax credits and renewable energy subsidies  and the market had already partially factored in the expectation that “if Trump were elected, subsidies might be terminated.”

However, if Trump now states that he is willing to retain these subsidies at least for Musk that would be a clear positive for TSLA bulls.

This could also impact solar, battery, and charging infrastructure stocks like $ENPH, $FSLR, and $CHPT.

My brief observation:

Companies reliant on subsidies may face lower political risks, especially as the election season approaches.

Trump is intentionally distinguishing Musk and other “woke” renewable energy companies, courting Musk while avoiding angering his supporters.

The market fears uncertainty this statement at least provides some direction.

My view:  

I've been gradually reducing my TSLA holdings over the past few months, but to be honest, after reading this statement, I'm tempted to buy more during a pullback. If both parties support electric vehicles (even if their motives differ), that removes a major downside risk.  

I'll also continue to monitor $RIVN and $LCID, though they're less reliant on subsidies than TSLA, they could still follow the trend and rise.

What do you think?  

Do you still hold TSLA?  

Is this just campaign rhetoric, or is the policy direction truly shifting?  

Has anyone positioned themselves for this trend through options or electric vehicle ETFs (such as $IDRV or $LIT)?
Yeah well the subsidies are being cut. He signed the fucking law that does that. FTA:

>TSLA has already risen by approximately 12% in July, breaking through the $180-$190 range and approaching the resistance level near $240.

what currency are you talking about? TSLA hasn't been below $280 since late april in usd. Was looking for this comment, I feel like he just GPTed this whole thing and it messed up the share price I mean it only takes one argument to really mess up this relationship. Elon and trump both have huge egos. Fallouts could happen easily. Trump also said he had no plans to fire Jerome Powell. Yet he is throwing every trick there is to get him to resign.

Trump’s words are as valuable than Elon’s ""Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) continues to support electric vehicle tax credits and renewable energy subsidies and the market had already partially factored in the expectation that “if Trump were elected, subsidies might be terminated.”

Oh, is that why the stock raced straight up after Trump was elected?  Because they were factoring in the subsidies being terminated?

This stock only started to really go down once Musk was involved with the government.  If you think all the bad news has been factored into its price, you're crazy.  This stock doesn't trade on any of that, it's purely vibes. Came looking for this too - 1000% GPTed with no proofread lol. Even the talking points are stale trump say a lot of shit.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Not gonna lie.  Powell has bigger balls than most.

The most powerful man on earth comes to your place of work to attempt to physically and publicly intimidate you, and you basically tell him to F off, on camera.

I almost forgive him for the whole ""inflation is transitory"" screw up. Conservatively you can guarantee 40% average yearly returns on SPY because it increases .5% nearly every day. Be greedy when others are greedy Why did you fart in the waymo? There are so many people whining about the market rocketing skyward.  Why not just buy leaps and join the party? Its also a huge contradiction to claim that the economy is amazing but that we also desperately need rate cuts. I get that its more for our debt but then maybe those tax cuts would be a great place to start for dealing with that 700 P/E looks reasonable Guys I'm starting to think this isn't a dead cat bounce...

I have been doing a ton of research over the past few weeks as to what portfolio I can dumb money in long term while going to sleep at night and I wanted to share my outcome so far with you all. Please give me your honest opinion. The goal of my research was to create a portfolio that has a piece of major sectors so that it grows well over time but also provides income. I chose 5 areas to focus both on growth and income. Those areas are S&P, Technology ETF, Real Estate, Bitcoin, Gold. The income is the ETFs that sells options on those 5 by NEOS.

Here is my portfolio result so far:

• 50% Growth: 

VOO - S&P500 

VGT - Technology 

VNQ - Real Estate 

MSTR - Bitcoin 

AAAU - Gold



• 50% Income: 

SPYI - Monthly Options Income On S&P 

QQQI - Monthly Options Income On QQQ 

BTCI - Monthly Options Income On Bitcoin 

IYRI - Monthly Options Income On Gold 

IAUI - Monthly Options Income On Real Estate

This portfolio gained 32% this year and provides 8.5% a year income distributed monthly.

My logic is that this gives exposure to main areas of the market, hedges against inflation, protects capital by capital appreciation, and gives monthly income based on all the underlying.

Advice? Thoughts?
I searched a bunch of those tickers and most are flat for this year. Am I missing something about your %32 gains this year? Can't buy Bitcoin in tax free accounts, as far as I know of. Why would you buy MSTR rather than just buying bitcoin? dont mind the downvotes from FOMO crowd. They were predicting doomsday in april. you are right, other than tech, economy is struggling, too much tech You know wrong Beat my 32% YTD, great work Hopefully you can place a large chunk of it into a pre- taxed Roth. As you gain money, you’ll never pay taxed on it again. You should probably register this portfolio as an ETF so we can track how badly it will underperform the SP500. What exactly are you trying to do? Underperform the SP500? Why not stick to it? Nice like the monthly gold option.

1m8f6fe,2025-07-24,"Intel beats on revenue, issues better-than-expected forecast
Intel reported second-quarter results on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations on revenue, as the company’s new CEO Lip-Bu Tan announced significant cuts in chip factory construction. The stock ticked higher in extended trading.

Here’s how the chipmaker did versus LSEG consensus estimates:

* **Earnings per share**: Loss of 10 cents per share, adjusted.
* **Revenue**: $12.6 billion versus $11.92 billion estimated

Intel said it expects revenue for the third-quarter of $13.1 billion at the midpoint of its range, versus the average analyst estimate of $12.65 billion. The chipmaker said that it expects to break even on earnings while analysts were looking for earnings of 4 cents per share.

For the second quarter, Intel reported a net loss of $2.9 billion, or 67 cents per share, compared with a $1.61 billion net loss, or 38 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. Earnings per share were not comparable to analyst estimates due to an $800 million impairment charge, “related to excess tools with no identified re-use,” the company said. That resulted in an EPS adjustment of about 20 cents.

The report was Intel’s second since Lip-Bu Tan took over as CEO in March, promising to make the chipmaker’s products competitive again, and to reduce bureaucracy and layers of management, including slashing staff in Oregon and California.

In a memo to employees published on Thursday, Tan said that the first few months of his tenure had “not been easy.” He said that the company had “completed the majority” of its planned layoffs, amounting to 15% of the workforce, and that it plans to end the year with 75,000 employees. Intel previously said it was trying to reduce operating expenses by $17 billion in 2025.

Intel shares are up about 13% this year as of Thursday’s close after plummeting 60% in 2024, their worst year on record.

Tan also announced several other spending cuts in the memo, particularly in the company’s costly foundry division, which makes chips for other companies and is still looking for a big customer to anchor the business.

Intel said its foundry business had an operating loss of $3.17 billion on $4.4 billion in revenue.

Tan said that Intel had cancelled planned fab projects in Germany and Poland, and will consolidate its testing and assembly operations in Vietnam and Malaysia. He added that the company would slow down the pace of its construction of a cutting-edge chip factory in Ohio, depending on market demand and if it can secure big customers for the facility.

“Over the past several years, the company invested too much, too soon – without adequate demand,” Tan wrote. “In the process, our factory footprint became needlessly fragmented and underutilized.”

Tan wrote that the company’s forthcoming chip manufacturing process, called 14A, will be built out based on confirmed customer commitments.

“There are no more blank checks. Every investment must make economic sense,” Tan wrote.

The company’s client computing group, which is primarily comprised of sales of central processors for PCs, had $7.9 billion in sales, down 3% on an annual basis.

Revenue in the data center group, which includes some AI chips but is mostly central processors for servers, rose 4% to $3.9 billion. Tan wrote in his memo that Intel wants to regain market share in data center chips, and is looking for a permanent leader for the business. Longtime rival Advanced Micro Devices has increasingly been winning server business from cloud customers.

Tan added he would personally review and approve all chip designs before they are taped out, which is the final step of the design process before a new chip is manufactured.

1m8dtml,2025-07-24,"Quantum Space A High Risk / High Reward Play
**Quantum Scape (QS) $12.50**

**Industry/Sector/Type – – – Solid State Batteries / Breakthrough in Battery Technology/High Risk / High Reward**

**Biggest catalyst for the stock:** Possibly achieving commercialization with Volkswagen in the next few years, after a successful milestone completion.

**Positives**

QS is one of the leaders in next-generation solid-state lithium-metal battery technology, partnering with PowerCo, a subsidiary of Volkswagen. PowerCo handles production, while QS licenses the technology – an asset-light approach.

Major milestone in production scale-up with the successful integration of its advanced Cobra separator process into baseline cell production in June 2025.

25X improvement over the prior generation process, essential for gigafactory scalable production.

Two royalty payments of $130Mn and $131Mn – one assured on reaching the first milestone in 2025, and the second starting from 2026.

The expanded deal with VW is a huge sign of confidence.

PowerCo can license this technology to non-VW customers, opening up a new market.

QS has enough funding through 2029 with the expanded deal with VW.

Quantum Space announced another automotive OEM Joint Venture on its earnings call on July 23rd, but didn’t disclose the name.

**Negatives**

Several challenges remain; this is still a long way from market commercialization at an affordable price, which is extremely difficult; thus, all revenue forecasts will be more like “guesstimates”.

Competition: BMW and Ford are backing competitor Solid Power, and Stellantis and Mercedes are backing Factorial Energy.

It already has a $7Bn market cap, with the first significant revenue beyond milestone payments expected only after 2027-2028.

The stock has jumped 60% in the past year, with the biggest increase from $4.30 in June (after the COBRA announcement) to a high of $15 last week, from where it has dropped 20%. Given the massive run-up up it could still have room to drop.

I **bought 10% of my planned target this morning, around $12.60, and will accumulate on declines.**

This is a 5-year buy-and-hold high-risk/high-reward play on a promising, groundbreaking technology.
*Quantum**Scape** I stopped reading as soon as he got the name wrong. I stopped reading at Volkswagen I plan on splitting some money between QS and Solid Power tomorrow. I would buy Factorial but they're private.

edit: my dick is in orbit What's wrong with Volkswagen?

They own Porsche, Lamborghini, Audi, Bentley, and others. 

They sell like 7 million cars a year. What makes them a poor partner? A company called Quantam Space would soar though. This stock could play a similar role that Nvidia plays in the chip industry. Being first for commercial SSBs, is going to flush out a lot of competitors. My favorite statement on QS.

I do not believe SSB will ever be fully commercially available due to technical issues.   Semi- solid yes, but not true SS
    
I particularly like this comment from Fastmarkets. 
 
Negative sentiment has been exacerbated by Western leaders like VW-backed Quantumscape delaying their product offerings and shifting timelines following persistent technological problems, so the industry feels increasingly Sisyphean despite progress continuing to be made,&quot; Connor Watts, battery raw materials analyst at Fastmarkets, told CNBC by email. 
 
Derived from Greek mythology, a so-called &quot;Sisyphean&quot; undertaking refers to an endless and futile task. VW views electrification, and batteries in particular, as their competitive advantage going into the future. 

They view the battery as just as important as the internal combustion engine. 

They've spun up and invested billions in PowerCo, their internal battery development subsidiary.

I could see them flexing production of EVs based on demand, but this really is a secular bet for them. They truly believe this is what will set them apart heading into the future.

1m8c91z,2025-07-24,"Tesla’s stock plunges 9% after another weak quarter for auto sales
Tesla shares fell 9% Thursday after the company reported a second straight quarter of declining auto sales, and CEO Elon Musk told analysts that there could be a “few rough quarters” ahead due to the expiration of federal electric vehicle tax credits.

Musk’s EV maker reported a 16% decline in automotive revenue from a year earlier to $16.7 billion. Total revenue fell 12% to $22.5 billion from $25.5 billion a year earlier, missing the average analyst estimate of $22.74 billion, according to LSEG.

Tesla has been facing rising competition in key markets like China and Europe, especially from lower cost Chinese EV players. In early July, Tesla reported a 14% year-over-year slide in vehicle deliveries to 384,000 for the second quarter. 

And in Europe, Tesla’s new car registrations declined last month, according to data released Thursday from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association.

Tesla shares have been hammered this year, with the stock down 25% in 2025, by far the worst performer among tech’s megacaps.

On Wednesday’s earnings call, Musk and CFO Vaibhav Taneja said that the “big beautiful bill” recently passed by Congress would affect Tesla’s business. The bill ends a federal $7,500 EV tax credit at the end of September.

Along with the struggles in Tesla’s core auto business, Musk’s own political activity has been in focus. 

The world’s richest person led President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), slashing the size of the federal government and regulatory agencies that oversee his companies. He also endorsed Germany’s extreme anti-immigrant AfD party.

In recent months, Musk and Trump have clashed over the president’s spending bill, and Musk recently said he’s forming his own political party.

Tesla investors have been eagerly waiting for the company to release a cheaper EV model to refresh the aging lineup and perhaps reinvigorate sales. Tesla management said it started limited production of the more affordable model in June and expects to ramp it up in the second half of the year.

Still, the outlook for the rest of the year remains murky as Tesla didn’t provide any official guidance, a departure from earlier this year, when the company said growth would return in 2025.

“Management initially guided for deliveries growth in 2025,” Seth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar, said in a note on Wednesday. “We interpret no guidance as a signal that management is no longer forecasting volume growth. This aligns with our expectation for deliveries to decline in 2025.”

Another 80% more to go before TSLA price makes any logical financial sense. Yeah the PE is still legitimately insane for a company that has declining sales, no real moat, and will get hammered by Trump's tax cut bill. It's highly likely they post a loss in Q4 this year.  Okay but have you seen party mode? Like the headlights can be one color and then ...... another different color. How do you not see the cross-industrial applications of this fruitful R&D budget expenditure? Elon quick say something about AI, robots, FSD coming soon! Pump that baby back up And guess what, in the countries with daily registration reporting, the first 3 weeks of July confirm the downward trend.

Trump is saying NVDA and other AI companies can create their own power grids and super power stations to power their AI in the US. What companies are supplying that power/power equipment? I'm looking to try to potentially invest in energy stocks and have been looking at GE Vernova. Will that be one of the companies? How and who will build these mega power grid infrastructure?
A lot of these names - GEV, PWR, EME, etc  - have already ran a lot. The industrial/utility/energy ""ai adjacent"" beneficiaries of all the spending have run for over a year already. In a *best case* scenario this could continue to be a nice theme for the next 3-5 years, but it's not early innings/a lot of the easy money has been made in something like GEV that's up almost 300% in the last year. His knowledge of AI and power grids is ""likely quite low""?

The guy who just recently demonstrated on national television that he *literally* doesn't understand how percentages work?

I think ""likely quite low"" is a bit of an understatement here xD I'm not going to get into politics. But I would only point out that Trump's knowledge of both AI and power grids is likely quite low.

Creating a separate, parallel power grid only for AI would not cost billions, but trillions.

Where would they generate the energy? Who's resources would they use? How would they deliver it?

Especially since Trump specifically detests both wind and solar.

Constellation is already in the process of reopening one of three mile islands undamaged reactors which will be used for Microsoft data centers and also provide power to Meta.

Watching Trump and Jpow at the Fed construction site was one of the most uncomfortable things Ive ever seen... Trump trying to humiliate Powell on live TV and somehow made himself look even dumber than usual. Absolute clown show. I guess Hulk Hogan wont be the next chair of the Fed after all I'm just going to say it.  We are living in a simulation.

Potus and Powell in hard hats, trading barbs, is just too ludicrous to be real.  It can only be the product of some degenerate programmer. GOOG 1% up is much better than I expected.

I’ll take it. 

Now we can begin the march to $250. Seems like a crazy market where you have to either hold your nose and buy stocks at crazy valuations based on 2028 earnings, or buy falling knives that cannot get out of their own way. He’s such an imposter and mobster.  

“I’d fire them!”

Ok tough guy.  Fire the contractors.  Under the contracts they’ll be paid anyway, and you’ll have to find someone else who will charge penalty pricing to come finish it.  

A guy who can’t work an umbrella is beaking about qualified workers who are welding steel and pouring concrete. president dip shit next to an actually brilliant financial mind. he’s probably long felt threatened by jpow  We get it coming from Trump.  He’s a low IQ pathological liar.  But hearing Siegel and Cramer and El-Erian and 80% of CNBC parroting false narratives and acting like a president trying to illegally fire yet another independent role is just “policy” shows how far we’ve fallen.

His accomplices even primed him with a stupid stunt of adding in the cost of different building that was done during Trump’s *own* term.

1m7z8sv,2025-07-24,"10 best trading days
I've been investing for a year, finally became green and have been beating the market this yr. I feel like I could have made even more money had I gone all in during the dips.

I recently came across this concept of always being fully invested because statistically the market has roughly 10 amazing trading days annually which contribute to most of the gains. Does this concept extend to individual stocks also or just SPY or other ETFs too?

Also how many such trading days have already occurred this year?
There have been a few.   Couple of note are April 9, 2025 with a gain of +9.52% and May 12, 2025 of +3.26% on the S&P 500.  

Obviously that April 9th is a huge outlier. ""I recently came across this concept of always being fully invested""

I don't think that you have to be fully invested at all times, but what I don't agree with is the ""all in or all out"" mentality. So many people seem to have little/no difficulty in randomly deciding to dump their entire portfolio because of a headline or one day they decide ""the market is up too much."" There is a middle where you can just dial down a bit and sell some into strength if the market has become overextended. Etfs are just a bunch of stocks bundled together. So yes it also applies to individual stocks. If you miss the best 10 days of a stock then you're obviously going to get much less gains or even a loss than if you were invested in those days too.

We don't know how many of the 10 best days have already occurred because we Cannot predict the future If you buy a stock at its peak and it crashes, it can take you decades to get your money back (if ever). Being ""always invested"" is an irrelevant concept without the details on what you're invested in and at what price levels you bought in at. 

Warren Buffet didn't get rich just willy-nilly buying stocks and holding them. That is such a naive argument. When you are invested, you will also see the days with the largest drops, in addition to the days with the largest gains. Market, yes. Individual stocks, no.

While the market will always recover and eventually make new highs, many individual stocks that peak and experience significant drawdowns in corrections and bear markets never recover. fr and ur gonna have a really bad time if you try to time the market [deleted] I read a study that went through concepts on best times to invest.

I've been following Tesla for a long time, and have been losing money trying to take bearish positions on TSLA. However bad the earnings are, or whatever Elon does or says, the stock defies common sense and logic. However, I do think that with the recent earnings, Tesla's 'meme stock' characteristics are finally fading away. It's not just the bad earnings and 'rough times' ahead as Elon calls it -- but my technical indicators also point to a bounce off the resistance around $335 ($337.82 was the level I was watching, to be precise).

1m7grhr,2025-07-23,"Tally of Microsoft Victims Surges to 400 as Hackers Capitalize on SharePoint Flaw
The number of companies and organizations compromised by a security vulnerability in Microsoft Corp.’s SharePoint servers is increasing rapidly, with the tally of victims soaring more than six-fold in a few days, according to one research firm.

Hackers have breached about 400 government agencies, corporations and other groups, according to estimates from Eye Security, the Dutch cybersecurity company that identified an early wave of the attacks last week. That’s up from roughly 60 based on its previous estimate provided to Bloomberg News on Tuesday.

The security firm said that most of the victims are in the US, followed by Mauritius, Jordan, South Africa and the Netherlands. The National Nuclear Security Administration, the US agency responsible for maintaining and designing the nation’s cache of nuclear weapons, was among those breached, Bloomberg reported earlier.

The hacks are among the latest major breaches that Microsoft has blamed, at least in part, on China and come amid heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing over global security and trade. The US has repeatedly criticized China for campaigns that have allegedly stolen government and corporate secrets over a period spanning decades.

“We estimate that the real number might be much higher as there can be many more hidden ways to compromise servers that do not leave traces,” Eye Security’s co-owner Vaisha Bernard said in an email to Bloomberg News. “This is still developing, and other opportunistic adversaries continue to exploit vulnerable servers.”

The organizations compromised in the SharePoint breaches include many working in government, education, and technology services, Bernard said. There were smaller numbers of victims in countries across Europe, Asia, the Middle East and South America.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is set to meet his Chinese counterparts in Stockholm next week for a third round of trade talks, suggested in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday that the SharePoint hacks will be discussed. “Obviously things like that will be on the agenda with my Chinese counterparts,” he said.

The security flaws allow hackers to access SharePoint servers and steal keys that can let them impersonate users or services, potentially enabling deep access into compromised networks to steal confidential data. Microsoft has issued patches to fix the vulnerabilities, but researchers cautioned that hackers may have already got a foothold into many servers.

Microsoft on Tuesday accused Chinese state-sponsored hackers known as Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon of being behind the attacks. Another hacking group based in China, which Microsoft calls Storm-2603, also exploited them, according to the company.

The Redmond, Washington company has repeatedly blamed China for major cyberattacks. In 2021, an alleged Chinese operation compromised tens of thousands of Microsoft Exchange servers. In 2023, another alleged Chinese attack on Microsoft Exchange compromised senior US officials’ email accounts. A US government review later accused Microsoft of a “cascade of security failures” over the 2023 incident.

Eugenio Benincasa, a researcher at ETH Zurich’s Center for Security Studies who specializes in analyzing Chinese cyberattacks, said members of the groups identified by Microsoft had previously been indicted in the US for their alleged involvement in hacking campaigns targeting US organizations. They are well known for their “extensive espionage,” he said.

It’s likely that the SharePoint breaches are being carried out by proxy groups that work with the government rather than Chinese government agencies directly carrying out the hacking, according to Benincasa. Private hacking companies in the country sometimes participate in “hacker for hire” operations, he added.

“Now that at least three groups have reportedly exploited the same vulnerability, it’s plausible more could follow,” he said.

“Cybersecurity is a common challenge faced by all countries and should be addressed jointly through dialogue and cooperation,” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun. “China opposes and fights hacking activities in accordance with the law. At the same time, we oppose smears and attacks against China under the excuse of cybersecurity issues.”

According to Microsoft, the hacking group Linen Typhoon was first identified in 2012, and is focused on stealing intellectual property, primarily targeting organizations related to government, defense, strategic planning, and human rights. Violet Typhoon, first observed in 2015, was “dedicated to espionage” and primarily targeted former government and military personnel, non-governmental organizations, as well as media and education sectors in the US, Europe, and East Asia.

The hackers have also used the SharePoint flaws to break into systems belonging to the US Education Department, Florida’s Department of Revenue and the Rhode Island General Assembly, Bloomberg previously reported.

If I learned anything from Crowdstrike, it’s that this is bullish because it proves enterprises cannot drop Microsoft no matter how bad it gets. Agreed.

1m7aper,2025-07-23,"TSLA is about to release a new round of financial results, under the heavy “headwinds”, can Musk rebuild market confidence?
Latest News Impact 

New 4680 Battery Capacity Expansion: Tesla announced to accelerate the construction of 4680 battery production line to reduce the cost and improve the range and performance, which will enhance the competitiveness of Model 3 and Model Y.

Supercharger network upgrade: Continued expansion of the charging network in an effort to take the high ground in EV infrastructure.

Self-driving software upgrade: FSD Beta continues to expand test users, and software subscription services bring continuous revenue streams.

Investor Perspective 

Strengths: Leading battery technology and continued capacity expansion, solid cash flow and strong vehicle sales, emerging growth point in energy business.

Risks: Raw material price volatility, global supply chain uncertainty and changes in the regulatory environment.

Valuation alert: TSLA's current valuation is still high and short-term volatility is inevitable, but long-term growth potential remains favorable.

What do people think of this earnings report? In particular, what do you think of the growth in the self-driving subscription and energy businesses? Will any investors bet on this earnings report for a trade?
He's gonna say sales are down, their AI robots are broken, and that EVs are going to be illegal and the stock will pop 14% Can a Nazi billionaire, drug fiend, snake oil salesman, polygamist, pedophile protector, turn this ship around? Who knows. 14%? Why so bearish? This reads like a Norm McDonald quote haha 😂 Hey they just opened a diner.. that serves organic food. That should be enough. New target. 500. ""Strengths: Leading battery technology and continued capacity expansion, solid cash flow and strong vehicle sales, emerging growth point in energy business.""

Absolute nonsense. They have moved on to pumping a diner at this point. He can say tesla will go bankrupt by the end of 2025 and the stock will still pop 14% 🤣. I don’t even know if I trust myself anymore at this point, I’m undecided whether I should sell while I’m ahead or yolo it for potential huge gains. Rebuilding market confidence? The stock has cratering sales, image and FCF and still has a valuation higher than the biggest car, EV, battery, robot, solar combined. 
It trades on nothing but confidence Tesla, a “tech” company, has a profit margin less than GM, a dying car company.

After months of watching everyone else’s “+300% in AI” or “sold before the crash” wins, I was seriously questioning if I’m just *bad* at this.

But today, my boring, long-term plays actually *did the thing*. Slow grinders like MSFT, VOO, and a couple of small-cap bets finally turned green in a way that made me breathe again. Not rich overnight, just *validated*.

I know markets go up and down. But man… sometimes it’s not about beating the market. It’s just about not feeling like a complete idiot.

I broke $200,000 today :D Congratulations to all the GOOG bulls! I love how suddenly everyone knew in hindsight there would be an indefinite pause on said tariffs, dollar would tank, and subsequent tariff talk would flip flop for months on end.

I mean, selling was stupid, but lets not act like everyone knew this would rebound this fast, or any of the above events were to happen a week into his announcement. Today is u/ICE-FlGHT's super bowl Cope and seethe from Musk. How tf do you miss on a guide down then have a miss of over 25% on Op Income. This guy is gonna find a way to merge SpaceX & xAI into this company to save the stock price from capsizing I swear. TSLA will have horrible earnings and go up.

GOOG will have great earnings and go down. When I read online comments about this Japan deal, people actually believe Japan is paying the tariff... I weep for humanity. So tired of CNBC platforming this dishonest and looney toons MAGA pundit Jeremy Siegel every day.

He’s a former professor and yet he’s saying utter lies such as “every president gets to pick their own Fed Chair every 4 years.”

Every single day he’s on pushing for the illegal, corrupt and dangerous firing of Jerome Powell.

Most days he frames it as if Powell is the problem and Powell is someone personally trying to obstruct Trump for political reasons.  Powell is a staunch Republican.

Today’s bad faith argument is that Powell should just voluntarily resign, to protect the “reputation” of the Fed.  

He’s currently saying Powell has made lots of bad mistakes and that he deserves to be fired because this is the most withering criticism a President has ever heaped on a Fed Chair.

He also claims that if Powell voluntarily resigns, Trump will willingly accept all the blame if anything goes wrong in the economy.

CNBC might as well have guests who say they saw Elvis and Bigfoot raiding Fort Knox. *TESLA 2Q FREE CASH FLOW $146M, EST. $760M

lol. I can't wait to see this green tomorrow.  GOOGL notes that 2026 will be a growth year for capex. They note that their 2025 spend is $85b+. Apply a 15% YoY growth rate and say hello to $100b in capex.

1m722mg,2025-07-23,"Just how strong is the Visa/Mastercard moat?
Disclosures: I hold both V and MA.

In Asia right now, you'd think as these countries develop and become more cashless like the west, it's prime growth areas for V and MA, but the locals pay by phone and not like Apple/Google pay where the underlying mechanics is still V and MA but by QR codes. 

How much more growth is there? 

Europe are talking of developing their own systems, emerging markets aren't using them (only foreign tourists). 

Could even QR code payment become a thing in the west making V/MA obsolete?

There's also the stablecoin thing but I don't really see this a necessarily a threat.
Europe could have had such system but it doesn't want to. Many countries have instant bank transfers, but they are separate. It's like someone is lobbying the EU to postpone e-payments forever. So, as long as the EU administration is in bed with Visa, they are safe. Not strong enough to justify their earnings multiples. PhonePe killed them in India. I expect similar technologies will erode its competitive power if governments support people welfare than company profits In the US people have such a knee jerk reaction against the government doing stuff, but after watching CC processors and banks apply pressure to companies to get them to stop doing business in industries that are controversial (like sex work) it has the potential to be better.

Running it at a non-profit service that exists to promote business is good. Assuming we eventually get back to the point where the government is in compliance with laws,... having a payment processor who is truly bound by the first amendment is actually a good thing. ""Debanking"" is overblown as an issue by the right, but it is something that happens from time to time and it is becoming more and more impossible to function in this world without access to banking. ""Could even QR code payment become a thing in the west making V/MA obsolete?""

V/MA are the ""rails"" for so many of these sorts of things.

""There's also the stablecoin thing but I don't really see this a necessarily a threat.""

https://corporate.visa.com/en/solutions/crypto/stablecoins.html

""How much more growth is there?""

I think there's certainly growth, but it's going to be slower than before and will require both (particularly Visa) to probably have to develop it in-house, as I'll guess if either tried to make a big purchase they'd run into antitrust (see: Visa's attempt to buy Plaid that was denied.) In Canada, we can pay by Interac (debit card) and transfer money without the use of Visa or Mastercard. Just need the other person's phone number or email. Although payment for consumer, Visa and Mastercard is still more popular. 

In China, people pay and receive money through Alipay and Wechat. There is also Union pay, but that is mostly for credit cards. So once again Visa and Mastercard are useless. In two biggest countries in Asia (China and inde), people don’t use visa, Mastercard Check out PIX in Brazil, UPI in India - V/MA don’t have anything to do with them Their moat imo is pretty strong due to Network effects. But like the catch is most businesses hate them lol. They do not want to pay a fee to Visa and Mastercard every time someone swipes their credit card. People don't think it's much but it can quickly add up especially for small businesses. That's why a lot of small businesses prefer cash.

If you're doing something that people don't like, people will innovate and try to kill your business. Just as an example people didn't like the late fees from Blockbuster. Netflix sprung up to counter them and then went on to kill their business.

Just my thoughts, don't own any of them and my thoughts as an outsider. As far as I know, the 'Ideal' system is purely a Dutch thing. Sure, other European shops may support it, but I don't know anyone outside the Netherlands using it. And, well, it's a very small country after all.

It is true that many (probably most?) people in Europe use debit cards, but those are also often, if not always, Mastercard or Visa. Even in the Netherlands, where they have their own ""bank cards"", those are owned by the two aforementioned companies, under the brands Maestro and VPAY, respectively. And those are being phased out right now.

That said, I do agree it should not be too hard to replace V/MA in Europe if there was sufficient push for it.

1m70tqy,2025-07-23,"Taking stock of Alphabet (GOOGL GOOG)
Going into earnings, GOOGL has been up 10 straight trading days, so is it time to sell?   Look at every single tech market where Alphabet is the dominant player or is in the top three.  In many instances, GOOGL created the market or disrupted the market incumbent.  It just emerged a few months ago that quantum computing was a thing; and which company had the breakthrough? Alphabet.  (Full Disclosure: I own 800 shares of GOOGL/GOOG and a child who works there)

No wonder the Department of Justice is so concerned about them; in Tech, scale and first mover advantage equate to market share and here's how Alphabet lines up in these disparate defined markets according to the DOJ:   

Ads and Ad technology:  1) Alphabet 2) Meta 

Search: 1) Alphabet 2) Microsoft

Maps: 1) Alphabet 2) Apple

Mobile Search: 1) Alphabet

Mobile hardware: 1) Apple 2) Samsung 3) Alphabet

Home Devices: 1) Amazon 2) Apple 3) Alphabet

Personal Devices: 1) Apple 2) Alphabet 

Productivity Software: 1) Microsoft 2) Alphabet

Browser: 1) Alphabet Chrome 2) Microsoft Bing

Mobile OS: 1) Alphabet Android 2) Apple IOS

Cloud: 1) Amazon 2) Microsoft 3) Alphabet

AI LLMs: 1) OpenAI 2) Alphabet 

AI Chip Design 1) Nvidia (GPU) 2) Alphabet (TPU)

Quantum Computing: 1) IBM 2) Alphabet

Social media 1) Facebook 2) Alphabet

Video MPVD Subscribers 1) Charter 2) Comcast 3) AT&T Directv 4) Alphabet YoutubeTV

Video Streaming Services 1) Alphabet Youtube 2) Netflix 3) Disney

Mobility/Self Driving 1) Alphabet Waymo 2) Tesla

Robotics: 1) Alphabet 2) Tesla
With their P/E where it is, I see no reason not to keep buying. The price is still suppressed for fears of a break up. Going into their January earnings report, Meta had an 8-day winning streak. After a small top line but big bottom line beat, they extended this into a 20-day streak. Not saying this will happen, but in the end, fundamentals matter.

Fortunately, Google has built up some momentum recently (even when the market has pulled back), but it still trading at a very low PE for its growth rate, and there's a bit of a rotation from YTD winners to laggards, so hopefully it will buck the recent trend of dumping even after blowout earnings. >  (Full Disclosure: I own 800 shares of GOOGL/GOOG and a child who works there)

... you own a child who works for Google? How is Alphabet #2 in social media? 

100 shares in GOOG, long term hold for most of the reasons you’ve listed. Thanks In for the long term. Let’s go! Obviously from Google+ Well, I did start out ""Going into earnings...""  Anyway Alphabet is playing the long game and I don't really think the earnings releases are that critical.  As some analyst said today, Alphabet is such a gigantic organization the CFO has many levers to pull to meet or beat earnings guidance so quarterly releases are pretty much meaningless to the market. He's counting Youtube as social media I guess? But imo Youtube is more like a competitor to Netflix imo.

Youtube also does play in the social media realm against Tiktok and Instagram Reels too. So they're kind of a hybrid player imo. Google always gets punished after earnings. It’s tradition. YouTube is the 2nd biggest search engine after Google search.

What's the logic for no RKLB? They are a us prime and have defense contracts And ASTS Thoughts on BKSY vs PL for space-based imagery? Am a bit concerned about $PPTA.  I think there will be longer delays than expected before they ramp up production.  I also think multiple dilutions are likely in the future (the joys of investing in small cap mining stocks).

UAMY is a funny situation... their CEO went on Fox to talk up the stock and it dived instead!  I think investors think that he was buttering them up for a dilution...his expansion plans are aggressive which makes dilutions extra likely.  Again the joys of investing in smallcap miners.  

I still like UAMY.  MP for me is buy and hold....guarantees are just too good. MP easily a 20+ billion company in a few years

i expect a +100% return over that time. 


China can manipulate rare earth prices all it wants, but if your trillion dollar company wants guaranteed access in their most vulnerable moment, they'll have to pay MP a premium at ALL times. just like the apple deal

They own the only antimony smelter in the US and bought up thousands of acres of old antimony mine claims in AK that they’re using to feed their mills and smelter.

1m6kwab,2025-07-22,"Is Google new AI model release Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite worth keeping an eye on?
Google just released Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite their fastest and lowest-cost AI model yet optimised for latency-sensitive tasks like translation and classification. Compared to previous versions it has lower latency and is more affordable

Many companies are already using it such as Satlyt to reduce latency and power consumption HeyGen to do automatic video translation DocsHound to process long videos and Evertune to analyse brand performance.

What does this mean for GOOGL stock?

I think this is another powerful weapon in Google AI infrastructure Lower costs and better performance will attract more developers and enterprise customers which is good for cloud service revenue in the long run Considering Google continued push for AI integration in search advertising and enterprise tools, this makes GOOGL growth potential look more robust.

Of course short-term tech stocks are volatile but from a 3-5 year or even longer perspective Google AI innovation and market position make it worth focusing on.

What do you think? Has anyone considered adding to their position in GOOGL? Or are you more interested in other AI track stocks?

1m6bt9z,2025-07-22,"$ENVX Enovix Corp undertaking transformative battery tech
DD on $ENVX Enovix Batteries Corp (posted on behalf of 2percentisfair on X)

Most battery tech journalism is frustrating because you will hear constant tales of a tech that will double or triple battery capacity, and then of course the change never happens. The reason for this is multi-faceted:

1) what works in a lab often doesn't work in real world conditions,
2) battery materials are like two faced super-models they can be absolutely perfect when looking at one metric, but can have debilitating shortcomings when looking at another, and

3) most of the time you need to see 100 different success stories in parallel to make a dramatic change happen, and the article speaks of the 1 improvement only and speaks as if the other 99 problems have already been solved.

If you're going to see a new type of battery that has the potential not to just dominate current markets, but to create entirely new markets for electrification; a convergence of multiple incredibly difficult to master technologies would need to happen in parallel. And there would need to be enabling tech that would allow each subcomponent to cover the flaws of the other so that in the aggregate you have a well-rounded battery that can dominate.

This type of battery is still a dream, anything more than a whisper and it can vanish. But for those of you who dare to dream with me, let me whisper away and explain what I might be seeing in the industry and how Enovix might play the crucial role in bringing it all together…

*Not financial advice, but if I were giving financial advice, I would advise you to assess ENVX based on the AI-1 battery and your assumptions as to market share, manufacturing, and margins that it can take in the  Consumer electronics space in the coming years.

So what type of potential battery am I talking about? A solid-state (sulfide based), sulfur cathode battery, with a pre-lithiated si anode. This type of battery would be sourced from cheap, scalable, and abundant materials with an energy density that could potentially enable regional flight or trans-pacific cargo shipping. But every step in that chain has immense hurdles to overcome before you can  get there. Let's evaluate the potential and the hurdles one by one, and let's see how it fits into the Enovix tech stack.

Let's start first with our baby, Enovix. I won't go deep into the details because my followers already know the story well. Enovix is not a Si battery company, it's a novel battery architecture, that has properties that enable it to use non-traditional battery materials. One such property is its ability to handle electrodes that swell. Electrodes that swell are the best kind, they swell because they are storing so much lithium they form a new alloy and balloon up in size. Intercalating (traditional) battery materials on the other hand can only store a little bit of lithium because they store the lithium between layers, like a bookshelf holding books.

So if you can build a battery mechanically designed to handle swelling, you've invented a new class of batteries. You've invented conversion class batteries.

But how does Enovix do this? Through a very simple trick in physics. Force=Pressure*Area. Enovix laser dices its electrodes and then stands them on their thin edge and stacks those thin edge standing electrodes for the width of their cell. What that has done is re-oriented the large face of the electrodes to the sides of the battery and not to the top of the battery. If using conversion style electrodes that swell, the larger part of the elctrodes are facing the small face of the battery (the side)  and not the large one. So again, F=P*A and what you've just done is dramatically reduced the A in the equation. That means you can dramatically reduce the F required in the equation to achieve a P that can constrain the urge to swell. Indeed, because of the orthogonal stacking, Enovix can easily add 10 Megapascals of stack pressure to the solid electrodes (the liquid electrolyte is under normal pressure) with a tiny constraint system. Typical prismatic cells have stack pressure around 0.1 Mpa maybe to up to 1 Mpa.

And then as a bonus, the shape of these electrodes stood on their thin edge provides easy access to pre-lithiate si anodes.

And then as an even better bonus the orientation just happens to be perfectly shaped like a heat exchanger. Having all of these strips of electrodes oriented this way allows uniform and very close access to cooling. We're talking 33x more efficient cooling. You can get the heat out of the center of the cell uniformly with ease.

There are other advantages, but for the rest of this discussion, Enovix's ability to provide stack pressure and its ability to provide extreme thermal control are going to be the two properties of the architecture that enable the rest of the magic I will soon discuss.


The next element of that super battery I need to discuss is the solid state element. ""Solid state is the holy grail of battery development"" is a common refrain. That's mostly marketing (inside joke for me), but solid state does have some extreme advantages.

Upsides:
1) Imagine picking up two bags of sand. One is wet and one is dry. Which one is lighter? A lot lighter

2) Because the electrolyte layer IS the separator, you get rid of the inactive separator. You also get rid of other inactive components that don't need to be there if there is no liquid electrolyte.

3) Often conflated with solid state tech is actually just anode side improvements. Solid state often works better with pure lithium metal on the anode side than can be done with liquid electrolytes; in a liquid electrolyte you have a more unstable SEI layer and in solid state you can have a stronger anode electrolyte      interface which can enable pure lithium metal anodes. That translates to serious gains for the whole system similar to what enovix sees by making massive anode side improvements using si. *I'm still skeptical on lithium metal working in the real world. It always will work in the lab, but lithium metal exists nowhere in nature as li metal because its too reactive.

4) No flammable electrolyte reduces fire hazard.

Downsides:
A battery is just a reversible chemistry reaction where negative electrons (electricity) flow in and out and positive ions (lithium in this case) flow back and forth between two electrodes. The flow of those positive ions is easier to facilitate in a liquid vs in a solid. But serious progress has been made using solids.

Ionic conductivity: this is the challenge of moving positive ions around. Surprisingly, sulfide based      electrolyte layers are getting so good that their Siemens per centimeter (how much resistance to moving ions) is approaching that and sometimes      exceeding liquid electrolytes. Quite frankly, this is miracle number 1 in the whole chain. The better the ionic conductivity, the thinner the electrolyte gets to be and just like regular separators thinner is better both for volume and for weight and for cost. Sulfide solid state has a clear advantage over oxide/ceramic based ones that have to be thicker both for ionic conductivity reasons and for brittleness reasons.

Interfacial Connection: think  of a relay race. The ionic conductivity is how fast the runners can run but the interface between the cathode->solid electrolyte->anode is like the baton exchange in a relay race. This is where SSB's tend to struggle. But it turns out, with sulfide based electrolyte layers high stack pressure can greatly improve the interfacial connection allowing for  a uniform and seamless connection between the layers of battery. (*hint, Enovix architecture easily provides stack pressure).

Hot spots and heat transfer issues. The liquid electrolyte doesn't just transfer the ions effectively,      it also transfer heat around the cell, bringing it to the edge of the cell where it can cooled. Without that liquid electrolyte, even though its less flammable, those hot spots will kill cycle life and cause degradation issues if not dealt with. *If only there were a perfect architecture for thermal control.

Dendrites in a lithium metal anode. Sulfide based SSB are considered more prone to dendrites than oxide      based SSB's. This is likely why NIO, makes their semi-solid state battery based on a sulfide layer with a prelithiated Si-C mix on the anode side rather than the lithium metal side. (I wonder who else can do that anode side trick….but at a much higher % of Si-C?)

Moisture sensitivity: sulfides are extremely sensitive to moisture and current manufacturers like Toyota have worked to use additives and coatings that make it less      so.

Manufacturability: Can you make the electrolyte? Once you've made that, can you then use it when      manufacturing the cell itself? Sulfide based electrolytes are extremely sensitive to moisture and oxygen, and using them to make a cell would likely require at least some of the steps to be done in a pure argon or a pure nitrogen environment, which means lights off automation would be required for those steps.

I don't want to understate the challenge here. Being able to allow ion transfer in a solid electrolyte is incredibly challenging to make happen in a cell, and incredibly difficult to manufacture in a scalable process. But there are at least two companies (Nio and Cherry) already taking this trick to production ready cells in China, and companies like Toyota/Samsung/Solid Power all have made incredible progress. Sulfide based SSB's are clearly stepping out of the proof of concept stage and starting to be ready for the next level. If you add in an architecture that easily adds stack pressure and thermal control, you might be on to something…

$ENVX

We've now made it to the cathode side of this super battery equation. Sulfur based cathodes. Unlike every single other battery cathode on the marketplace today that is intercalating, sulfur is a conversion style cathode. That means it forms an alloy with the lithium and can store much Much MUCH more lithium than anything else on the market. It's also incredibly abundant, cheap, and light.

So why the hell are you just hearing about it now? Did an anon on Twitter discover this wonder battery material under everyone's nose? Of course not. Sulfur is the definition of the two-faced supermodel. It's amazing in some respects, and atrocious in other respects. If you can find a way to cover its weaknesses, you have a potential super battery.

What are those weaknesses? First and foremost you have serious cycle life issues resulting from ""polysulfide shuttling."" Lithium sulfur undergoes multiple reactions when it takes in and then releases lithium and in this process tiny ""polysulfides"" can escape to the anode side and this absolutely wrecks any hope of cycle life you had with the battery. Current lithium sulfur cathode makers are trying to mitigate this by using various carbon products to trap the polysulfides before they shuttle away.

But it turns out there is a much more effective way to contain the number 1 problem of polysulfide shuttling. The solution is to pair sulfur based cathodes with sulfide based solid state electrolytes. This 100% filters out any polysulfides shutting all the way to the anode. 100%. Now there likely still is some impact from cathode side only polysulfide shuttling, but we're talking 95% of the problem is solved for you if you can pair sulfur cathode with sulfide electrolyte.

So once again, did I, an anon on twitter just discover this amazing trick that has eluded battery chemists for decades? Of course not. As a conversion style cathode, Sulfur expands and contracts by up to 80% of its volume in charge and discharge. This means that the number one unsolved problem for SSB's, that of interfacial contact between the layers, becomes virtually impossible to do with sulfur based cathodes making the point moot. 

But what if you have a battery architecture that can easily add in extremely high stack pressure in such a way that the expansion is controlled. The interface between the particles even in a sulfur cathode are perfectly uniform and perfectly in contact with a sulfide based electrolyte? That's exactly what Enovix can do. 

But sulfur's amazing potential isn't purely held back by polysulfide shuttling. It also is known for very low power output. We're talking 0.1 C power output (weak sauce), when the batteries required for drones are going to need to be on the order of 10C. This is where the work of the cathode manufacturers pairing it with new types of easily made carbon are making massive amounts of progress. Multiple companies and universities are now testing lithium sulfur based cathodes that are both high capacity and high power now, unheard of only a few years ago.

The next downside to sulfur unfortunately is volumetric density. Gravimetrically it is untouchable. Volumetrically it is weak. Cathode makers have to use low sulfur loading to increase its power output and also a lot of binder to glue it together during its expansion and contraction. In addition, they try to space it out pretty far apart to allow for said expansion and contraction. Once again, the Enovix high stack pressure can make a dramatic difference here. It can greatly reduce the amount of binder required, and the mechanical system is designed for the stuff to be packed in tight, because it is a conversion class battery designed to handle the swell.

The final problem I will discuss is one of heat. All Enovix investors know, the secret to extreme fast charge is rapid and uniform heat extraction from the center of the cell during charging. Fast charge brings in a ton of resistive heating related to bringing all that power in at once. But lesser known, is the fact that most intercalating cathode materials have a slightly endothermic reaction when the cathode gives up the lithium during charging. This means the chemical reaction that occurs during charging of say an LCO cathode, actually reduces the heat in the cell not adds to it. But sulfur is different. When it gives up the lithium, that multi stage reaction is exothermic at every stage. Meaning, if you want to fast charge you now have to get the resistive heat (resistive heat is why a toaster gets hot) out as well as the heat from the chemical reaction itself. And to add pain to this equation, if you're doing all of this in a solid state battery, you don't have a liquid that can rapidly transfer the heat from the center of the cell to the edge. If you don't have a battery form factor/architecture specifically designed for rapid heat extraction, you are going to create hotspots that kill the cycle life of your battery.

Hopefully now you are starting to see why having a battery that can provide high stack pressure and extreme thermal control is not just a nice to have, but is absolutely crucial to making this type of battery work.

$ENVX

We're now to the anode side. I won't belabor this point because everyone knows this is already where Enovix shines. It takes 100% Si-C, prelithiates it, and then uses that anode side advantage in conjunction with regular LCO on the cathode to create the AI-1 battery that is about to take the high margin consumer electronics space by storm.

I will reiterate, that the knock on sulfide based solid state electrolyte is that it is more prone to dendrite formation when compared with oxide based SSB. So while sulfides are basically twice as ionically conductive allowing it to be much thinner (both lighter and more volumetrically dense), it may not be as reliable when using lithium metal. Well, the very easy solution to this is to use si on the anode side, especially if you're partnering with a si anode expert.

BTW, NIO currently makes semi-solid state batteries (using traditional cathode materials and retaining half the liquid weight because its only semi solid state), and they use si on the anode side presumably for this exact reason. In real world conditions, the only route to get to extremely high cycle life for this type of battery is si on the anode side not li metal imho.

$ENVX

Let me summarize. There is a whisper of a dream for a potential battery that would not just be an upgrade to existing batteries, it would be a world changing technology that future historians would list alongside the invention of the steam engine. But in order to achieve this multiple miracles from an entire ecosystem of companies and universities would have to happen in parallel and the subcomponents all have to work in concert to hide each other's weaknesses.

But, in theory.....

1) The main weakness of the  sulfur based cathode (polysulfide shuttling) can be solved by using a      sulfide based SSB

2) The main weakness of a SSB, especially when paired with an expanding and contracting sulfur based      cathode (interfacial connectivity), can be solved by high stack pressure easily achieved using Enovix architecture.

3) The second main weakness for sulfur based cathodes of volumetric density, can be dramatically improved by the high stack pressure easily achieved using Enovix Architecture.

4) The serious problem of dendrite formation from a sulfide based SSB can be solved using pre lithiated si on the anode side rather than li metal, a technique Enovix has already perfected.

5) The serious problems regarding heat extraction and thermal control that would come from a sulfur based cathode having exothermic reactions during charging, and made  worse by an all solid battery without the liquid electrolyte to transfer heat around, would have to be solved by a battery architecture that      specifically enables rapid and uniform heat extraction.

All of this would have to be manufactured by teams of experts capable of manufacturing in extreme      environments. Microchip manufacturers do that every day.

Other problems like power output for sulfur based cathodes or ionic conductivity for sulfide based solid electrolytes are immensely challenging, but appear to be being solved by multiple companies as we speak. Enovix potentially can serve as the architecture and partner that enables it all. 

Now the beauty of this whole thing is, it's not a zero to 1 proposition for Enovix. As we speak, Enovix is about to capitalize on being able to produce batteries with JUST the anode side of this equation. The AI-1 battery that is north of 900 Wh/L, has a 3C charge rate, high cycle life, and AI enabling power output is the result of only one side of this equation paired with an LCO cathode. And after that, if they're challenged they'll implement a higher voltage cathode (likely specially coated LCO) to continue their dominance. But in the background, they can be working on bringing together the next gen battery ecosystem required to make this much bigger dream happen. Maybe the next step is just the SSB side. And then the final step would be the sulfur cathode paired with it all. This is all wildly speculative, but extremely exciting. It should at least be known that these potential tech tree combinations appear to be coming together. 

Enovix, come for smartphone opportunity, stay for the chance to change the world. Good luck out there.
I have accidentally traded this name somewhat sucessfully since jan 2023. This is my most speculate position because the opportunity here is huge, IF they succeed. These last ~3 years has been quite the ride for this company but I think they are finally getting there.

ENVX reminds me of AMD in 2017. AMD came up with major CPU architectural change. Chiplets. It took them few iterations but look at their CPU's now vs Intel. Enovix is the same thing. Their advantage is their arhictecture vs traditional batteries. Allthough I don't think these batteries are good for every industry. They claim to be material agnostic too, so if or when materials get better, so will their batteries. They also claim to have roadmap for years. AMD said the same thing in 2017 and look at them now. Now generate the counter argument There are many risks. New battery companies historically have not done well.

- If they cannot manufacture these at over 90% yields (more like over 95%) then the business doesn't really work. They have said something along these lines in some earnings call

- Other yet unknown issues with this battery architecture

- Margins and valuation

- Other battery manufacturers keep improving their batteries making these batteries unattractive

- Other actual major battery breakthrough which we keep hearing every other week which never materialize I know it’s a competitor (kind of) but have you looked into AMPX? Would be curious to hear your view given all the research you have done I’ve liked ENVX for years. Entered and exited between $7-15 several times how do you ""accidentally"" trade a stock? Not really a competitor, 2 completely different markets. Also ampx cycle life is unusuable for CE and EV, and engineered silicon (amprius) is much more expensive than an architectural change that is material agnostic You share a slide on an EV cell. The AI-1 is a mobile cell. Completely different chemistries. They have stated the value proposition in EV is more related to fast charging due to the heat dissipation properties. 

The high density silicon chemistries are for consumer electronics, AI-1 (comparable to EX1M) is already 900wh/L and the next generations are projected to go well beyond 1000wh/L, because they can use 100% silicon in the anode. 

In cars the chemistry would be different, which is okay because fast charge is a lot more important in cars than actual density

They are entering the phone market this year, so not just bound to wearables. The big fish theyre going after is smartphones Well maybe accidentally/luckily making a profit by trading it. I don't consider myself a trader, at least didn't few years ago. I usually buy and see my thesis through fully, continously holding and adding more over time. With this name I've done few complete exists and then bought back in few months later. From an old 8K in 2021 (so keep in mind this is dated but just to illustrate that the graph you share is not relevant for mobile cells):

EX-1: 900 Wh/L energy density 2022
EX-2: 1,030 Wh/L energy density 2023
EX-3: 1,255 Wh/L energy density 2025

[link to the 8K](https://ir.enovix.com/static-files/c1e1c4fe-ed73-43f9-8116-deb241613794)

Take this with a grain of salt obviously this was before management change etc but they are already working on EX4M right now, safe to say these densities will be achieved and thats where the true value is.

This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on technical analysis (TA), but if TA is not your thing then just ignore the theme.

Some helpful day to day links, including news:

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

I have SPY and VYM in my portfolio but I'm trying to actively trade a few things, IWM being one of them. My hope was that IWM was lagging and would eventually pick up steam, but it's not looking great right now, sitting below all time high and not making a higher high today. Is there a bull case for IWM or should I look elsewhere? This is specifically for active trading where I want something that only has moderate volatility, not something that has a high risk of going -50% on some bad news.
The *bull case* for IWM is interest rates going down. Average volume 32m and you're saying it lacks liquidity lol Nope. Too costly/lacks liquidity for institutions. No weight in diversified global funds that passive investors are buying. Nobody wants to own IWM because small caps have had poor returns the last number of years.

1m5rw4o,2025-07-21,"Where are you stashing your cash reserves?
I plan to keep ~10-15% cash reserves in my account, but am unhappy with the eroding dollar. I’ve considered stashing in a combo of SGOV, SLV, GLD, and EUR/USD forex etf, but I’m no expert in commodities or forex.

Wondering if these are the best options. Where are you guys stashing cash? Do you think the USD fall continues enough to make it worth it to find places other than cash to park it? 

Counterpoint is that the USD/EUR is still not outside rather recent historical ranges, so maybe the eroding dollar as a long term trend is still a mirage.
SGOV for now, but I’m looking for longer term alternatives. Spaxx Memo received, all in on SPACs Too much doom. Just keep cash in Vanguard money market paying 4.2 percent. Been with Vanguard for 25 years and been through tech bubble, global financial crisis etc. Also no need to have so much cash. More cash has never benefitted me.

patient redditors rewarded GOOG finally waking up People over at WSB are starting to post tens to hundreds of thousands lost with the OPEN rug pull. Meme stocks just aren’t worth it man. This type of behavior is insane.  Markets don't care but there is some actual risk out there.


Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., is referring Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for criminal charges, accusing him of two specific instances of lying under oath.


Luna is accusing Powell of perjury on two occasions, according to a letter to the DOJ first obtained by Fox News Digital.


It comes as conservative Trump allies continue to demand that Powell, a Trump appointee himself, be fired before his term expires in mid-2026. We would have already had rate cuts, and I think we legitimately could have had another +30% year if not for tariffs and other stupidity coming from the WH. obligatory moment of silence for everyone who sold in april and who invested in healthcare stocks the past year. New ATH on retirement account

1m5j9e5,2025-07-21,"Verizon Beats Estimates, Microsoft in Security Crisis, Equinix Gets Aggressive Buy as Tech Earnings Week Begins
This week's market focus will be on big tech company earnings reports. Today's pre-market index gains, especially in Nasdaq futures, reflect the market's expectations for tech stocks. Here are four stock moves I'm watching:



🔹 Microsoft (MSFT): down 0.3% premarket as SharePoint software was revealed to be under “active attack”. The software is widely used within government and business. Microsoft has issued a security patch, but the incident may have a short-term impact on customer confidence.



🔹 Verizon (VZ): Shares up 4.6% premarket after Q2 results beat estimates and raised the lower end of its full-year profit estimate range to 1%-3%. Strong wireless service revenue growth and healthy customer base expansion. Adjusted EPS of $1.22 beat estimates.



🔹 Alaska Airlines (ALK): up 0.9% premarket. Operations have now resumed despite a nationwide flight suspension due to an IT outage. Both the company and its subsidiaries have suffered recent cybersecurity incidents, which may prompt them to step up their IT investments in the future.



🔹 Equinix (EQIX): 2.5% pre-market gain after activist investor Elliott adds stake. Elliott has reportedly become one of the top 10 shareholders in EQIX. The company is a data center REIT with potential long-term upside in AI data processing needs.



📊 Personal view:



For Microsoft, this security incident may be a stock price disruptor in the short term, but the long term still needs to look at its cloud services and AI deployment capabilities.



Verizon's fundamentals are solid and its valuation remains attractive, especially against the backdrop of a high dividend yield.



Structural revaluation opportunities may exist in EQIX if it continues to get a boost from activist investors.



💬 Position Disclosure: There are currently no positions in any of the above stocks; consider taking a position in EQIX or VZ in the coming week.

1m5j83u,2025-07-21,"Morgan Stanley: AMZN Top Pick, Boosts Internet Stock Outlook
Morgan Stanley upgraded PINS to Overweight and ETSY to Equalweight, naming AMZN its top internet stock, citing a more favorable macro outlook and lower expected China tariffs. The firm raised its U.S. online ad growth forecast for 2025 to 11% (from 8%), driven by improved sentiment and lowered tariff risks.

  
AMZN is seen with 33% upside to a $300 target, fueled by AWS strength and expected earnings acceleration into H2 2025–2026. GPU-driven innovation is also boosting sector growth. 

  
Generative AI is expected to be a key earnings driver for GOOGL and META, though Morgan Stanley prefers GOOGL for its more attractive 11% upside (target: $205). Confidence in AI sustainability will be crucial to maintaining momentum. With improving macro conditions and a more bullish outlook on digital advertising and AI, stocks like META, BGM, AMZN, PINS, GOOGL, and ETSY could benefit from renewed investor enthusiasm across the internet and tech ecosystem.

  
Big Tech capex is expected to hit $ 392B in 2026, up 21% YoY, with AMZN, GOOGL, META, and MSFT accounting for 58% of that spend.
Since no one else has commented I will. I used to own Amazon and the big 4 things I’d look at are Subscriptions, Third party logistics and advertising and cloud. If those 4 were growing double digits. I was happy and thought those results were good for me. I sold it to reallocate it to meta and others last year. 

AWS did slow down last quarter and third party services has been slowing down too. Would want to see them reaccelerate again imo. Tariffs only matter when we’re selling! I don’t see the global moat to brush off their valid concerns from *checks note* a month ago CapEx only up 21% in 2026?

1m5if2a,2025-07-21,"DOJ antitrust case against Google could hit Apple harder than expected $20Byear in question
It looks like the Department of Justice is about to announce a remedial decision in Google's antitrust case Most people are focusing on Alphabet but Apple may be at greater risk in the short term.

According to Morgan Stanley the case directly threatens the roughly $20 billion-plus that Google pays Apple annually for defaulting to Google's search engine on the iPhone. It's a huge but rarely discussed cash flow that is now coming into focus.

Base case according to MS 

Judge Mehta restricts exclusivity Think of the EU's selection screen 

Google still pays Apple \~2% by 2027 Not a huge but not insignificant impact on Apple's EPS 

Worst case 

Total ban on Google's payments to Apple = 10% reduction in EPS 

Apple could retest April's low 

Extreme case unlikely Apple builds its own search engine MS Says EPS will fall by more than 20% by FY27 

Any decision is likely to go through an appeals process so nothing will change overnight but pricing can start now especially if the market responds to the long term risks ahead of time 

My view Google may ride it out EU shows that even given the choice users will still choose Google AAPL's service margins are more fragile than people think 

Maybe it's time to reassess the share of search revenue in Apple's valuation



Not financial advice, just sharing thoughts. Anyone else adjusting their positioning around this issue, or just waiting for a ruling?
Been playing this game long enough to know that markets rarely react all at once it feels like everyone is waiting for the DOJ to shoot but if this is just a selective screening programme we could get a mild move in the short term and reprice over time nevertheless Apple losing $20bn in pipeline? That no small change You don’t pay $20B a year unless that deal prints multiples of that The risk here isn’t that Google loses Apple it that regulators around the world realize how insanely profitable that pipeline is. The U.S. ruling could be the first domino And it's a free 20B for Google back to them while they can keep the momentum of what they already have as userbase. Even if their marketshare goes down, they have Android which gives them a big marketshare for search and it's unlikely that 100% of the iOS userbase goes to Bing/Ecosia/Duckduckgo. At the end of the day, the users would stick for a while using Google search. Lol, no.  I'm not here to pre-empt the ruling if the market overreacts I have a tracking position and a plan I'm acutely aware that when regulators get involved clarity>persuasive first get the headlines buzzing then let the charts tell the truth This is such an underrated risk in Apple’s business model It’s not something to thumb your nose at and also it’s pure profit for Apple so it will hurt net income This is actually solid information although I’m not invested in Apple myself. Theoretically if Apple were to miss out on $20B annually.. that would take Apple back to net income levels pre 2021, or am I tripping? Since they’re around $93B in net income as of Sep-2024. (Assuming the $20B is after taxes.)

Please correct me if I’m wrong!

If it’s simply counted into revenue then that would set them back from $391B to $371B as of Sep-2024. Which imo is survivable long term, but most likely devastating short term.

1m52zbb,2025-07-20,"AI Action Day This Wednesday
I posted a couple days ago expressing my view that money can be made by being on top of trump's agenda, policy-related news, etc. I'm not saying its easy, but I think in several instances so far this year, the ""puzzle pieces"" have been out there, and if you put them together, you could have positioned ahead of the news. MP was one i mentioned in my previous post but there have been others.

To get to the point... There is an ""AI Action Day"" event happening on Wednesday. Hosted by All-In podcast people (David Sachs) and with various tech leaders in attendance as well as Trump of course.  Supposedly this will be an announcement of a larger strategy to promote US AI dominance. I would bet that there are opportunities here. Not clear if there is a home run, but I think a smart person could figure out a smart way to play this.

Unfortunately, I'm not a smart person, but maybe collectively as a group of not-smart people, we can figure out some plays here.

I can't link sources for some reason, keeps deleting my post, but you guys can google more information regarding the event if you want. TLDR It's being hosted

Technology leaders participating in the event include **Chris Power, CEO of Hadrian**; **Shyam Sankar, CTO of Palantir**; **Paul Buchheit, Partner at YCombinator; James Litinsky, CEO of MP Materials; Lisa Su, CEO of AMD.**

Additional speakers are still being confirmed.

I don't think the obvious choices are going to move much here. NVDA is already up significantly and i don't expect any announcements big enough to move a 4 trillion market cap... The easing of chip restrictions is also already priced in now. I expected this will be touched on at the event, but it's no longer news.

Spitballing but a few ideas:

I think energy will be a major focus of any strategy announcement. This is an area that is critically important for AI, and an area where the US is SIGNIFICANTLY lagging China. I'm not too sure how this could be played, but I'm considering EQT. I was looking at them last week due to the PA AI event. The stock didn't move much unfortunately, but all of nat gas seems to have struggled to close the week for whatever reason. By no means an expert here, but EQT has a major grift angle in that their CEO is closely tied to the republican party/trump.

Datacenter buildout: PWR, ACM, FLR - not really sure here. Chatgpt helped me on this one. Maybe APLD? Could be some type of policy/tax incentive to stimulate datacenter construction. not that its really needed at this point...

I'm really just spitballing and hoping to start some conversation here.
Nuclear engineering graduate here, have to say nuclear is just sooo far behind. Let's consider all of the things needed to get a plant outputting commercially. Impact assessment and feasibility process (environment, economic, social,etc), regulator approval for: assessment, siting, constructing, fuelling, operating all taking multiple years (have to prove safe at all reactor power levels, multiple factors more complex than say LNG). We have to consider how long training operators will take. A lot of the experienced workforce from the 80s/90s is retiring right now, we haven't built enough plants to increase or even maintain the collective level of technical knowledge/experience in the field for the past 30 years. Training a field operator to full proficiency takes up to 5 years of in class and field experience. Then you need multiple levels of people more experienced than them to oversee operational authority. 
Also, nuclear education at an academic level is as low as it's ever been, so engineering is behind. Scaling nuclear requires a scaling regulator, scaling supply chain. 

All this compared to LNG, I think nuclear is up to 10 years from starting to scale in the frid, and up to 15-20 years away from being singularly viable to sustain the amount of energy that will be needed. The government needs to bridge the gap with gas. Has to. Personally I think its ridiculous the gains these nuclear companies are getting, because I don't think the market and particularly retail realize how far away that is. IREN has been really good for my portfolio You want pre revenue power companies like NPWR, SMR, OKLO, NNE because Trump is likely to make it way easier for them to build their first power generation site. Looking at NWPR - gonna do a bit of research. I like danny rice as CEO. Adds a grift angle which i'm always looking for. I think the rice bros are well connected politically.

I have small positions in SMR/OKLO but i think these companies are long term plays regardless of permitting. I'm more interested in short term energy plays - i think natural gas will be used to fill the gap between now and when SMRs are a reality.

Do you have more information on NWPR? Stock is down a ton but i know nothing about it yet. Maybe. I kind of like natural gas a bit more because I think nuclear is more of a long term strategy. Not saying this won't be part of any announcement, I just think there could be some kind of shorter term strategy revolving around natural gas potentially. I think the general idea is that nuclear is probably the best solution especially with SMRs, but the tech is new and even traditional reactors take a long time to build. We need something to fill the gap between now and when nuclear can be a real alternative. Natural gas seems to be the obvious choice as far as I can tell, but I know very little about energy.

I like EQT because it's smaller market cap than the giants, and for the grift factor. Maybe there are some better alternatives though. I'll do more digging. Hopefully others chime in. Maybe more nuclear announcements from private sector? There are so many players in the energy field I almost feel like you'd be better off buying an ETF, if there's a good one to buy. Of course, expense ratio and dilution (with losers) will hurt your gains, but trying to guess who wins feels like playing roulette. Great insights. I’m just thinking what would take a heavy lift from the Gov that would need some sort of announcement. LNG deal with Canada or maybe hydro with them as well? I saw people buying 60C expiring 8/8 with 3M premium and put selling $58 strike with 1M premium and I’m also bullish on Nuclear stocks such as SMR I saw someone bought $55C 8/1 with1.35 M premium paid just sharing what I saw someone buying Are those eqt contracts?

1m4t8er,2025-07-20,"Nvidia Will Continue Controlling The AI Board
Nvidia is the 'queen' of the AI ecosystem, dominating hardware, software, and systems and controlling key segments from training to inference and networking.

Unmatched AI leadership, explosive revenue growth, and strategic partnerships with players like Astera Labs, Credo, and Super Micro Computer reinforce Nvidia's central role.

China market access and the Omniverse platform provide significant new growth drivers, supporting a strong 12-24 month growth outlook and a buy rating.

Despite high absolute valuation multiples, Nvidia's rapid growth and favorable PEG ratios make it attractive versus peers; the main risk is US-China geopolitical tension.

I believe these companies are well-positioned in the AI ecosystem, but I realise that one piece is missing: the queen. Just like in a game of chess, the queen is the most powerful and versatile piece on the board. It can move in any direction (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) and quickly cover a wide area. That is why I believe it is a perfect fit for NVIDIA (NVDA). I say this because it dominates both offensively and defensively. Just as the queen controls most of the board, NVDA controls the most valuable parts of the AI infrastructure, from training to inference, simulation, and networking. Secondly, it is versatile and critical because it spans hardware, software, and systems. This is cool because few participants can match its breadth and influence. Finally, it leverages strategic partnerships. I mean, just as the queen commands pawns, rooks, and bishops, NVDA integrates system builders (such as Super Micro Computer (SMCI)), connectivity providers (such as Credo Technology Group (CRDO) and Astera Labs (ALAB)), and government AI programmes to expand its control over the AI battlefield.

So why is the queen so special?

Well, several factors set Nvidia apart. First and foremost, it holds an unparalleled leadership position in the AI field, thanks to the combination of hardware, software, and ecosystem advantages. Its Blackwell GPU architecture makes it uniquely special. Combined with the Omniverse simulation platform, we are driving self-reinforcing AI, which is driving explosive growth. For example, in the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year, NVDA achieved revenue of $44.1 billion, representing a year over year increase of 69%. Data centre revenue reached $39.1 billion, up 73%. Some of Nvidia's key customers such as Microsoft , Google  OpenAI, and Meta  deploy tens of thousands of Nvidia's latest GPUs each quarter. For example, according to SA Weebler Finance data, hyperscale data centre operators are running approximately 1,000 NVLink rack systems (about 72,000 GPUs) per week, with further increases expected. Ideally, this means Nvidia's data centre run rate in the AI computing sector has exceeded $170 billion annually.

Secondly, NVDA's stack is also expanding beyond GPUs. As I mentioned, its global industrial simulation platform is now being used to digitise entire factories and cities. In fact, the platform has evolved to support critical infrastructure. Original equipment manufacturers like BMW are running over 30 virtual factories on the platform to optimise production in advance. As each AI solution requires an increasing amount of synthetic training data, NVDA's end-to-end solutions form an unparalleled moat. Ideally, this platform means more users generating more simulation data, ultimately driving demand for more Nvidia computing resources. What I see is that NVDA is now at the centre of the AI value chain.

Finally, the U.S. has approved the resumption of exports of NVIDIA H20 AI GPUs to China. This means NVIDIA will be able to access China's potential market, which is significant. According to a Morgan Stanley report, China's AI market is expected to reach $1.4 trillion by 2030.

China has been systematically implementing a long-term strategy to build its domestic artificial intelligence capabilities. Its strong academic foundation, innovative methods, data, talent, and growing foreign investment are driving it toward becoming a leading artificial intelligence powerhouse...

‘...China is less concerned with building the most powerful AI capabilities and more focused on bringing AI to market. China embraces open-source AI, while the United States appears to be moving toward closed, tightly controlled AI systems...’

‘...The next 6 to 12 months will be a critical period for Chinese AI companies, as more and more deployments aimed at solving real-world problems begin to demonstrate productivity gains.’

Due to this milestone, NVDA's Jensen Huang estimates that NVDA's potential market size  in China will reach $50 billion. This means that China's spending on AI will increase, and Nvidia's growth prospects are expected to be stronger than ever before. I expect this growth outlook to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly earnings report to be released on 27 August 2025.

These factors combined will undoubtedly accelerate Nvidia's growth trajectory over the next 12 to 24 months. Therefore, I assign a ‘Buy’ rating to Nvidia Corporation.

Nvidia's AI Ecosystem

Having highlighted the case for NVDA, I would like to connect it to some AI components I have researched previously. Some of these AI companies have remarkable growth prospects and are expected to align their growth trajectories with NVDA. Additionally, the connections between NVDA and these AI companies will help us better understand NVDA's future direction.

First, Astera Labs  is a leading connectivity chip company that recently went public in 2024. ALAB's chips support scalable and low-latency GPU rack interconnects. For more information on Astera Labs and its chips, please refer to Article 1 and Article 2. Now, Nvidia has publicly announced its collaboration with Astera on NVLink Fusion. This collaboration expands NVDA's total addressable market (TAM).

There is also Credo Technology, which is known for its active cables  re-timers, and SerDes chips. According to SA Oakoff Investments, most hyperscale computing vendors now consider CRDO's AEC to be the de facto standard for in-rack links. This means that AEC cables are the infrastructure required for NVDA's 72-GPU Blackwell rack.

Third, Super Micro Computer  and Celestica  manufacture and sell GPU racks and systems using NVDA technology. Nvidia currently provides complete data centre racks containing tens of thousands of GPUs, which are delivered to system builders like SMCI and CLS. They then collaborate with NVDA to package and sell these racks to hyperscale customers such as Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon. For more information, please refer to this article from SMCI and this article from Celestica.

In summary, these partnerships demonstrate NVIDIA's connectivity within the AI ecosystem. This confirms that NVIDIA is indeed the queen of the AI chessboard.

For a company with a market capitalisation of 4.22 trillion dollars, it still has significant growth opportunities, particularly in the Chinese market, which means there is much to watch for with NVIDIA. Additionally, I note that NVIDIA has an A- growth rating, as shown in the figure below. The company's expected revenue growth rate is 60.71%, while the industry median is 7.28%. Furthermore, its 3-5 year compound annual growth rate  for expected long-term earnings per share  growth is 29.09%, compared to the industry median of 14.29%. This clearly indicates the expected growth levels for certain potential AI opportunities, such as the Omniverse platform and the Chinese AI market.

Now, when it comes to valuation, the growth outlook is becoming clearer. First, when I look at the chart below, I notice that most metrics are above the industry median, indicating that the valuation is higher than the industry median. Its non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio is 40.12 times, and its forward enterprise value to EBITDA ratio is 34.79 times, both significantly higher than the industry median. However, when I look at the non-GAAP forward price-to-earnings ratio , it indicates that the valuation is undervalued by 27%. NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio is 1.38 times, while the industry median is 1.90 times. Based on the GAAP trailing 12-month PEG, the company's P/E ratio is 0.69 times, undervalued by 31% compared to the industry median. Ideally, I would say that most multiples look high in absolute terms, but compared to NVDA's 60.71% compound annual growth rate, the stock's valuation isn't as high as it appears.

In terms of peer comparison, I chose NVDA's closest competitors because Nvidia is already far ahead in terms of market capitalisation, so I chose Broadcom and AMD. I noticed that NVDA's price-to-earnings ratio and expected price-to-earnings ratio are still lower than its peers.

I believe that the biggest risk facing NVIDIA at present is geopolitical risk. Currently, there are many uncertainties between China and the United States, especially following the imposition of tariffs on Liberation Day and the U.S. government's decision to suspend exports of H20 GPUs to China. Such situations could recur and undermine NVIDIA's growth plans and market expansion efforts. Losing the Chinese market would have a significant impact on NVIDIA's business. Additionally, geopolitical events such as trade tariffs and sanctions could affect global supply or cloud computing spending in some of the key regions where NVIDIA operates. In conclusion, in this grand AI infrastructure game, NVIDIA is the queen. Currently, it is the most powerful and flexible piece on the board. Compared to peers that may occupy other key positions, NVIDIA controls every direction. For example, AMD is the rook, SMCI is the bishop, while Credo and Astera are agile knights. Ultimately, NVIDIA determines the pace and scope of this game. As AI demand continues to grow, NVIDIA's dominant position is further strengthened by the expansion of the Chinese market.
TL;DR but bullish ai slop write ups as usual The problem with Nvidia I've always had is they're still mostly a hardware company at heart though. What's the plan to transition to more of a service company and have reoccurring revenue? 

Any Nvidia bull want to answer it?

I like Jensen and think he's a smart guy though. At Jensen's CES keynote this January most of the presentation wasn't about what the hardware would do - it was what software, and in particular Nvidia's software, could enable. 

Their platforms for synthetic training data, simulation, etc. are (I presume) what they are trying to transition too. At the same time, I took away that their software accompaniment to their chips is already excellent (their platform for instance is much better than AMDs) and that they plan to keep it that way.

But you're right - that remains kind of a vague answer. That said they're definitely working on it. (And while it makes up a very small amount of revenue, they already have things like GeForce Now for gaming.) TPU is already comparable 

Custom asic is the real competition.  This means AVGO CUDA (software side) is the biggest moat, every AI researcher grew up using CUDA They will keep getting better and better hardware, they are too ahead. That’s their reoccurring revenue, the big boys will want to stay ahead, therefore constantly buying the newest and best. They’ve “caught up” in hardware already basically, yet they’re not stealing an inch of nvidia business, wonder why? They’re as capable and cheaper and still nobody is buying them…the answer is the software side (CUDA) They’re not ahead though.  Google has competitive chips at 1/10th the cost

And this is proven by not only their own industry models exclusively using it (Gemini 2.5 pro, VEO3, etc)

But also Ilya Sustkeber SSI uses them 

Absolute undeniable proof that nvidia are not needed to be at the bleeding edge. I mean they haven’t released a single earnings report under the new “caught up” hardware. You don’t think MI350 and MI400 guidance and earnings are going to prop AMD up? AMD is less than a 300B market cap company, but according to their specs their chips are faster and cheaper than Blackwell. They’re also making solid gains on the software side and actually challenging NVDA’s iron garden software mentality by making their software open source.

I own both stocks, but to me AMD has far more upside potential that isn’t currently priced into the stock. It’s gonna be MUCH easier for AMD to hit a 400B market cap (>40% return) than NVDA to hit 5T (<25%).",43,0.78,27,0,Aluseda,stocks,"['NVDA', 'GME', 'META', 'GOOGL']",nvidia continue controlling ai

1m4mw6u,2025-07-20,"Bloomberg: EU to prepare retaliation as US stance hardens
The US and the EU have less than two weeks to agree on a framework or it will be 30% across the board tariffs which will devastate many businesses. 

The EU has a powerful weapon in its fight against this economic bullying- a law called the ACI or anti Coercion instrument that gives the entire block broad powers to take retaliatory action. This can include high taxes against US Tech giants like META, curbs on US investment in the EU and more. Boeing will certainly get hit as will farmers and Bourbon makers. 

Let’s hope sanity prevails as a trade war with our democratic allies and one of the largest and wealthiest markets in the world is insanity

Well, China showed the world how to do it. Just play hardball. Signs of a dying empire. Lashing out against allies to keep the show running little longer despite the deeper fall. Still counting on TACO though. Correction: the US consumer got a 60% tariff on things from china wacked on them China still got a 60% tariffs whacked on them though... Which is why they pivoted to trade alliances with other countries, including a joint one with Korea and Japan. 

Do you realize how much China and Japan hate each other? The U.S. bungled a tariff war so bad that people with thousand year old rivalries have become best friends. 

America's position in the global economy is never recovering from this. All it did was illuminate how little the rest of the world needs the U.S. if they just work together instead. And in turn the US is under semi-official boycott in China. They won’t buy anything that’s replaceable. Just a reminder that EU is the biggest holder of the US treasuries They are the highest individual country, but once you combine the EU countries they would have more I think, Luxembourg and Belgium alone (together) seem to have about 80% as much as Japan.

1m4iovt,2025-07-20,"UNH Protective puts before earnings
Hi everyone, I have 5,200 shares of UNH @295 and i’m not very confident about the health sector lately, but I’m very confident in one year UNH can reach 350 again.

(I don’t have extensive knowledge in options)

How do you find a good option strike price/expiration for the upcoming earnings to hedge using protective puts for the upcoming earning on July 29.
If your confident it will reach 350 then why would you need puts? The iv would price in a lot of that risk in the price.


If you're that sure sell your shares and buy half strike long dated call options. Adds 50% protection and 2x multiplier. Otherwise just sit tight and collect dividends, which is the least risky thing to do if you're confident in the long term. If you don’t know anything about options and if all the Greek is Greek to you- you’ll blow up your account or risk too much money to barely make any money. 


There’s an options reddit and Wall Street Bets Reddit to learn a little bit about options, but without paper trading- you’ll never see how fast your position can go against you. Even if you were correct on which direction the stock goes, it doesn’t mean you make out like a bandit. Do a lot of research. Do a lot of paper trading. Don’t risk a lot of money. 


People have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars TRYING to do options. They didn’t understand how the Greeks screwed them in their various bets and kept making the same mistakes. Stay away. You have about $1.5M in one stock. 

If it’s part of a diversified portfolio you’re rich, and so you can hold it until it comes back and collect ~$46k/ year in dividends while you wait.

If you aren’t diversified, you could sell 30 DTE 300 calls on half and make about $26k per month in premium. If a stock price is $100 and the short term option price is $300 for the 100 strike, then volatility of going up or down 3% is already implied and priced into the option. Your betting on it being greater, but ultimately you've already pissed away 3% of your equity if it's insurance. You have one mil on the stock and asking reddit for help? Regarded Or you just hold the shares and ignores the noice as long the fundamentals looks good relative to the market cap? 1.5 million for UNH stock? I hope diversify more This guy should not buy options. But to be fair, his mindset is not wrong here at all looking besides technicalities of things like IV crushes, etc.

Options are made to be insurance. For that matter, you can ‘simply’ construct IV-neutral collars, betting on a downward direction, or partially hedge agianst an IV crush with numerous other synthetics. They have earnings and forward guidance on July 29.

1m459fh,2025-07-19,"Did the market become oversensitive?
I’m talking about the earnings of GOOG and NFLX where despite strong results the stock price fell down. Going through the details, you’ll find one or two metrics where the expectations weren’t met. Still, I feel like the market is really overreacting. Is this the new norm? 

Oh, and let’s ignore TSLA. It’s a meme stock.
First time? Am I tripping? Isn’t Google’s earnings next week? i feel like everyone’s writing about something I haven’t seen When a stock is as expensive as a NFLX, any small hiccup will bring the price down. These are already priced to perfection so pretty much no margin for error. Google is the cheapest of the mag 7 so it should have more of a leeway. OP seems new to this The trick is to kill the brand, lose sales and underperform every quarter and then make a hype post. Look at TSLA I think OP was talking about last quarter, they beat and initially pumped but then gave back their gains. They missed on cloud barely I remember. Goog is super undervalued. I mean this stock alone can fight robotaxi, nflx, msft, yet valuation is so low. Search has see no decline since release of ChatGPT though. I was reading about this this morning in either bloomberg or Financial Times. It's hard to reconcile this idea that we need gangbusters results for cash flow positive stocks like Netflix but stocks like Tesla and Carvana still exist at insane valuation metrics. How can the market be priced to perfection but Tesla can still survive despite being decimated by their earnings? Last time Alphabet beat estimates by 40%, the stock fell down.

1m3s9fm,2025-07-19,"MaxLinear (MXL) - A Return to Profitability
Hello everyone, I don’t post on Reddit often, but I felt like sharing some personal analysis I’ve been doing for a project on MaxLinear, a designer of Systems-on-Chips (SoCs).

Business: 

The company designs Systems-on-Chips for a broad range of applications. Broadband, wireless, infrastructure, and industrial/multi-market are the key segments. The technology MXL designs is sold to original equipment makers, majority of which are located in Asia. The technology is manufactured by TSMC and another company based out of Singapore (if I recall correctly). 

Semi-Shortage and the After Effects:

During the semiconductor shortage in 2020 and 2021, MXL saw a mass influx of cash, recording massive profits the company hadn’t seen before. Share value 5x’d from May of 2020 to December of 2021, peaking at around $75. Once the shortage subsided, customer inventories remained high, and MaxLinear suffered as a result, going from an EPS of $4.23 in 2022 to $1.10 in 2023 and even lower to -$0.90 in 2024. Share valued tanked, and recently hit 10 year lows in April of less than $10.

So What’s the Good News?

On Wednesday, July 23rd, the company is set to announce Q2 earnings. The expectation is an EPS of $0.02, a positive number the company hasn’t seen since 2023, and a positive free cash flow. Along with a return to profitability, the company is also scoring key design wins and deals that are going to (hopefully)have strong effects on the second half of the year, with the current Q4 EPS estimates sitting in between $0.15 and $0.22. The company’s Q1 earnings call gave very positive sentiment and signs, and I believe the company is set up for success in todays world of dependency on semiconductors.

Downsides:

The company had 10 customers account for 60% of revenue in 2024, and has been fighting some litigation over a terminated merger from a couple years ago. If the company fails to post solid numbers next week, share price will drop pretty hard, as it’s been climbing a lot since April (up over 50%). 

My Final Opinion: 

I believe that MaxLinear is undervalued, and should the company be able to record strong growth and numbers throughout the rest of the year, the company will be a solid investment for either the short or long term. With a current share value of $16.20, I believe the price will break $20 in the coming months, so long as the earnings report next Wednesday goes well enough. 

Current Position:
464 shares (~$7.5K) at an average cost basis of $14.93

I didn’t want to get too deep and bore people with numbers, but the company has a solid balance sheet and isn’t drowning in any debt. I wanted to keep this relatively short and sweet while getting enough info out there.

Best of luck and happy earnings season!!

Probably not Yes 300?  Is way too low. 300 monthly is not that much. But moreover, your picks can change outlook at any moment. You should get a better balance through mutual funds or ETFs.

You need to know how much you need to live off of per month and account for inflation on that. This also all depends on your age. Make sure you max out your IRA contributions first. Gl.

I dunno, maybe. To be fair his response is realistic. $300 a month isn’t enough unless you choose to live in a very low cost of living country like Rwanda 20 years from now.

The crowd is usually wrong. When your posts get downvoted to hell you should be thrilled. Back up the truck. Unless you are wrong then don't, ha. I'm not upset at all, more like disappointed. I made $44k off of METC, wanted people that read r/stocks to make money as well. But it's all good, I'll just drink an extra beer for you.

btw... I'm old, gen x, we don't get upset, just disappointed with kids these days. I only wish I knew about the news a week ago 😭 still a lot of potential for upside though I believe, especially if relations with China further deteriorate you mad about those down votes my man,  or you wouldn't have brought them up lol.
you can pound an extra beer for me though, hate the stuff. Welcome to r/stocks!

1m32k1f,2025-07-18,"MS Report: OpenAI Targets $700 Billion TAM by 2030 - Which Listed Companies Will Benefit?
JP Morgan just released a lengthy report stating that OpenAI's total potential market TAM could reach $700 billion by 2030, noting that it currently has 800 million monthly activations and nearly $10 billion in annualized revenues, most of which comes from subscribers. While its GPT model leadership is being eroded by competitors, consumer-side realizations and brand strength are still seen as a moat.

Points to note:

ChatGPT generates 75% of its revenue from consumer subscriptions

GPT-4 is only 95th in LM Arena, Gemini and DeepSeek are gaining in competitiveness

Estimated timeline for profitability: circa 2029

AI Infra funding (H1 2025) reaches $63 billion

Discussion topics:

Which public market stocks stand to benefit most from OpenAI's long-term expansion? Discussion topic: Which public market stocks are best positioned to benefit from OpenAI's long-term expansion? Here are a few companies I'm currently following:

$MSFT (OpenAI's largest shareholder, Azure enabler)

$NVDA (provides training and inference power)

$AMZN / $GOOGL (competitors, also building their own base models)

$CRM / $NOW: AI verticals on the ground

Should I also be looking at the A100/H100 supply chain? Or just bet on the “consumerization” of generative AI?

Holding a small number of $MSFT and $NVDA LEAPs, not financial advice.
JPMorgan pumping its own clients, nothing new here no different than the pundits trying to pump tesla fsd and ignoring any and all flaws the company and ceo has to pump their own investments. Nvidia I have a $1 trillion TAM by 2030

In theory. Its hard to tell at the moment. Everyone is investing but no one is describing a clear usecase with a valid business model. With Nvidia & TSM the only ones making huge money

They hyperscalers hould be fine, but I wouldn't venture much beyond that yet. Don't forget AMD here. Inference will be key. any sane company wouldn't put all eggs in one supplier. >GPT-4 is only 95th in LM Arena, Gemini and DeepSeek are gaining in competitiveness

LMArena is a flawed benchmark, see ""The leaderboard illusion"" paper. It does not reflect real world usage.

There is a reason ChatGPT sells way more subscriptions despite spending substantially less on marketing than competitors, and not having their own OS to push it(like Google with Android or Microsoft with Windows) Yes AMD will be a major player here. CUDA is amazing but you can’t use high compute GPUs for inference. It’s just too costly and overkill. This is what this sub is for. Excellent DD thank you!!

1m2yuwx,2025-07-18,"What are your opinion on UNH? I have leap calls but I'm not very sure if it's long enough anymore.
 I saw bunch of posts about united health being underrated along with Google and the strong resistance it has above 270s I bought 2 years out contracts after feeling confident with the earnings coming up and doing my own DD. However, as with almost all stocks, the moment I buy, it breaks trend and goes to shit. Now that elevance stock fell 10% after it's earnings, it's more than likely that UNH will not have a successful earnings either. Do you guys think the drop is already priced in or will the earnings cause another drop? Hopefully, not massive. Will I be somewhat safe because my contracts (atm) are 2 years out or should I cut losses? It being the biggest health insurer and having the highest marketshare in the country is what convinced me to go for this investment and since tech is once again hitting ath I fear health might not recover until that settles or may be not even until trump leaves which concerns me.
We're really not going to know if the market over-reacted or under-reacted until earnings come out. Sorry mate, it's just a guess at this point. Don't personally believe earnings are priced in but UNH should be more of a long term play.  Something to invest in and forget about. No one really knows right now except the CEO, maybe.

He bought a lot of shares himself last few months though.

You are going to just gambling on the July 29 earnings call, anyone who claims he knows is also just guessing. 

I threw a kitchen sink at it and bought some shares around $300. Healthcare ain't getting cheaper nor free in America. Definitely long term hold. Yea let's go ahead and buy into sector's that are full on green instead...... Perfect long term stock. I can see the stock dropping a bit lower after earnings, which would be expected imo. I bought shares at $305 and I bought a few more today. A lot of insider buys in May and no insider sells which is a good signal. I can definitely see the stock going back to its aths within the next 2~years. 

Of course this is not financial advice, just my opinion. Marjorie holding shes new pelosi No one knows.  Next 2 week will tell the story on health insurers investability.  $HUM earnings 7/25 and $UNH 7/29.  If $HUM can guide well to target and perhaps $UNH does provide some or any guidance could be a good week.   Different business models I know but related for sure. 

I am not looking to recapture ATH’s since they really benefited from no one seeing a doctor during COVID and it finally caught up with them but am very hopeful for these earnings.  

With all that said prayer is not an investment strategy yet here I find myself in end of quarter prayer mode.  I have shares as well and we can’t seem to find that bottom.   I’m selling some OTM CC’s for a bit of a cushion.   If you have a small loss and don’t want the gamble maybe cut as it could be dead money for a year or two or ride the ride.  In my experience I am holding and as such am fully prepared to get screwed next week but am also kinda hopeful in prayer mode.  Come On One time. > Buddy this shit could drop to $225 while you’re holding LEAPS that need a $300+ strike. 

sure, and a giant asteroid could wipe out the planet. neither outcome is likely. you have 2 year leaps, you don't need to worry too much about the short term. at the end of the day the drops are more vibes than reality, because the money is making money hand over fist. it will rotate back into favor and skyrocket (as we saw a tease of a few weeks ago when it jumped up to like $320 overnight.)

of course, your strike matters, but i definitely wouldn't be cutting losses.

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1m2wtuy,2025-07-18,"Uber to invest $300 million in EV maker Lucid as part of robotaxi deal
https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uber-invest-300-million-ev-maker-lucid-part-robotaxi-deal-2025-07-17/

Uber (UBER.N), opens new tab will invest $300 million in electric vehicle maker Lucid (LCID.O), opens new tab in a robotaxi deal that aims to start with one major U.S. city late next year, the companies said on Thursday.
Over six years starting in 2026, Uber will acquire and deploy over 20,000 Lucid Gravity SUVs that will be equipped with autonomous vehicle (AV) technology from startup Nuro, the three companies said in a statement.


The agreement illustrates the renewed plans and push for financing for self-driving cabs years after a first wave of autonomous driving investment produced only a limited number of vehicles. Tesla has recently launched a robotaxi trial in Austin and Alphabet's (GOOGL.O), opens new tab driverless taxi unit Waymo is speeding up its expansion.
As part of their announced deal, Uber will invest hundreds of millions of dollars in Lucid and Nuro, which supplies self-driving technology to automakers, the joint statement said. Of that, $300 million will go to Lucid, the EV maker said in a separate filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday.
Lucid shares surged more than 26% to $2.95. They have fallen about 24% this year.
Doesn’t the Uber app already let you book Waymos through them? I think the point of this deal is not to be dependent on one robotaxi company. For Uber to be the aggregator of multiple robotaxi companies. This may have been the most underwhelming news to produce a 50% pop. It's a perfectly good reason for Lucid to pop. Uber invested 300 million to put their people on the board, and they buy 20k cars (probably more if it works out). Now Uber is invested, and if Lucid runs out of money, Uber will have a good reason to keep them alive. Thats not how it works. They will eventually have to raise prices as per Waymo… no ride is affordable at 6$! The cars are expensive plus the maintaining is not cheap either. Stocks pop for the stupidest reasons. At least this is somewhat tied to the company and it’s revenue I think this is for the ultra luxury market with each loaded vehicle coming in 150k+. Not sure how long before it turns a profit It’s only a matter of time before they increase it too. 3k sounds small, but that is 2x what Waymo  and 100-300x what Tesla has currently. Both Waymo and Tesla will increase their fleets, but so far there are only 10-30 Tesla robotaxis according to quick googling. Waymo has 1500. You might want to add some years to your reminder :D

[Musk has been promising a fleet of autonomous Teslas since at least 2013. In 2019, he said there would be “a million robotaxis on the road” by 2020.

1m2h56y,2025-07-17,"Use XSP for spy options
If you're just buying direct calls/puts use xsp. It's cash settled, 60% of earnings is taxed at long term regardless of holding period. It mimics spy exactly only at 1/10th the rate for cheaper options.  Options are only a fraction of the price, cash settled, and mimics spy directly. 

The only reason you shouldn't be using it for spy options is you have larger capital or you write options since you cannot create calendar positions for example
Options on XSP are priced accordingly. I am not sure why you're saying that they're cheap.

Also, sometimes, you could land a 747 between the spread on some strikes/expiry dates. Not cheap like it's a good deal. Cheap that you can purchase atm options for a fraction of the capital. And yes same day spreads do work you are correct. But it mimics spy exactly at 1/10th the rate and ALL gains no matter how long you hold,  60% is taxed long term. If you're playing spy already and can't use spx because atm options are $1300 instead of $130. 

Previously I felt forced to go otm more on spy to be able to afford or even setup spreads. Little capital is needed for xsp If I'm playing around buying short dated contracts it won't be in roth, it'll be in a short term account. Taxes can drain you and using spx is a life saver. 

You're right. Every trade shouldn't be full port which is why xsp is great. I've used spx but only recently knew about xsp. Just letting others know. I hated having to tie a large amount of capital into a single option

1m2gp3h,2025-07-17,"What strategies do you guys use to exit/take profit on an all time high stock?
Im trying to figure out some strategies to exit a position/take profit on all time high stocks without selling and then stock keep running constantly (for example recently on MSFT and NVDA and how they just go up and right permanently at ATH lately)

  
Its obviously much easier to see support and resistance when stocks arent at all time high and can see trends and patterns in the stock price, but when its at all time high what strategies do you use to know when the trend is reversing or it may be time to sell and take all those juicy profits?

  
This is mainly directed to people who swing trade for profit and not investors who just buy and never sell. I'm looking for strategies on when you feel confident a stock has reached its top and a pretty significant down trend is starting.
Just sell right at the top. I wait till it crashes and sell then Sell covered calls and watch them get blown out as the stock goes up another 10%+ Do you think it’s a good investment? What are you going to do with the money?

Think about your portfolio:

Sell your worst ideas when you have a better idea.

Don’t sell your best ideas to fund a mediocre idea. Historically,  All Time Highs lead to more All Time Highs.

But someone said trailing stop.  This might work if the market doesn't gap down. The best strategy that everyone uses here is called, ""denial"". When it's going up, you don't buy as you think it's going down very soon. Weeks later you regret it as it's gone up 30 percent.  You wait until it's at its peak and you put all your money in it. 
It drops 10 percent the next day and you believe it's going to go back to the next day. You hold as you see it drop 50 percent. You panic and you sell. When you sell. The next day, the stock goes up 1000 percent. 
You repeat, and repeat, until you're homeless. It's just like tightening a bolt. Tighten until it breaks and the back off 1/4 turn. This. Just sell at top. And buy back on the dips.

Graphics and gaming is a minor market for them, and companies like AMD can provide better gaming GPU cards for less money. So let's talk about the AI - because then you have companies like Intel and AMD, and Google with their own TPUs and then you have China which is according to various sources maybe about 2 - 5 years behind, but ultimately trying to be able to both design and manufacture such chips too.

So:

nvidia - valued at 4.2T capable only of designing powerful compute chips, being currently most popular by AI researchers because their CUDA software stack is already widely adopted and mature

Intel - valued at \~100B capable of **both designing and manufacturing** comparably powerful compute chips - not having so mature ecosystem as CUDA - yet  
AMD - valued at \~250B capable of only designing compute chips just as powerful as nvidia, only lacking in adoption of their software stack (ROCm) that they keep improving (they already provide accelerators cards even more powerful than nvidia)

TSMC - valued at 1.2T which is manufacturing for most of chip designers, now including even Intel (partially) that nvidia is totally dependent on

Then you have companies like Google and Cerebras that design their own silicon (again depending on TSMC just as everyone else, maybe except Chinese) that make chips far more powerful than nvidia does.

So where is this insane valuation of nvidia coming from? Is it just because they have a temporary leading edge in industry that just seems to be a top of all hype?

Because in few years they could literally become irrelevant in the AI world just as Nokia became irrelevant in the mobile phone world - the competition exists, has similar products, and it's only a matter of short time until software stacks for Intel and AMD GPUs get as much adopted in LLM / AI world as CUDA is.

Can someone help me understand this valuation?
Just an analogy- Apple just designs iPhone (even their chips)… everything is build in companies like Foxconn tsm You've missed quite a few markets that they're in, to say they're only use case is gaming and ai is like seeing the very tip of the iceberg and saying that's all there is. 


Crypto, robotics, self driving cars, weapons industry, research, training, just to name a few. Good one, I think OP is missing the other factor that it sells those manufactured products, for profit. So calls? >Let that sink in - they design those chips, they don't even manufacture them.

\*shocked pikachu\*

A post worthy of wallstreetbets. You are greatly underestimating how much Nvidia is ahead in both hardware and especially the software stack. They are years ahead of AMD and Intel doesn't even matter. And they are so flush with cash the difference will only get bigger. The real threat is from clould/Ai vendors making their own chips but it is not a huge one. Irrelevant? Hahahahahahahaha, are you fucking serious? Nvda sits at a forward pe of 38. It is very expensive for sure, but far from being as disconnected as op makes it sound and very far from metrics of what have been called bubbles in the past where companies with no net income or even no tangible path towards good earnings would be valued in the top 20 of the SP500.

1m29h0v,2025-07-17,"Nvidia could recoup as much as $15 billion in revenue with H20 sales to China set to resume
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-could-recoup-as-much-as-15-billion-in-revenue-with-h20-sales-to-china-set-to-resume-100052288.html

> Nvidia (NVDA) is set to recoup billions of dollars in revenue if the tech giant resumes sales of its AI chips to China as expected after a surprise export ban in April.

> Wall Street analysts at Stifel, Bernstein, and William Blair said Nvidia could make up as much as $15 billion in revenue from China in the second half of the year to hit around $20 billion from the region for its 2026 fiscal year, which ends next January. That would be an uptick from its roughly $17 billion in sales from China in 2025.

> Nvidia said Tuesday that it had received assurances from the Trump administration that it would be granted licenses to resume sales of its H20 chips to Chinese customers, sending the stock to a new record high.

> Stifel analyst Ruben Roy raised his price target on Nvidia to $202 from $180 following the news, writing in a note to clients Tuesday that, given pent-up demand, there will ""likely be an accelerated cadence of H20 ingestion from China customers"" in the second half of the year.
Warrants a $50 trillion valuation IMO Stock went up like 200 billions on the news that they'll recoup $15 billion in revenue, right? Market seems to be ignoring that this was only approved because Huawei's recent offerings are better than the H20. To compete with Huawei, Nvidia will need to cut prices aggressively- they won't be able to sell these chips at the types of margins that they sell chips in the US.

The objective in approving these sales is to apply competitive pressure to Huawei and drive a price war so that Huawei can't grow as easily. Only if one assumes a single one time order of chip today but zero future business with China, ever, plus ignores the implied message of product and architecture endorsement that comes from seeing China apparently ascribe immense value to what Nvidia has. *450 trillion Good point. NVDA traded flat all over 2024. It makes me suspect of the movement that it's all of a sudden getting. What ever happened to the fears of the China AI system that caused NVDA to drop 30% in a few days earlier in the year? Or was that just a fake news story to drop the stock lol. Whoa now... what do you think this is, a TSLA p/e?! > The makers of Deepseek claimed they spent only $6M to develop a superior AI to any U.S. models at the time using ~2000 Nvidia A100 chips which are 5 years old.

People need to actually read about the stuff they're trying to defend... Deepseek spent far more than $6m developing their models. The $6m everyone loves to quote was the cost to train the final model that they released. Far more was spent on researching to get to that model, let alone on the hardware to get there.

Estimated costs to get them the model in question was over a billion. Well sad nobody talks about that so they only talk about the shit that makes the stock go up TSLA? Pathetic.

1m27uaf,2025-07-17,"JPMorgan bullish on HPE-Juniper synergy, but market barely reacts, why?
MS upgraded HPE to Hold and emphasized that the addition of Juniper will drive HPE's transition to a higher-margin, lower-cyclical business. But judging by the stock's performance, the market doesn't seem to be reacting much.

Is it skepticism about the execution of the integration? Or are you still concerned about weakness in the server business?

In terms of valuation, HPE is still at historic lows, and if the integration goes well, this improved profit structure should be revalued.

What do you think of this “more attractive instead of higher” scenario? Is it an opportunity in silence, or are institutions overlooking it?

Disclosure: No position.
The router/switch market is extremely saturated and their only real strategy is mist AI. Their physical products are good but so is everyone else in the industry and even before this juniper and HPE networking was having a hard time growing. You've got old reliable cisco who has prevailing ""no one gets fired buying cisco"" mentality plus arista who has probably the highest performing layer 2 switching platform.

I expect them to improve performance wise but the real question is ""is AI management of layer1/2/3 switching significant enough to take market share"".

I wasn't able to find who is providing the loan (I suspect JPMorgan)  but this entire acquisition was financed by term loans ""The transaction’s funding will be based on financing commitments for $14 billion in term loans, with repayments planned for the next two years as part of the company’s goal of reducing its leverage to approximately 2x."" Who? There just isn’t going to be a lot of movement in the networking space. Cisco has been a “dying dinosaur” since 2005, but still owns about 75% of the networking hardware market. That share will continue to go down, but we’re talking 1% a year (likely slower as Cisco staunches the bleeding with mediocre but profitable software, NVIDIA AI collab, etc.) - too long term for moves like this to create serious movement. I actually think arista is a bit overvalued right now so while I do think they will reach their ATH number I think they are limited because they exist in a space that is highly saturated with other mature companies and their stock is already outperforming their peers signficantly in ratios. "" the market doesn't seem to be reacting much.""

Upgrading something like HPE to hold is not going to generate much excitement. Nice to note the mention of Arista. How long would you think it would take to get back to its ATH levels seen in January before the Deepseek-triggered sell off? Many AI stocks have recovered since then but Arista has been lagging.  with all those companies like Rocketlab, AMD and Palantir providing 8 percent gains every week,  why invest in an unknown? Don’t worry. The activist investor from Elliot they just placed in the board will burn everything to the ground. It will have its day in the sun soon enough, it's a $40 stock.

Everyone talking about AI NVDA and how the S&P barely flinched while 90% of its components bled red this week But let break it down like a real investor not a headline chaser

 Capital Economics now sees 7,000 by end of 2026 That not hopium if you follow the earnings

This spiked massively premarket but I want to continue watching this- the black box warning is actually a positive sign because it means that it'll be allowed to stay on market despite causing patient deaths. Future risks are potential for further adverse events related to ELEVIDYS, regulatory scrutiny, typical risks when dealing with biotech.

1m26qx5,2025-07-17,"Wall Street steady again after Trump downplays threat to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's job
Wall Street appears calm after President Donald Trump walked back his earlier threats to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

Futures for the S&P 500 were unchanged before the opening bell Thursday, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2%. Nasdaq futures rose less than 0.1%, essentially flat.

Trump has harshly criticized Powell and his Fed colleagues for the decision to stand pat on interest rates at a time when the economy is broadly healthy and unemployment is low. Trump's new complaint about Powell  which he says could be grounds for firing the central bank chief  is about cost overruns on the $2.5 billion renovation project at the Fed's Washington headquarters.

Wall Street loves lower rates because they goose prices higher for stocks and other investments, and Trump himself has been clamoring for the Fed to cut more quickly. But Powell has insisted he wants to wait for more data about how Trump’s stiff tariffs will affect the economy and inflation.

Markets, as well as the dollar, took a quick dive Wednesday on reports that Trump was talking about terminating Powell, but largely recovered after he appeared to walk back those sentiments.

A number of companies early in the earnings season have been reporting strong performances, even as they cite uncertainty about the near future due to the potential impacts of Trump's tariffs.

PepsiCo shares rose 2% before the bell Thursday after the beverage and snack giant's second-quarter sales and profit topped Wall Street projections. PepsiCo reaffirmed its April guidance, which projected lower full-year profit than previous forecasts due to increased costs from tariffs and a pullback in consumer spending.

The world’s largest chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), reported huge increases in sales and profit from a year ago, sending its stock up 3.4% in early trading. However, TSMC, a major supplier for Nvidia (NVDA), warned that “uncertainties and risks from the potential impact from tariff policies exist.”

Shares of United Airlines (UAL), which reported after the bell Wednesday, dipped 1.6% overnight after the carrier's second-quarter revenue came in a touch lower than expected. United also cut its full-year profit guidance.

Also falling early Thursday are shares of Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) and Ingredion, makers of high fructose corn syrup. President Donald Trump said Wednesday that Coca-Cola has agreed to use real cane sugar in its flagship soft drink in the U.S. at his suggestion  though the company has yet to confirm that.

Ingredion tumbled almost 6% early Thursday, and Archer-Daniels-Midland fell 3%.

Netflix (NFLX) reports earnings after markets close.

I think at first it would be good, but long term it would be bad. Soooooo bad PEDOOOOO LOVERRRRR I think it's bullish if Powell steps down. It would mean lower rates. I'm not saying that's the best for the economy btw. The Fed only controls the short end of the yield curve with the fed funds rate.

1m1o6uq,2025-07-16,"OPEN's Trading Volume is Bonkers!!
OPEN stock's volume is well above Amazon and Google's combined. Not kidding. To put it into perspective, those two behemoths together are over 5000x OPEN's market cap.

Yet OPEN has traded at considerably higher volumes than those two put together the last couple of days. This isn't DD and their financials still don't look great (sure they could be the next Carvana, or it could also go to 0), but the volume alone could make a stock this small 10x in a blink. Looks like its recent 3x since late June is just ramping up (looking at chart only).

I'm not trying to pump this but I'm glad to have a tiny position and couldnt believe when I saw the volume, I've seen how quickly a small cap can moon with the collective power of the highly regarded masses fueling it.

  
Disclaimer edit: I'd opened a small speculative position after being intrigued by a fellow degen's Reddit post on it in late May. Obv now that my share are up >100% I wish I'd taken a bigger bite, but if someone else YOLOs some money in it bc they in turn saw this post, at least the degen baton has been proudly passed down. 
You need to look at dollar volume not share volume when comparing stocks. 8.8 billion dollars worth of AMZN traded today vs 400 million of OPEN. We live in a shitstock meme frenzy 

Classic late bull vibes Holy shit I can’t believe this comment is so far down. Volume is only relative It’s a meme dude. They sell houses. So what lol.

Insiders have been selling boat loads past 12 months. I looked at their balance sheet, trash imo Let’s be honest, it’s all speculation. And at this point, I’d rather just play with some money I’m okay losing to see where it goes. This one is mind boggling for me. They completely lost their ass the last few years flipping homes in my market. I'm an appraiser and every week I see at least one OD home. Bought for 400k, sat on the market over priced for 2-3x the normal days on market, and then sold for 410k with 13k in seller paid concessions. Idk how they are making any money. Maybe they have gotten better or are getting better. I work in a very hot market so I can't imagine they are doing much better in other markets. Idk man. It more than doubled in the last 10 days.

1m1c201,2025-07-16,"Anyone sold small lots on the way up?
Over the past month I sold tiny lots (tax sheltered) whenever some stock reached ATH (MSFT, AVGO, NVDA, PLTR...) because I learned the lesson with TSLA which plunged from 400 to 100ish while I held it. But now the stocks just get higher and higher, and I wish I didn't sell, even though I only sold small portions. Have you all just been holding or even buying more?

(P.S. I did buy back a little when the prices retracted a little)
[deleted] It depends.    My philosophy is ""Buy and Hold"".   However, if a stock raises sharply (or some underlying fundamentals drop sharply) and the current price is clearly overvalued, I might trim a little and use this cash to purchase other stocks with better potential returns.   


I don't do it lightly and am definitely not a swing-trader.   I guess I'm a Value Investor that is not afraid to pick the occasional ripe berry off of the bush.  


Example ... I have a trim marker set for AVGO today.   I will trim 5% of my holdings.  ...  Looking to invest in some housing related stocks ...  If a plant is growing really, really well, you might want to prune a bit of it. Makes total sense. You don't sell completely out of your winners, because in the long run you're going to really regret that, but pruning a little around the edges? Makes all the sense in the world. Especially when nobody knows when the next huge market downturn is going to happen.

If a massive downturn happens out of the blue, you'll think... 

*""Man, it was a good thing I trimmed my huge winners a little bit before the free fall happened""*. Don't beat yourself up over it.

Almost every decision you make in the stock market could have gone the other way. So you can't get too depressed, nor too hyped over what's going on. You have to just do the best you can do.

My strategy is that I will set a sell target and as a stock approaches my sell target, I might readjust based on the ""vibe"" of the overall market.

Also, even if I do reach my price target, I normally will start off selling a 20 percent position. So, I will still have 4/5ths of my original position.

But as an example, NVDA is one of my 3 biggest holdings, and my sell target for awhile has been $180.

However, due to the current ""vibe"" of the market around AI and semiconductors specifically, I've adjusted my sell target to $186.

If NVDA hits $186, then I will sell off 20 percent of my holdings.

At that point, I will wait for another 10 percent of appreciation before selling 10 percent of it. So, every time a stock pops another 10 percent after my initial sell point, I will sell 10 percent of the remaining shares. I will just keep doing that until the entire position is liquidated (which normally would be unlikely, because there will definitely be a pull back at some point)

Also, if I end up liquidating huge chunks of my portfolio, and then those stocks go on to double and triple, oh well... cry me a river. We can't predict the future. Just do the best you can. Dry your tears with all your tendies. Yes Not yet but I'm about to trim many positions to throw the cash on my car loan. Just set a bunch of stop loss orders so if it tanks I sell but if it keeps going up I'll adjust the stop price accordingly  Msft, avgo, nvda is long term hold.

Tsla is short term gamble. I have multiple accounts.  So in the actual main accounts.  It's buy and hold, readjust annually.

In the ""daytrader"" lite account, options, swing trading, candle sticks, golden cross, etc.

They serve their purposes.  I can't really say the active account ""makes"" more money either because there's so much activity...and taxes. Every time PLTR has a weird, surging ATH, I sell $1k worth. Because I actually spend my money from time to time. The best part is I have to sell less and less each time.

I don't remember being this amused in quite some time. Did he really just taco out of firing Powell lol What’s worst of all is that even if Powell is safe, the credibility of the institution is now damaged. Especially since the next Chair will be a politicized crony. 

Then the only way to regain that credibility is to defy the President. Which will simply lead to additional pressure.

1m10uo0,2025-07-16,"Where would you invest $1.2 million for the next 10+ years?
I've been contemplating investing ~1 million usd in the following stocks, for the next 10-15 years, and potentially hold longer. 

- NVDA: 50% 
- MSFT: 30% 
- AMZ: 20% 

I have considered ETFs but not aggressive enough. 

The predominant investment into NVDA is largely attributed to the increase of MCP servers and AI integration into IOT & Robotics. 

My Background: novice investor, work for 2T+ high tech company. 
At these levels of money, just buy an ETF and use rhe dividend to pay your mortgage.

Leave 10x growth hunting to those trying to get there who knows where NVDA will be in 10 years.....here food for though.  Nvidia was a 83 billion dollar company in 2018 and Intel was a 215 billion.  Today Nvidia is a 4 trillion dollar market cap and Intel is a 99 billion dollar. 

In tech companies 10 years is a long time and practically a life time in semiconductor companies. $1mm across three companies in a single sector is not really “medium to high risk”.   Why would you put all of your eggs in one basket? Your income and net worth tied up in the same single industry is not a good idea. Although it seems like it, tech will not dominate for forever and at $1.2 million it’s more about wealth preservation than making risky trades for higher returns. Hire a fiduciary financial advisor and call it a day because this risk level would make it REALLY hard to sleep at night if anything were to happen to the tech industry. There was a time when Intel was so dominant that no one ever predicted it would end up where it is today.  I've been telling my friends and family that Intel is inept for the last twenty years.   They completely missed the mobile comm chip explosion by Apple/Samsung.   Now they're going to win in AI?   Hahahaha

NVDA is in exactly that time now.   The competition in technology is so intense that one has to anticipate that NVDA's rivals will eventually have a breakthrough.   Smaller rival chipmakers to Intel beat them for mobile, I will not be surprised if the same happens to NVDA someday.  Not right now, however. lol oh do you? Very risky but no question those are good stocks.  It's just way too concentrated for me. Lol do it, i double dare you. Unpopular opinion but investing 50% of net worth in the most highly valued stock on the planet near its all time highs is not a great idea. I'd personally rather buy FXAIX for the diversification and/or Berkshire stock because its down quite a bit but still a fantastic company. I'm not convinced NVDA will be as valuable in 10-15 years once other companies catch up to them, many big tech companies are already starting to make their own chips too, so maybe their moat lasts another 3-5 years.

1m0y5ek,2025-07-16,"Trump Says Drug Tariffs Probable by Aug. 1, Downplays More Deals
>President Donald Trump said that he was likely to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals as soon as the end of the month and that levies on semiconductors could come soon as well, suggesting that those import taxes could hit alongside broad “reciprocal” rates set for implementation on Aug. 1.

>

>“Probably at the end of the month, and we’re going to start off with a low tariff and give the pharmaceutical companies a year or so to build, and then we’re going to make it a very high tariff,” Trump told reporters Tuesday as he returned to Washington after attending an artificial intelligence summit in Pittsburgh.

>

>Trump also said his timeline for implementing tariffs on semiconductors was “similar” and that it was “less complicated” to impose levies on chips, without providing additional detail.

>

>At a Cabinet meeting earlier this month, Trump said he planned to impose a 50% tariff on copper in the coming weeks, and that he expected pharmaceutical tariffs to grow as high as 200% after giving companies a year to bring manufacturing back to the US. Trump has already announced investigations under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 on drugs, arguing a flood of foreign imports was threatening national security.

>

>Still, any tariffs could immediately impact drugmakers like Eli Lilly & Co., Merck & Co. and Pfizer Inc. that produce drugs overseas - and risks driving up costs for US consumers. So does Trump’s plans for semiconductor tariffs, which are expected to hit not only the chips themselves but popular products like Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronic Co Ltd. laptops and smartphones.

>

>The threat came as Trump in recent days has sent letters to a number of trading partners unilaterally dictating the rates for tariffs on many imports - while maintaining he would continue to carry out negotiations. Earlier Tuesday, Trump announced an agreement with Indonesia reducing the 32% rate announced in one of the letters to 19%. Indonesia agreed to purchase $15 billion in US energy, $4.5 billion worth of agricultural products and 50 Boeing Co. jets as part of the agreement, the US said.

>

>Trump on Tuesday predicted that he could strike “two or three” trade deals with countries before implementing his so-called reciprocal tariffs before they are implemented on Aug. 1, saying that an agreement with India was among the most likely.

>

>Trump told reporters the US was engaged in substantive discussions with between five and six countries, but that he wasn’t necessarily inclined to finalize agreements over simply dictating a tariff rate.

>

>“I would say India, and we have a couple of others, but I have to tell you, for the most part, I’m very happy with the letters,” Trump said.

>

>The president also said that he was likely to impose a standard tariff of “probably a little over 10%” on smaller countries that did not receive tailored rates.

>

>Earlier Tuesday, Trump said representatives from the European Union - which faces a 30% tariff - would be meeting with US negotiators this week. After returning from Pittsburgh, Trump said that while some countries had indicated a willingness to “open” trade after his threats - including South Korea - others, like Japan, had not.

>

>Trump also dismissed concerns that his threat earlier in the week to impose “secondary” tariffs on Russian trading partners if Moscow did not agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine could impact US consumers, even as experts warned the president risked driving up energy costs with his plan.

>

>“I don’t think so. I think that whole thing is going to go away,” Trump said.

Good thing it only takes a few months to build an entire factory to produce pharmaceuticals, so generous to give them a whole YEAR! lol just when you think it can’t get worst for the WORSE performing sector.

1m0iwze,2025-07-15,"PMorgan beats expectations in Q2 despite lower income – market volatility helps trading desk
Just read JPMorgan’s Q2 results: net revenue dropped 10% YoY to $45.7B (still beat estimates), and net income fell 17% to $15B. EPS came in at $5.24, beating Bloomberg consensus of $4.47.

Interesting points:

Last year’s quarter had a one-off $7.9B gain from Visa shares, so the drop looks worse than it really is.

CEO Jamie Dimon highlighted strong CET1 capital ratio at 15% – “well above requirements.”

Net interest income guidance was raised to $955B for FY25 (previously $945B).

Dimon noted U.S. economic resilience but warned about tariffs, geopolitics, deficits, and asset bubbles.

**Disclosure:** I don’t currently hold JPM, just watching from the sidelines.

1m0he5b,2025-07-15,"NVDA eyes fresh highs as China sales may resume
Looks like NVDA is back in the headlines (when is it not?)  this time with a shot at reclaiming lost ground in China

After months of silence and billions in lost revenue, Nvidia just said it's applying to resume sales of its H20 AI chips in China. The US government apparently ""assured"" them that licenses will be granted  which, if true, is a massive shift from the strict bans we saw earlier this year. Shares are ripping in premarket

What’s wild is that this comes just weeks after Jensen Huang met with Trump. Now he's in Beijing for a media briefing. Coincidence? Maybe. But the timing feels... calculated

Also worth noting: AMD is jumping too, riding Nvidia’s coattails and signaling that it might get the same green light. So maybe Washington's stance on AI chips to China is softening a bit?

Of course, even if deliveries resume, it’s unlikely to impact Nvidia’s current quarter much  too little time left. But if they can get chips flowing in Q3 and Q4, that’s a whole different story

Nvidia was already on a tear after breaking that $4T milestone, and now this could add more fuel. If they can recapture even part of that China demand, it could be another big leg up  Does this feel like a short-term bump, or a full-on policy pivot that could open the floodgates again?
A 38x forward PE is 'extremely overvalued' ... I mean kinda yes but that's entire S&P500 right now.  Its not really a big outlier.

TSLA is extremely overvalued, lol.  NVDA is...  I dunno man, its not totally crazy with their continued growth. > I think it's extremely overvalued!

Based on what metrics?  NVDA's financials are so pristine you could hang their balance sheet on the wall of the Louvre. PE right now is 54.99 according to Yahoo finance. They are the best but I feel like another Apple moment when everyone thought they were the only electronic manufacturer in the world 😂 It’s quite literally trading at fair value estimates now. “Extremely overvalued” is a massive exaggeration But the market doesn't see it that way 5T before the end of the year.

1m0ha4x,2025-07-15,"(07/15) Chip Restrictions Lifted?! - Interesting Stocks Today
This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [US CPI Report For June](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-07-15/us-cpi-report-for-june?srnd=homepage-americas)

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)/AMD- NVDA/AMD is now allowed to sell its previously restricted H20/MI308 chips to China after gaining U.S. government approval. This reopens a major demand pipeline and removes a significant geopolitical overhang, boosting investor sentiment around long-term growth prospects. NVDA has hit ATH from this, I'm more interested in AMD today as a trade though just because it's run down compared to NVDA, but I'm interested in seeing if NVDA can break $170. The export clearance marks a shift in U.S. posture toward China and semiconductors and the AI race, suggesting trade tensions are entering a more flexible phase and all that money Jensen ""donated"" to Trump is paying off. This benefits high-end chipmakers, namely AMD/NVDA the most.

[**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)/KC/FXI/all Chinese stocks- The chip export announcement has been interpreted as Trump easing his stance on China, sparking a rally across most Chinese equities. BABA was up nearly 6% premarket, and I'm mainly interested in seeing if we can break daily highs in BABA today, other than that I'm also watching KC, a Chinese datacenter stock. Main risk is that Trump reverses his stance- the TACO trade can cut both ways.

[**MP (MP Materials)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MP&p=d)\- The Department of Defense agreed to buy $400M in MP's newly issued preferred stock, taking a 15% stake in the company last week. AAPL is expected to announce a $500M commitment to MP, signaling ""deepening partnerships to localize critical rare-earth supply chains"" (this was announced on FOX news). I doubt this will make as big a spike as the DOD investment because we're so far up already, so not too interested in this stock today, but still worth writing about.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

UBER and CRM are nowhere near this mag12. I'm still very bullish on UBER regardless, its my biggest holding and i think it has a lot to grow Broadcom one of the most overlooked companies for decades which has similar performance and didn’t really get hype until the AI trade. But what’s even more explosive is their VMware acquisition which pretty much doubled their revenue in a single year.

Netflix because it was a blue chip which fell out of favor but has executed well and got back into the markets good graces. FAANG was always a better acronym than Mag7.

I would take Tesla out, add these two. Each of these 8 companies actually make consistent cash flows, Tesla stock has done well but the company earning and FCF are not up to the same consistent standard. The Mag 7 are the top companies not ones chosen willy-nilly from the usual bagholders. A Mag 12 would be the top 12 companies of the S&P500, nothing else.

1lzou4i,2025-07-14,"AI is overvalued
I am going to preface this with the fact I have worked in the AI field with some big companies for about 10 years now and understand everything about AI and how it works. 

I think a AI bubble is here, we are overvalueing every company that seems to use AI for the sole reason that it uses AI. We are creating a bubble of artificial valuation. AI has many uses and I do believe we will continue using it in the future, but that does not mean it is now the most powerful market indicator. The value of AI companies should be based on the integration value. Why does every AI company hit huge numbers shortly after the launch. It makes no sense. The whole point of valuation is how much shareholder value can they provide and with many of these new companies that number is real low. We are throwing money at these useless AI companies for absolutely no reason. We can look at a example of OpenAI. They are at the cutting edge of LLM  technology. It is never going to become the next ""Google"" and while I do think it is amazing what they do and I use Chatgpt often, why does everyone say they are undervalued. It isn't a trillion dollar company. That is just one dumb example though. The real overvaluation is the 75% of AI companies that are truly useless. We will always use AI in the future as a society, but it won't be a million companies, it will be the best of the best that we use for everything. 

There are countless AI companies that all think because they use AI they are the future, and we do fall for it. I think that in the near future there will be a AI burst. The bubble will finally collapse, it will hit everyone harder than we would ever expect. I have no idea when its going to happen, could be this year, could be next, and could be in 5 years. The overvaluation of AI is at least 50% artificial. 

Shorting AI might sound stupid, and it could be I am totally wrong, but what if I am right. 

Edit: I am not talking about the big hitters in the AI industry. The OpenAI, Palantir, Nvidia are all huge and extremely impactful. I am solely saying these are the companies that will survive. They are so ahead of everyone else that in 1 day they can teach a model to do virtually anything. Other companies will be forced to die out. This is just my prediction for the future of AI. 
“I understand EVERYTHING about AI”

Sure boss You lost me at “understand everything about AI and how it works”.

Nah, you don’t.

But hey - short away. AI is only going to get more and more crazy imo, calls Trimming exposure at these insane valuations is sensible and wise.

1lzntu4,2025-07-14,"The future of film. Netflix or some other company?
Netflix has announced that they will begin showing AI generated ads in 2026. It's pretty clear what happens from there. What starts as 15-30 second AI-generated advertisements shown in the middle of your favorite TV series eventually evolves into 40-50 minute AI-generated episodes that *become* your new favorite TV series.

At some point in the not too distant future, and perhaps sooner than you think, the major streaming platforms will start rolling out feature-length films and TV series created entirely with AI. Over time, the quality will improve to be indistinguishable from real life.

The future of film is not in big budget productions with a cast of A-list stars. The future of film is in AI-generated content, created for pennies on the dollar and with very few human actors. Movies and series will be produced not over several months or years on set at some studio in Hollywood but in a few days or hours from who knows where. Like Bibles with the introduction of the printing press, they'll be produced in the thousands.

And companies can limit their exposure to risk by shifting to an On Demand model. Sure, there will be established franchises like Marvel and Star Wars and others they'll keep dishing out, but long gone will be the days when a studio drops $150M on a movie that flops.

Because the future of film won't be just Netflix Original content (or another company's), much of it will be *your* content. You'll have the power of Gen AI at your fingertips.

It won't be long until you can log into Netflix or another platform, and with a simple prompt or a choice of a few options, generate an entire film or TV series that you can watch that day and share with your friends. User content will be circulated and rated like your aunt's potato salad recipe on Allrecipes.com.

Movies are inherently procedural. Every story, at least a decent one, has:

* Structure (Freytag's pyramid, Three-act Play, The Hero's Journey, etc)
* Plot (Rags to Riches, Overcoming the Monster, Comedy, Tragedy, and Rebirth, etc)
* Theme (Love, Good vs Evil, Coming of Age, etc)
* Tone (Serious, Uplifting, Bleak, etc)
* Conflict (Man vs Man, Man vs Society, Man vs Nature, etc)
* Characters (Humans, Elves, Demons, Robots, Zombies, etc)
* Setting (Present Day, Apocalyptic, Alternate Dimension, Mars, etc)

You'll be able mix and match all of these elements and generate a prompt. BOOM - you have a new film or TV series that you'll be the first to view. Give it a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and Netflix will learn from your prompt and produce better recipes tailored just for you. You'll be able to share it with your friends on Netflix too. Top rated user content will be owned by Netflix who can sell it or rent it. Maybe they'll give you a percentage of the profit.

If you want a franchise with 20 movies, you'll have it. If you want TV series with 50 seasons, you'll have it.

So, what could the future look like?

Netflix has a current market cap of $529B with subscriptions priced between $7.99 and $24.99/mo. It's not unrealistic to double, triple, or even quadruple these costs to provide what I just described. As a millennial, I remember paying $70ish for cable 10-15 years ago. You have to believe people will be willing to pay a similar cost for On Demand film.

Is it unrealistic to forecast Netflix with a market cap of $2T?

Perhaps it's Google (Alphabet), not Netflix who will capitalize on this - and they won't just stick to movies and series. They'll evolve YouTube into a Generative AI hub. Create film, series, vlogs, and more. Veo3 is impressive. How much more capable will it be in 10 years?

If Nvidia is building ""AI factories"" to produce off-the-shelf AI models, then on-demand AI film is not so far fetched.

They say Tom Cruise saved Hollywood with Top Gun 2. I believe he only bought them a bit of extra time.
back in the day, it was hard to make movies.

then, people starting making acclaimed movies with camcorders and shit.

then everyone had a camera in their hands. people starting making movies with iphones and even much worse phones. and some of it was decent content.

The tech unleashed the creativity of people who had no access before to pro gear, or didn't have the technical skills. until they had a phone where you push a button to start recording.

the software? all open source. any fool with about zero dollars suddenly could have a decent, maybe even pro-quality editing software.

nowadays you have professional 3d animating tools that anyone can download for zero dollars.

look at the average writing on Netflix... not the best. sure you may have squid games first season, but you have tons of trash along with it like a 10th grader wrote it.

if we really take this to the final conclusion, what does it look like?

Consider the bored people who build Harry Potter in Minecraft. I claim that some pro designers you hire for $10 million couldn't make it as good as the best of those people.

so a dude out there, if they have the dedication, may one day make an entire movie with the help of AI, maybe even live action, and if they are the type that work on something for 10 years, the best of these folks can easily be better than anything Netflix can come up with.

in 50 years, netflix may no longer exist. it may be a holding company of scraps and bags. Netflix / YouTube duopoly You’re making me sad 😢 The fact that you even feel the need to ask this shows how fucked we are and probably how bullish this is The problem is quality only gets you so far. People want quantity too. This is a major reason why Netflix obliterated everyone in the streaming wars. People just want to consume content. Just look at how people scroll on TikTok and instagram and consume content. You have to do quality content and quantity content to win in the streaming wars imo.

Even if you have one mega hit show. It’s like cool, say I binge in it a day or two. What else do you have? If you don’t have anything else. I’m going to leave your platform. If these other companies actually want to compete against Netflix and YouTube. They’re gonna have to pump out content constantly to take these two juggernauts on imo. I won’t purposefully watch anything with AI in it. I don’t understand why anyone would want to watch anything made by AI. Even pictures and videos people share edited with AI just look so inauthentic. 

I feel like I’ve finally gotten to the point in my life where I can say “I’m old” lol. i'm talking about tools that haven't been invented yet.

you need to consider that software is getting better every year, and it's also getting cheaper every year.

once anime becomes easy to make with AI tools, sites even like Webtoons can have user-uploaded anime with profit sharing.

1lzmzfo,2025-07-14,"EU issues tough warning of countermeasures if US-EU trade talks break down - will markets falter?
Background Sorting: 

Trade tensions between the US and Europe have heated up again over the past two weeks. Despite the departure of the Biden administration, Trump reinstated some of the tariffs on Europe prior to his campaign, particularly related to automobiles, precision manufacturing equipment and green energy products.

Today, EU Vice-President Sefcovic made it clear that if negotiations fail, the EU will not hesitate to take reciprocal countermeasures, including imposing tariffs or limits on U.S. high-tech products, cloud services and chip equipment.

Short-term market judgment: 

If the US-EU talks continue to stall, it will weigh on large-cap tech stocks in the short- to medium-term, especially for companies with high international revenue share (e.g., NVDA, AAPL, AMD).

However, if positive signals of progress in negotiations can be released later this week, the market will repair quickly.

The current rise in volatility expectations for August in the options market suggests that institutions are already hedging their bets against conflicting risks.

My strategy (not a recommendation): 

Lightly hold tech ETFs (e.g. QQQ) and closely monitor the EU response meeting on 7/16 

If conflict escalates, plan to buy short-term defensive ETFs (e.g. XLU / SH) if the VIX breaks 15+ 

Watch for shifts in international stances during the Biden and Trump campaigns, as the policy set-ups will influence the direction of capital allocation in Sept.

What do our Reddit friends think?

Do you think the EU will really do something to counter it, or is it just a bargaining chip?

How will the escalation of the U.S.-EU trade war affect your holdings (especially tech stocks)?

How do you plan to hedge your bets if things continue to deteriorate?
I don’t think markets will have any reaction until tariffs are officially put into place. No one believes Trump is going to go through with it. At this point I expect the markets will continue to go up until something critical breaks. What that is, who knows!

I have reallocated a bit away from the US to diversify because if shit hits the fan in the US it’ll hit hard, but in the meantime I’ll take the ridiculous nonsensical gains. No point in even trying to trade on tariffs. Its a magic 8ball fiscal policy. Markets won’t falter, TACO is why China tariffs are at 54%. And copper is increased to 50% in addition to steel and aluminum being at 50%. Two of the three trade deals has kept close to April second levels. Why wouldn’t the rest of them be the same? Nobody is selling because tech earnings are around the corner, and they will be an absolute blast. All time high incoming The market has gone up a lot in the last few months. At some point there will be a correction, but would not surprise me if it's just a needed correction from the market getting a bit ahead of itself into earnings season.

It's good to pay attention to headlines. This sub has spent much of this year thinking that *every. single. headline.* is 110% going to happen tomorrow and cause some degree of market crisis and that hasn't served this sub well.

Find great companies, buy them when the market is down materially, trim a little if the market gets ahead of itself too quickly. Keep long-term winners to some degree rather than endlessly trading one's portfolio off of every headline and needlessly making investing far more stressful than it needs to be. 

""How will the escalation of the U.S.-EU trade war affect your holdings (especially tech stocks)?""

Not changing anything because of it. 

""How do you plan to hedge your bets if things continue to deteriorate?""

Have things started to deteriorate in the market? SPY is up 7% YTD/not far off all time highs and anyone even mildly diversified internationally is probably doing at least moderately better than that. People keep saying this but tariffs are in effect no? 10% on everywhere. Well now 20% on Vietnam and 30% on China. 50% now on steel and aluminum, 25% on auto and auto parts. 25% on non USMCA goods entering from Canada or Europe.

1lzmave,2025-07-14,"Stocks Rise, Trump Speaks Out, Cryptocurrencies Surge - What Happened Today?
Folks, it's been another restless Monday.
Just before the U.S. stock market opens, several key stocks and sectors are getting restless:

Top U.S. Stocks Pre-Market Movers for July 14th:

Tesla (TSLA) up over 1% 

Boeing (BA) also up about 1% 

Cryptocurrency Concepts Are Taking Off 

Azure (NIO) surges about 5% as new energy vehicles heat up again 

Meanwhile, Trump is on Truth Social again: the Nasdaq, tech, industrials - all at record highs. Cryptocurrencies are going crazy. The Fed should cut rates immediately. Inflation? Doesn't exist!

Three major thrusts behind today's market rally:

Positive macro data 

CPI inflation data released last week came in at 3.2% (y/y), which was lower than market expectations 

Markets are starting to bet that the Fed may cut rates sooner 

US bond yields have come down (10-year Treasuries are currently around 3.84%) 

Trump's statements have heated up expectations 

He has publicly called for an “immediate cut in interest rates” 

said. “He's the reason the market is at record highs” 

Whether you agree or not, the market loves any dovish (rate cut) signal, even if it's a political shout 

Hot Sectors Rotate 

Cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin back above $83,000, Ether follows 

→ COIN, MSTR, MARA and other related stocks all in the red pre-market 

New Energy Vehicles. NIO leads the way, TSLA steady - may be related to China stimulus and rumors of lower battery costs 

INDUSTRY & AEROSPACE: Boeing shines as it benefits from defense export expectations and capital rotation

Three things I'm watching this week:

Earnings season is here: tech giants start announcing earnings this week, will it continue to push the market higher or be a head-scratcher?

Fed officials statement: will they make a hawkish counterattack to the “Trump-style rate cut shouts”?

Sector rotation risk: will AI, tech stocks top out? Is money flowing into crypto, industrials, energy?

What do you think:

Will you get on board with this Trump wave? Or are you ready to reverse course?

NIO Is it for real this time or just another high and low?

Does anyone else feel like this scenario resembles the eve of that early 2020's bull market?
Where did you get CPI data? As far as I can tell, that comes out this week.

Also, where are you pulling treasury yields from?
CNBC shows the 10yr up today, currently 4.429%.

https://www.cnbc.com/bonds/ This is copy paste from 2024? Bring on stagflation. It’s unreal how dumb 🥭 and his base is regarding tariffs and how they are a tax on the consumer What market rally?

1lzae9b,2025-07-14,"Musk Suggests Tesla Shareholders Will Vote on xAI Investment
>Tesla Inc. plans to poll shareholders on whether to invest in xAI, Elon Musk said after the Wall Street Journal reported SpaceX was prepared to funnel $2 billion into the Grok chatbot developer.

>

>The billionaire entrepreneur, responding to a post on X, said any decision to back the startup ultimately wasn’t his to make. Musk asked X users publicly last year if Tesla should invest $5 billion in xAI, writing at the time that he was just testing the waters. But he said then that the EV maker’s board and backers would need to green-light such a decision.

>Musk set up xAI in early 2023, months after OpenAI ushered in the AI boom with the launch of ChatGPT. It’s since merged with the social media service X in a deal Musk said valued the AI startup at $80 billion and the social network company at $33 billion.

>

>The potential investments emerged as the combined entity XAI Holdings engages in talks to raise money at a valuation of as much as $200 billion, Bloomberg News has reported. They suggest Tesla’s billionaire chief executive officer is seeking to more closely entwine the various parts of his corporate empire.

>

>This month, the CEO revealed Tesla will adopt Grok within vehicles - days after the bot posted antisemitic content on X. The integration suggests an expanded relationship between the two firms, something some Tesla investors have called for as EV sales have slumped.

>

>Tesla disclosed in April that xAI was a customer last year, with the startup incurring $198.3 million of expenses tied to commercial, consulting and support agreements with the carmaker. The bulk of that business - $191 million - involved xAI purchasing Tesla’s utility-scale energy storage batteries, called Megapack.

It’s Solar City, again and again. Massive dilution for Tesla shareholders 

Elon owns 75%+ of xAI. So he directly gets cash infusion

Remember that he diverted GPUs from Tesla AI to xAI because he was angry his pay package got canceled. He gets to regain ownership and full control of Tesla this way, through dilution of Tesla stock into his solely owned xAI. US Steel is done. The X ticker is available. I know Musk wants that ticker like a dog wants a toy rabbit doll stuffed with peanut butter. 


He's moving soon. Towards the big holding company.  Remember when shareholders approved his giant compensation package under threat that he would develop AI outside of Tesla… then he did it anyway xAI - is the the same AI that was calling itself mecha hitler last week? What possible future does that have I have a feeling xAI is running out of money PonxAI Sxheme Electricity and chips are expensive. Elon needs more investment.

I don't like this deal. xAi inherited 13 billions dollars of debt when it absorbed Twitter. The debt was from the financing used to fund the acquisition of Twitter. 

Elon is now asking Tesla shareholders to injection more  cash into xAi. xAi is burdened by the annual 1 billion dollars of interest it has to pay out each year and Grok is a money losing machine. 

Elon is making Tesla subsidize a money losing operation, when Tesla is already struggling due to falling demand for it's electric vehicles.

1lz81rw,2025-07-14,"Prime Day 2025 U.S. retailers drove $24.1 billion in online spend, up 30.3% from 2024, according to new data from Adobe
July 12 (Reuters) - Online spending soared $24.1 billion across U.S. retailers during the stretch from July 8 to 11 – dubbed ""Black Friday in Summer"", outpacing Adobe Analytics' prior forecast, as eager shoppers rushed to snap up deep discounts on back-to-school essentials.  
  
Retailers recorded online sales growth of 30.3% during events that included Amazon Prime Day, Adobe said on Saturday, compared with [its projections of ](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-prime-day-set-lift-us-online-sales-238-billion-adobe-estimates-2025-07-07/)28.4%.

Online retail sales in the U.S. rose 11% to [$14.2 billion a year ago](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-prime-day-boosts-us-online-sales-142-bln-adobe-says-2024-07-18/).The Prime Day event has also been cemented as a ""back-to-school"" shopping moment, as consumers jumped on early deals to stock up on essentials and get ahead of the back-to-school rush, Adobe said.

Several major retailers including e-commerce giant [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) [(AMZN.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/AMZN.O), Walmart [(WMT.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/WMT.N), Target [(TGT.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/TGT.N) as well as Best Buy [(BBY.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/BBY.N) have been launching deal events with strong discounts, encouraging shoppers to trade up on expensive items they might normally pass on.

[Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) extended its sales window to 96 hours, up from the typical 48, featuring aggressive promotions on categories ranging from apparel to electronics.

A wave of enticing deals comes at a time when heightened trade tensions amid the Trump administration's volatile tariff policies have rattled consumers and businesses, and as the new August 1 deadline for countries to renegotiate trade agreements with the United States looms.

According to the report, shopping on mobile was the dominant transaction channel during the Prime Day event, driving 53.2% of online sales, above Adobe's forecast of 52.5%.

According to Adobe, overall discounts across U.S. retailers were between 11% and 24%, compared with the prior forecast range of 10% to 24%.Apparel had the biggest deals at 24%, compared with 20% last year, while electronics were at 23%, similar to last year.

[https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/us-online-spending-surges-241-billion-steep-discounts-boost-sales-adobe-says-2025-07-12/](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/us-online-spending-surges-241-billion-steep-discounts-boost-sales-adobe-says-2025-07-12/)
They got 7.2B a day last year and $6B a day this year. Not sure what normal rate of sales is. I looked at the prime day deals... They weren't even that good. Most things were cheaper before when I checked the price history. 4 days this year. 2 last year Holy moving goal posts Batman They doubled the length of the event and sales only went up 30%.

Is this supposed to be a good thing for Amazon? Considering it probably costs them little to nothing extra to just run the event longer, seems like a win. Next year - Prime week and it will be an entire month. I had a list of 15 items, only 4 had actual lower prices.

All the other ones either had coupons before and now matched the price to that, or repeated deals that happen every few weeks. 

If you were looking for Amazon devices etc then it was a good time to buy. But it also means you should really not buy any such devices outside of Prime days and black friday. And reddit tried to say it was flopping this year signaling a recession. Always inverse reddit.

1lz484q,2025-07-13,"From Boarding Pass to Cash Stack: $YOU’s Identity Play Has Legs
What's up my fellow midcap misfits! Today I bring to your attention the airport fast lane turned public equity: Clear Secure

**Ticker:** $YOU

**$$$ Scroll to the end if you want the ADHD Portfolio Manager's Cliff Notes $$$**

YOU has been quietly cashing checks while everyone's been distracted by NVDA vs. ARM cage matches. Im talking real profits, government-grade access, and a fat pile of cash. The cherry on top? They're pivoting into a another revenue stream. They have a B2B SaaS expansion plan that (might) just take them from TSA side hustle to enterprise verification empire.

**So who is YOU anyway?**

Clear Secure is the company behind those VIP ""skip the line"" biometric lanes in airports, stadiums, and other big venues. It's the TSA PreCheck if TSA actually moved at human speed. They call it Clear Plus, and it's already used by 30M+ people.

Then there's the revenue pivot... CLEAR1, a B2B identity verification platform. Think: LinkedIn, Uber, and even T-Mobile using Clear tech to make sure users/employees aren't bots or stolen IDs. IF that hits? You're looking at a low-key SaaS transformation.

**Lets talk money**

* FCF margins: 40%+
* GAAP profitable with net income up 6x YoY
* Zero debt, $1.3 billie in cash (if you did the math then yes... That's $9-10/share just sitting there)
* And they're buying back shares AND paying a dividend like a grown up (isnt that cute)

**What can send this thing on the next flight to the moon?**

* CLEAR1 traction. Need some proof of concept? They just inked 20+ enterprise deals. $TMUS already live
* Index inclusion or analyst upgrades
* Expansion into new airports/stadiums/venues... aka more sticky skip the line subscribers trying to cut you in line (dont we love those guys...)

**No Risk No Reward am I right?**

Risks include:

* If CLEAR1 fizzles and ends up being a LinkedIn footnote
* Leadership shakeup (founder/CFO stepped down recently)
* Some political grandstanding kills airport access

**Is it a good risk reward profile?**

* Floor: Strong cash pile, recurring subs, no debt. It would take a lot to set this thing below $20 so thats where I am estimating the floor.
* Ceiling: Mid thirties is totally reasonable on execution, possibly $40+ if CLEAR1 becomes the next Okta-for-humans
* Current PPS: $29
* Target PPS: $34-36
* Expected Upside: Approx 20-25%
* Divvy? Small, but real .6% plus buybacks

The market still sees this as a fancy airport perk company. What I see is optionality and a floor.

**$$$ TL;DR  for my fellow ADHD Portfolio Managers: $$$**

* Real biz, real margins, real upside
* B2C moat + B2B growth = Juicy hybrid
* CLEAR1 is the wildcard that could re-rate the company to the upside
* Floor's solid, ceiling's open. Short interest adds some spice
* If they execute, $YOU could quietly double in 2-3 years. If not? Still not trash

Summary Stats:

* Target: $34-36
* Current: $29
* Upside: 20-24%
* Grade: Pearl-ish if they dont fumble the bag
I'm curious to know how good Clear's cyber security is: them protecting users data. 

The identifying deepfake play, identity stealing detection is very intriguing. 

I'm wondering if this will dwindle fast with AI automation and not even needing to hire real people. This ChatGPT garbage is a waste of everyone's time.

If you're going to write a stock analysis, write it yourself. I stopped reading when it became clear your post is AI slop. While they have a B2B expansion plan they’re still too focused on the US market and on traditional KYC. I am of the opinion that traditional KYC is almost certainly dying with the ease of spinning up convincing deep fakes with AI, and companies like this are going to either need to create a better mousetrap, or die due to irrelevance. double click on that for a moment. I'd love to hear the expanded version of that YOU leadership and talent is the key to your take on expanding their moat and adopting in novel ways. Or maybe some acquisitions or research ties.

I hadn't thought about block chain in this scenario but I have a couple of plays on it. Just pure speculation. 

As far as next gen id, I don't know. I had Clear years ago when I traveled all the time. I'd need to refresh on what they do now.  Normally identity is based on something you have, you are, or you know. So I would need to research and have that concept in mind.

What I don't understand about the deep fakes is how they impersonate someone in the US and not get caught with SSN from the IRS. Even those people who are job stacking. Maybe that will be even easier with the government seemingly being slashed. 

I'd be more worried about bad actors being able to steal slowly from a company who legitimately work for a company. I can think of a lot more scenarios for fraud that I've personally witness in my career that is harder to detect. And all the ethics training you get isn't making those people have ethics. 

Thanks for sharing, I was looking for a research topic for my investing and trading. This seems to be a good one on multiple levels. Slightly different concerns here. Research has shown that Google trends are still strong, I think this is twofold:
1. Consumer behavior,
2. Conventional search still has utility

This isn’t to say consumer behavior won’t change over time or that conventional search declines in utility either though. The fundamental issue with YOU is that their core business model is unlikely to be sustainable unless they find a better way to address fraud in the B2B space today. They may still have a strong moat in airports, but from a B2B standpoint there are multiple players (not yet public) who are better positioned.

That said, YOU could leverage themselves up with some debt and just buy a competitor in this space to help advance their roadmap. It’s what I’d do if I were them. Given their current size, Nametag would be the ideal acquisition for them imo. Small company, pretty decent product, minimal money raised, they’re clearly focusing on integrations for the enterprise in particular. Very nice, thanks for the dd. I havent dug into it yet, but just scrolling the nametag homepage it definitely addressing some of those pain points. If YOU had the foresight to get in front of this, you're talking about some real first-mover advantage. Adding this into the notes, thanks! For what it’s worth, Nametag doesn’t have first mover advantage. There are a variety of AI-driven automated solutions and these are companies that have raised hundreds of thousands (Socure, Persona, and a handful of others).",0,0.47,17,0,SniperPearl,stocks,['NVDA'],boarding pass cash stack yous identity play legs whats fellow midcap misfits today bring attention airport fast lane turned public equity clear secure ticker scroll end want adhd portfolio managers cliff notes quietly cashing checks everyones distracted nvda vs arm cage matches im talking real profits governmentgrade access fat pile cash cherry top theyre pivoting another revenue stream b2b saas expansion plan might take tsa side hustle enterprise verification empire anyway clear secure company behind vip skip line biometric lanes airports stadiums big venues tsa precheck tsa actually moved human speed call clear plus already used 30m people theres revenue pivot clear1 b2b identity verification platform think linkedin uber even tmobile using clear tech make sure usersemployees arent bots stolen ids hits youre looking lowkey saas transformation lets talk money fcf margins 40 gaap profitable net income 6x yoy zero debt 13 billie cash math yes thats 910share sitting theyre buying back shares paying dividend like grown isnt cute send thing next flight moon clear1 traction need proof concept inked 20 enterprise deals tmus already live index inclusion analyst upgrades expansion new airportsstadiumsvenues aka sticky skip line subscribers trying cut line dont love guys risk reward right risks include clear1 fizzles ends linkedin footnote leadership shakeup foundercfo stepped recently political grandstanding kills airport access good risk reward profile floor strong cash pile recurring subs debt would take lot set thing 20 thats estimating floor ceiling mid thirties totally reasonable execution possibly 40 clear1 becomes next oktaforhumans current pps 29 target pps 3436 expected upside approx 2025 divvy small real 6 plus buybacks market still sees fancy airport perk company see optionality floor tldr fellow adhd portfolio managers real biz real margins real upside b2c moat b2b growth juicy hybrid clear1 wildcard could rerate company upside floors solid ceilings open short interest adds spice execute could quietly double 23 years still trash summary stats target 3436 current 29 upside 2024 grade pearlish dont fumble bag im curious know good clears cyber security protecting users data identifying deepfake play identity stealing detection intriguing im wondering dwindle fast ai automation even needing hire real people chatgpt garbage waste everyones time youre going write stock analysis write stopped reading became clear post ai slop b2b expansion plan theyre still focused us market traditional kyc opinion traditional kyc almost certainly dying ease spinning convincing deep fakes ai companies like going either need create better mousetrap die due irrelevance double click moment id love hear expanded version leadership talent key take expanding moat adopting novel ways maybe acquisitions research ties hadnt thought block chain scenario couple plays pure speculation far next gen id dont know clear years ago traveled time id need refresh normally identity based something know would need research concept mind dont understand deep fakes impersonate someone us get caught ssn irs even people job stacking maybe even easier government seemingly slashed id worried bad actors able steal slowly company legitimately work company think lot scenarios fraud ive personally witness career harder detect ethics training get isnt making people ethics thanks sharing looking research topic investing trading seems good one multiple levels slightly different concerns research shown google trends still strong think twofold 1 consumer behavior 2 conventional search still utility isnt say consumer behavior wont change time conventional search declines utility either though fundamental issue core business model unlikely sustainable unless find better way address fraud b2b space today may still strong moat airports b2b standpoint multiple players yet public better positioned said could leverage debt buy competitor space help advance roadmap id given current size nametag would ideal acquisition imo small company pretty decent product minimal money raised theyre clearly focusing integrations enterprise particular nice thanks dd havent dug yet scrolling nametag homepage definitely addressing pain points foresight get front youre talking real firstmover advantage adding notes thanks worth nametag doesnt first mover advantage variety aidriven automated solutions companies raised hundreds thousands socure persona handful others
1lyyevw,2025-07-13,"AMD stock: Q1 recap and growth catalysts
AMD started FY 2025 on a strong foot, and I expect strong double-digit growth for the full fiscal year. In the Data Center segment, the company reported 57% year-over-year growth in the first quarter. The growth was mostly fueled by the expanding EPYC CPU deployments. I am optimistic that such growth momentum can be sustained thanks to its partnerships with hyperscalers and enterprise customers. In addition, with the new platforms and ROCm software advances reported in the ER, I see AMD’s position in the AI infrastructure space further reinforced.

In other segments, I see encouraging developments too, in particular in terms of AI-related offerings. For instance, the Client segment reported a 68% YOY revenue increase in Q1. The key drivers include strong desktop and notebook demand, higher ASPs, and growing traction in commercial PCs with Ryzen AI chips. In the Embedded system, I see demand gradually improving and believe the new edge AI offerings (such as the EPYC Embedded 9005 and Versal AI Edge) as key drivers.
Q1 numbers were seriously strong. 57% YoY in Data Center and 68% in Client is no joke. Ryzen AI seems to be gaining real traction, especially in commercial.

If they keep this pace going and MI300X + ROCm continue to improve, there’s still a lot of upside. Feels like the market isn’t fully pricing that in yet.

Also think people are sleeping on Embedded and AI Edge. Quiet but promising. Will grow massively. Reckon 200$ 2026 Won’t be surprised if we hit that by EOY Did they publish Q1 results? AMD, on the verge of booking lots of profit any day now for 20 years and counting.  Midcap profits with a large cap valuation, is there a better combination?  If they can maintain their recent growth rate then in 2 years they might match their annual profits from 4 years ago and have an ultra low PE of just 60. Not seen anything on the supply chain about AMD increasing orders for TSMC packaging or HBM chips.  

Good luck OP. The problem remains that it just doesn't make a lot of money compared to its valuation.  This recent growth is required and needs to be sustained to even grow into its *current* valuation which is down 35% from all time high.  Reddit has always loved AMD's story regardless of its financial performance and I don't get why. Really? Could do. The demand is there.

1lyqeup,2025-07-13,"Powell's ouster 'one of the biggest underestimated event risks in the coming months
U.S. President Donald Trump's potential removal of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell could lead to a ‘meltdown’ in currency and bond markets and a spike in inflation expectations, Deutsche Bank said on Friday.

Earlier this week, Russell Vought, director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, accused Powell of ‘gross’ mismanagement of the Fed and said renovations to the Fed's headquarters were ‘way over budget’ and that the cost of the project had ballooned to about $2.5 billion.

The allegation could open the door for Trump to seek Powell's removal. The president has repeatedly criticised the Fed chairman for failing to lower interest rates and has hurled a series of insults at him. He has reportedly considered firing Powell and appointing a successor before the end of his term.

George Salaveros, head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, noted that the market now expects Powell's ouster to be very unlikely. According to forecasting platform Polymarket, the likelihood of Powell stepping down is currently 15 per cent.

But Salaveros offered some thoughts on the possible implications.

He says: ""The empirical and academic evidence on the impact of a loss of central bank independence is fairly clear: in the extreme case, both currency and bond markets could collapse as inflation expectations rise, real yields fall, and broader risk premiums rise due to institutional erosion. Interestingly, the implications for equities are even more ambivalent given that they are ultimately a claim on real assets.""

It is difficult to quantify the impact on FX and interest rates, but in the first 24 hours after Powell's announcement of his departure, we expect the trade-weighted dollar to fall by at least 3-4 per cent, while US fixed income will suffer a 30-40 basis point sell-off, led by the back end,’ Salaveros said.

According to the analyst, the market's reaction to the initial news will depend on whether the remaining Fed policymakers ‘agree’ around the central bank's independence, the choice of Powell's successor, and the broader macroeconomic context.

He added: ‘All in all, we see Chairman Powell's departure as one of the biggest underestimated event risks in the coming months.’

This week, trade dynamics have been at the centre of Wall Street's attention, overshadowing monetary policy and the Federal Reserve. Here are some of the exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking the benchmark S&P 500 Index ( SP500 ): ( NYSEARCA: SPY ), ( NYSEARCA: VOO ), ( NYSEARCA: IVV ), ( NYSEARCA: RSP ), ( NYSEARCA: SSO ), ( NYSEARCA: UPRO ), ( NYSEARCA: SH ), ( NYSEARCA: SDS ) and ( NYSEARCA: SPXU ).

To track currencies, here's the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) and some related ETFs: ( NYSEARCA: UUP ), ( NYSEARCA: USDU ) and ( NYSEARCA: UDN ).

Here are some fixed income linked funds: ( NASDAQ: TLT ), ( NYSEARCA: TLH ), ( NASDAQ: IEF ), ( NASDAQ: IEI ), ( NASDAQ: SHY ), ( NYSEARCA: SGOV ), ( NYSEARCA: SCHO ), ( NYSEARCA: BIL ), ( NYSEARCA: AGG ), ( NASDAQ: BND ), ( NASDAQ: VCIT ), ( NYSEARCA: MUB ), ( NASDAQ: MBB ), ( NYSEARCA: JNK ), ( NYSEARCA: LQD ), ( NYSEARCA: HYG ) and ( NYSEARCA: TIP ).
Hold the line powell. He is a popular meme here, but he did a pretty decent job (as always there will be detractors) in steering the economy through the first Trump administration, then COVID, and now he is doing the best that he can during the second (even more chaotic) Trump term. If Powell somehow (highly unlikely) gets removed then in my opinion all hell will break loose, and not just because he will be gone, but rather because of who will take over. At this point, Powell looks like the only sane man in the US. 

If he ran for prez, I wouldn't be surprised if people actually voted for him Decent? I think Powell did an insane job. The promised soft landing was basically there in terms of data until recently and the economy genuinely seemed to be recovering, at least from what i heard. The point of accusing Powell of gross mismanagement is for them to say they are removing him for cause. The rates are being held high because of the complete idiot in the Whitehouse and his idiotic, inflation inducing policies. you'd be dead wrong. the WWF-ication of politics started in 2016.  Powell doesn't have enogh charimsa to be the next president. [deleted] [deleted] You wear Velcro shoes, huh? Who appointed Powell? Are you actually drooling right now?

1lydvqt,2025-07-12,"Google to Pay $2.4 Billion in Deal to License Tech of Coding Startup, Hire CEO
From the WSJ:

>Google has agreed to pay about $2.4 billion in a deal to license the technology of AI coding startup Windsurf and hire its CEO and some of its employees, according to people familiar with the matter.

>The deal comes after talks for OpenAI to acquire Windsurf stalled, the people said.

>The Alphabet GOOGL unit is hiring a small number of Windsurf employees to focus on agentic coding within its DeepMind division, and the tech giant will also acquire a nonexclusive license to some of Windsurf’s technology.

>Google isn’t taking a stake in Windsurf. Most of Windsurf’s existing employees will remain at the company.

>OpenAI first struck an agreement to buy the startup for $3 billion a few months ago in an effort to boost the growth of its AI coding products. But the deal hit a roadblock after Microsoft, OpenAI’s largest investor, objected to some of the terms, The Wall Street Journal reported.

>OpenAI didn’t want to give Microsoft access to Windsurf’s technology. Under their current contract, the tech giant is entitled to all of the startup’s intellectual property.

>The failed talks are a setback for OpenAI, which is racing against other tech companies to build AI coding assistants, one of the largest new markets enabled by generative AI, and shows how tensions with its largest partner are hampering major business efforts. It is also another example of the pitched battle going on between Silicon Valley giants to hire and retain the most talented AI scientists and engineers.

>Tech giants have pursued similar “acquihire” deals as a way to attract top startup talent while avoiding the scrutiny of antitrust regulators. Google last year paid $2.7 billion to hire its former researcher, Noam Shazeer, and license technology from the startup he started, Character.AI. Microsoft and Amazon have also struck similar deals with startups.

>Google negotiated its deal with Windsurf after the exclusivity window for talks between OpenAI and Microsoft fell through. Tech news site The Verge earlier reported on some aspects of Google’s deal.

This is a huge slap in the face to OpenAI (who was originally trying to acquire Windsurf, but the deal fell through). Google swoops in and grabs it at the very first chance. GOOGL calls it is For good reason. Do you want to do business with google or the unproven private company. How did you get the text to look like that > Is google really the company you want to be acquired by?

Yes The person wrote too much markdowns. There's something weird going on behind the scenes though. Deal with Google is to license their tech (not an acquisition). So, this is like Google themselves being a client of Windsurf and on the balance sheet, it translates to increased revenue for Windsurf. It's unclear how much they've committed to

Here's the catch - Google hired Windsurf CEO and a select few Engineers. Once they move out, Windsurf will now be owned by remaining employees and VC but their valuation will likely drop to zero pretty soon

Google was never interested in their tech, they already have AI studio and the new CEO will likely lead AI studio division

All of this tells me this whole valuation game has smoke and mirror situation going on. Why would Windsurf CEO essentially sell himself to Google if he actually believed Windsurf has superior tech? My guess is at some level he knew company wouldn't scale beyond a limit and did it for money. So do we have startups being created solely with purpose of getting acquired? One other name I can think of is perplexity which has lot of fandom for a somewhat mediocre product.

We may see a ton of M&A/consolidation amongst big AI startups. OpenAI was buying most of the company 

Google gets licensing and some key researchers. Not the whole application IP. If you are an AI researcher than the answer is definitely yes.

Nobody has better infrastructure to work with.  Nobody has more data or better data.

Then the big one.  Google lets them publish.

Plus we should all want them to go to Google.

Google is who makes the huge AI innovations.  Patents it.  Then shares in a paper.  Then the crazy thing.

Google then lets everyone use for completely free.

Nobody else rolls in the same manner as Google. I feel like not too long ago low code automation stocks were the hot stocks. Tech is crazy!

1lycblk,2025-07-12,"Allegion : what am I missing ? (ALLE, ASSA-B, DOKA)
Hello,

It seems to me that nobody cares about Allegion. Please tell why you haven't bought it or why you wouldn't. I already made a post elsewhere and nobody answered. In this post I also speak about major competitors Assa Abloy and Dormakaba

# Allegion (ALLE)

Allegion is a lock, (automatic) door and anti-fire window manufacturer. It also made investments in various technology start-ups (Allegion Ventures). It is a spin-off from Ingersoll Rand (the old one) in 2014. It has a high profitability and is a serial acquirer.

**Asset allocation**

It makes a good number of acquisitions, but also some divestments from time to time. If you look at the constant high profitability (10%-17% since 2016), we can say it is selective with its acquisitions. They continue to make a lot of money on their total assets. Notable acquisition : Stanley access technologies in 2022 from Stanley Black & Decker, that is their entry in the automatic door market.

They use a high leverage (equity ratio of about 30%), they distribute about 30% of their earnings and are doing a lot of buyback (37% of earnings for \~1.2% of outstanding shares (net of dillution) in average) at attractive prices (at the moment at least).

In 2025 they bought :

\* Waitwhile (queue managing software)

\* Gatewise (access control software for multi-family buildings)

\* Next door (US glass/metal and metal doors manufacturer for commercial buildings)

**Management & board**

There is a good stability in the management, eventhough CEO John Stone has been hired in 2022.

For example SVP International Timothy Eckersley was managing the american commercial activities of what was to become Allegion in 2007-2013, then the Americas division (this time including residential as well) in 2013-2020 before leading the international business from 2021. SVP Americas David Llardi joined the group in 2008 and was promoted in 2022. ( [https://ibb.co/jvxb5CyT](https://ibb.co/jvxb5CyT) )

It is less the case on the board with some recent departures of long-time members. ( [https://ibb.co/zWHs08L2](https://ibb.co/zWHs08L2) )

**Other**

There is some risks about the tariffs, considering for example that some of the manufacturing for the american market is done in Mexico.

# Assa Abloy

Assa Abloy is a lock, window elements, (automatic) door and gate manufacturer. It is a merger from 1994 between Assa and Abloy. It has an average profitability. It is 3 times bigger than Allegion.

**Asset allocation**

It makes a good number of acquisitions. If you look at the lower profitability (9%-11.5%, except for 2018), we can say it is less selective with its acquisitions than Allegion. Notable acquisitions : HHI (Kwikset, Baldwin & Weiser etc.) for 4.3B$ in 2023, that is most of their North American residential business segment. The group has a bigger diversification in term of businesses (senior care alarms, RFID for uniforms, perimeter security etc).

They use a lower leverage (equity ratio of about 50%), they distribute about 45% of their earnings. They don't really buy back their shares.

# Dormakaba

Dormakaba is a lock, door, movable wall, key machine manufacturer. Dormakaba is the result of the 2015 merger between swiss Kaba and german Dorma. The swiss holding (what you buy on the stock market) owns 52.5% of the german holding (who owns all the businesses). The ex-owners of Dorma kept 47.5% of the german holding and of the merged activities. In addition, the ex-owners of Dorma, together with some ex-owners of Kaba own a total of 28% of the swiss holding. It is the smallest company of the 3.

The company has very low margins (remember to not exclude earnings of the minority interests to calculate profitability as most of them are the 47.5%). It has made some acquisitions, some of them beeing service companies, but it also made a lot of divestments in recent years.

**Evolution of earnings (CHF)**

12.8 (16), 27.7 (17), 29.5 (18), 31.5 (19), 20.3 (20), 24.1 (21), 15.1 (22), 10.9 (23), 10 (24), 16 (rolling 12m)

Dividend went from 12 to 8. The dividends are subject to swiss witholding tax (partly).

# Conclusion

I don't understand why Allegion has a P/E of 20.9 in itself. Assa Abloy, which is not as good, has a P/E of 21.4. Dormakaba, which is the worst, has a P/E of 46.75. Has anybody an idea about what I am missing ?

The ""negative"" elements don't seem to explain why it is cheap. Yes, there is a tariff risk (same as a lot of companies), there is irish witholding tax, I guess it could get out of S&P500 due to its size (#436 a month ago). The company doesn't have some caracteristics that a lot of investor want (it is an industrial company and it is not a dividend aristrocrat YET).

Please note that I own shares in Allegion and that might influence my opinion on the group.

1ly8yxa,2025-07-12,"(Boeing) Engine fuel supply was cut just before Air India jet crash, preliminary report says
>A cut in the fuel supply to the engines caused last month’s Air India crash that killed 260 people, a preliminary report has found.

>The London-bound plane had barely left the runway at Ahmedabad airport when it hurtled back to earth. Everyone on board was killed, except for one passenger.

>According to the report by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, obtained by CNN, the fuel control switches in the cockpit of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner had been flipped, starving the engines of fuel. The report does not say whether the control switches were flipped by a person or in another way.

>Investigators were able to get data out of the plane’s “black box” recorders, including 49 hours of flight data and two hours of cockpit audio, including from the crash.

>The aircraft had reached an airspeed of 180 knots when both engines’ fuel cutoff switches were “transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of 01 sec,” according to the report.

>“In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff. The other pilot responded that he did not do so,” the report reads.

>Shortly after, the switches were reversed back to where they should have been, and the engines were in the process of powering back up when the crash happened.

>On the 787, the fuel cutoff switches are between the two pilots’ seats, immediately behind the plane’s throttle levers. They are protected on the sides by a metal bar and have a locking mechanism designed to prevent accidental cutoff.

>Airport footage shows the Ram Air Turbine, an emergency power source on an aircraft, deployed during the plane’s initial climb after takeoff, the report said. The plane started to lose altitude before crossing the airport perimeter wall.

>“When fuel control switches are moved from CUTOFF to RUN while the aircraft is inflight, each engines full authority dual engine control automatically manages a relight and thrust recovery sequence of ignition and fuel introduction,” the report states.

>Seconds after the engines attempted to relight, one pilot called out, “MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY.” The controller called out for the plane’s callsign, but didn’t get a response and watched the plane crash in the distance.

>The fuel switches were “designed to be intentionally moved,” according to CNN safety analyst David Soucie, who said cases in which all fuel switches were turned off accidentally are “extremely rare.”

>“Throughout the years, those switches have been improved to make sure that they cannot be accidentally moved and that they’re not automatic. They don’t move themselves in any manner,” Soucie said on Friday.

>The captain of the flight was a 56-year-old who had flown more than 15,000 hours in his career. The first officer was a 32-year old man with over 3,400 flying hours.

>Investigators also noted settings on equipment found in the wreckage was normal for takeoff. The plane’s fuel was tested and found to be of satisfactory quality, and no significant bird activity is observed in the vicinity of the flight path, according to the report.

>The takeoff weight for the plane was found to be within allowable limits, and there were no “Dangerous Goods” on the aircraft. Investigators found the flaps on the wings of the plane were set in the 5-degree position, which is correct for takeoff, and the landing gear lever was in the down position.

>The left engine was installed on the plane on March 26 and the right was installed on May 1, the report said.

>One of the relatives of an Air India victim called for the perpetrators to be punished following the release of the preliminary report. Naresh Maheswari, whose son died in the crash urged the investigators to be neutral, telling India’s ANI news agency that “we want no one else to die due to such carelessness.”

>The brother-in-law of another of the victims, Niraj Patel, said: “We want the government to take all kinds of precautions so that people do not lose their family members to such incidents again.”

>The Air India jet took off from Ahmedabad’s Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport in India’s western state of Gujarat on June 12. The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner was headed to London Gatwick and scheduled to land at 6:25 p.m. local time.

>Air India had said 242 passengers and crew members were on board. That included 169 Indian nationals, 53 Britons, seven Portuguese and one Canadian.

>In addition to those on board, a number of people on the ground were killed when the plane crashed into the BJ Medical College and Hospital hostel.

>The crash resulted in 260 fatalities total, according to the report. A number of the dead on the ground resulted from the plane hitting the hostel.

>Air India acknowledged that it received the report and said it will continue cooperating with authorities in the investigation.

>“Air India stands in solidarity with the families and those affected by the AI171 accident,” the airline posted to X on Saturday (local time). “We continue to mourn the loss and are fully committed to providing support during this difficult time.”

My take: Overall seems to be pilot error rather than anything mechanical, we have decently recovered already from the Air India crash so not sure if this will move the needle further.
Pilot says, ""Why did you cut fuel. Copilot says i didn't on the black box. Consensus among pilots at /r/aviation is that this couldn't have happened as a mistake. There is no procedure that could possibly require cutting off fuel to both engines during take-off, and the switches cannot be manipulated through accidental contact. This was almost certainly a deliberate crash, for reasons unknown. >Pilot error

That would be unlikely. You can't toggle those switches by accident. They are at the bottom of the throttle levers and you have to pull them before putting them down to the CUTOFF position. Pilot error or suicide. Then the black box reported the switches were moved from ""cutoff"" to ""run""..




The guy made a huge mistake(or intentional) Maybe his instinct was to deny it.


Pilot
""You fucked up and killed us""   
Co-pilot
""No I didnt""


And if the claims is the switch ""shorted out""


1st
This system is very basic and robust and designed to function in emergency situations.  The left and right switches are separate and redundant so you would need at minimum a simultaneous double failure, but most likely a quadruple, or sextaple failure for both engines to shut down.  Also the airplane would self report malfunctions in the switch including full loss of comunication.


2 separate switches at least double or triple redundant per switch.


2nd
Did the switch malfunction?


go from Run to Cutoff?


Then after the pilot asking why did you cutoff the engines, seconds later go from ""cutoff"" to ""run""  one engine was relighting, but there is not enough time in this part of takeoff.


Seems to be exact timing a mistake, then a correction along with conversation in the flight deck. Pilot unions don't want it A Boeing advisory, issued in 2018 by the FAA, flagged a potential issue with fuel control switches on various Boeing aircraft models, including the 737 and potentially the 787 involved in the recent Air India crash. The advisory noted that some fuel control switches were found to have their locking mechanism disengaged, which could lead to inadvertent movement of the switch. While the FAA considered it an advisory, not a mandatory directive, it recommended inspections to ensure the locking mechanism was engaged. So, why are we still waiting for webcams in the cockpit? Nah the copilot could have just seen the indicator transition from run to CUTOFF hence his question but the pilot answered with yeah nah that wasn't me. And usually these indicators a re independent of the switch and more of an actual state indicator for the engine.

Plane indicators 101, you do not monitor the switches you monitor the component that the switch works on. It’d be understandable if they were in private space but they’re working, and their work pertains to the lives of hundreds of people. It’s common for workplaces to have cameras. Construction sites have cameras. They really don’t have much of an argument against it.",289,0.91,156,0,WinningWatchlist,stocks,['META'],boeing engine fuel supply cut air india jet crash preliminary report says cut fuel supply

1ly6trs,2025-07-12,"ChatGPT hit 100M users ~3 years ago. Google search shows no decline $GOOG
Almost every day I read about how search is dead, but AFAICT the metrics show the complete opposite story - search revenue is in fact growing faster than it was back then.  

Even apples data point was quickly disproven; Apple exec noted *safari* searches dipped; NOT Google queries from iOS devices.  This could be due to safari losing market share to chrome.  Google itself confirmed that iOS google queries are increasing not decreasing. 

If a move were to happen it probably would have happened when ChatGPT had a unique product; but there’s several models which have the same quality (Claude Gemini and even Grok), including embedded into Google search itself

Gemini app (not AI overviews, but actual product) has 400M MAU already 

The narrative seems so disconnected from reality thus I am all in $GOOG

Right now if search revenue was $0, Google’s PE would be less than Microsoft’s. and that’s for a bunch of hyper growth businesses (YouTube Waymo GCP TPU etc)

For those who whole heartedly believe search has died, what metrics are you using?
 

I work for a ecommerce retailer who gets millions of sessions every month.

Our Google Search Console traffic is up YoY by about 20%.

However I think alot of people who use ChatGPT, myself included, do not use it for shopping purposes and more research or, help on how to do something.

Eg how to do a excel formula. I just use gemini... built into my android, why fight my Google tech overlords? They have guided me and taken my data since middle school. All hail goog! A lot of times I’ll Google something that ChatGPT said. Chatgpt won't show me horse porn. But google will. 

Bullish. Alphabet-u-Akhbar Does anyone use the AI mode tab on Google? That replaced almost all of my llm usage because it gives me the answers I need and does a good job of using the Google search data. I'm surprised people don't talk about it at all. Google what ChatGPT said, get a dozen websites written by or copied from LLM output. Either these bots are going to get extremely proficient extremely quickly and absolutely buttufuck the economy or they’ll make the internet entirely unusable. I see them as being two totally different needs. No idea why they’d conflict with each other. There’s a good chance Google wins AI.

1mmuggu,2025-08-10,"NVDA and AMD hit with 15% Tariff on China Revenues
https://www.ft.com/content/cd1a0729-a8ab-41e1-a4d2-8907f4c01cac
Believe it or not, calls definitely calls. the article says this only applies to chips that the companies sell in China. the tariffs will be offset by, you know, actually being able to sell in china now More like China hit with 15% markup on NVDA and AMD chips. How is this not blackmail? Pay 15% or face restrictions. Fuck man this is regarded in sooo many levels Booooombaclaat Welcome to the new US. No different than Putin forcing his oligarchs to pay up. The US has truly become a mob state that believes in isolationism. 

Only so long before investors start to look elsewhere Wait a minute i thought the other countries were gonna pay the tariff not our companies- Agent Orange Yeah OP needs to modify the headline - this isn't a 15% tariff -- it is a 15% charge on revenue against Nvidia/AMD on sales they make to China.  At best its a 'reverse tariff' and is unprecedented.  This is being done to enable the issuance of an export license.

  
Any business in the US that requires an export license may be having a pretty uneasy Sunday night - if they're about to get a shakedown of 15% on revenue in order to continue making sales.

Lost 40% of my entire portfolio after going all in on Figma IPO taking me down to $7.5k. This was after I told myself I would stop trading options and focus more on shares only to YOLO at the very top. After such a loss I felt I had no choice but to move every penny of what I had back into my options account to try and save things and as regarded as that may have been I got very lucky.

On Thursday I bought SPY puts turning 3k into 19k and at close bought calls expiring the next day again timing the top and bottom to make another nice gain. MSTR puts also made me an additional $3.5k

Gonna take out around 20k now and go back to shares, no more IPO's or silly penny stocks. Will continue to gamble the rest in true regard fashion 🫡

I was able to get only 10 at IPO and missed the entire run to $180. But, I moved my other investments and some gains during the start of this week when it dropped. Planning to invest more in $CRWV as I am able to add funding. Earnings will reported on 12th Aug + $NVDA earnings later. 

VAMOOOOOSSS!!!  🚀 🚀 🚀
going back to 200

datacenters and datacenter infrastructure are the best opportunity in the market right  now

only $NVDA can make the chips because $AMD is trash. $CRWV gets first best access to $NVDA chips. $CRWV #1. I like $NBIS more. Higher upside potential imo. Definitely bro! I mean, if you can afford AMD then why not but I'm all in on Nvidia with the remaining portfolio. 

Plan to risk as much as I can afford to lose on options and if there are any gains then they go  back in either NVDA or  CRWV shares. I am on the NBIS train as well after doubling up my initial position in CoreWeave before exiting. Both are solid plays for the near/long term but NBIS is a much cleaner play for the near term as I foresee way more volatility in CoreWeave with the Lock up period coming soon ali g with the crazy amount of debt they have built up.

Part of me wishes I had not gotten out of Corewweave entirely when I did as they ran to $180 but when I saw the recent drop to below the $120 which I exited at it made me feel much better about my initial decision. I can handle volatility but that is another level of swing You gotta remember NBIS can swing like that too. In April it dropped from 50 (my initial entry) to 18, and I panic sold at 25 thinking it was fucked due to the tarrifs, well that was a bad idea and I lost a good bit from it. Lol. I’m too lazy to write up a DD, but here’s their Q2 financial results. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1mk0tup/nebius_rockets_on_q2_beat_revenue_soars_625_ai/

They just destroyed revenues. I would do some decent investigating if I were you. I doubled down after these results. Basically they own 3 companies AVRide, Toloka (Jeff Bezos invested), and their cloud computing (Nebius). They also own 30% of ClickHouse. Investigate each of these companies. I have high conviction Nebius will be a 100B company in 5 years. 

I own 1010 shares at a 55$ avg. I think they will beat expectations. But still have a negative eps. Negative profit is fine for the safe of rapid growth. It will all be about forward guidance, growth numbers, and debt balance . Yeah but the entire stock market was impacted in April with “liberation day” announcement - with 2 earnings report from NBIS since then which have absolutely crushed it with more room to run in the coming quarters I am willing to deal with NBIS volatility over what I have seen from CoreWeave

TLDR: AMD finally caught up to NVDA, the market doesn’t realize, go giga long $AMD. 

Buy $TLT just incase market crashes so you don’t blow your account up in a black swan, or if thesis is wrong. 


Trade Setup:
	•	33% Portfolio: AMD calls 12/17/27, $360 strike (111% out of the money as of today)
	•	66% Portfolio: $TLT shares (U.S. Treasury bonds)

$AMD Thesis In A Nutshell:

$NVDA market cap: $4.4T
$AMD market cap: $270B

The world is in a massive race to get more chips, and NVDA looks on track for a $10T market cap.

For the first time starting this quarter, AMD’s MI355X is on par with NVDA, with cheaper chips. Sam Altman promoted the MI400 and MI450 at an AI event earlier this year. Hyperscaler consensus is that they are testing the MI350 this year to get familiar with integrating AMD into their data centers, so they will be ready to place big orders next year for the rack scale MI400 and MI450. This was noted on the most recent earnings call.

From here on, AMD’s chips will be on par, if not better, than NVDA for inference, which both Jensen Huang and Sam Altman agree will grow 1000x+ from current demand levels. Jensen said this on the GP2 podcast interview.

In 2024, AMD did $12B in data center revenue with inferior chips, while NVDA did $115B. If AMD can do $55B in 2027, which is half of NVDA’s 2024 data center revenue, it is easily a $1T company, or an $800 stock.

Everything suggests AMD will have a competitive product at a competitive price point, with demand setting up to be off the charts in 2026 and 2027, similar to NVDA’s neck breaking 2023 and 2024 growth rates of 100%+.

Second Leg Of Trade:

If there is a recession or a black swan event, the Fed will cut rates and send TLT soaring, making up for a $0 AMD option. This is a simple hedge against a Covid style scenario.

Best Case:
	•	TLT gains 50% to 100% from rate cuts on 66% of my portfolio
	•	AMD 4x in 2.5 years from AI chip demand, with calls returning 20x on 33% of my portfolio

Base Case:
	•	AMD calls go to $0 if NVDA outcompetes AMD like in past AI failures such as MI300
	•	TLT rises as rates come down, which recovers the call premiums and results in break even in about 2.5 years

Worst Case:
	•	AMD calls go to $0
	•	TLT drops because inflation spikes, resulting in a 30% loss there as well. This is unlikely in my opinion but possible.

MI350X and MI355X should already drive healthy growth for AMD. However, MI400 will be the real game changer because of its scalability. AMD already raised the price for MI350, which just went into production, to $25,000 per chip. MI400 will be a true rack scale solution, making it highly competitive for large cluster projects.

https://preview.redd.it/8y0n6qovqvhf1.png?width=1730&format=png&auto=webp&s=0475a38511c6f0ee24f915e8b965a19533a8d9e8

At the bottom are the images with all the companies.

The white cells are the data I entered by hand, not calculated.

""BMO / AMC"": Before Market Open / After Market Close

""CALL / PUT PREVIOUS CLOSE PRICE"": The price of the Call, the Put, and the sum of the two.

The green area is the data after publishing earnings:  
08/04/2025 - BMO -> Prices from 08/04/2025  
08/04/2025 - AMC -> Prices from 08/05/2025

The yellow zone at the end is the high and low prices from the results release to the expiration date.

Points to keep in mind:

1. Data from Google Finance and Yahoo Finance.
2. Some stocks had very little or no options volume.
3. **In the post-earnings option price I am not taking into account the time value.**
4. For the strike I always use the closest to the closing price.

https://preview.redd.it/chlob1ywqvhf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b22eeedaee44db4f79d0cdb93701474ec737eb68

A stock has no options and another did not trade any put on 08/07/2025 with strike 17.5 and I made up the price (the one in red in the last image).

Why do companies that even their CEO doesn't know appear on Earnings Whispers?

# Is there a winning strategy?

When someone posts that they've gone from 100k to 200k with one of these plays I wonder:

Why didn't that person post the 100k YOLO?

Wouldn't that person be willing to publish his losses out of shame if he lost?

There are always people betting on both sides, there are always winners and losers.

What's the point of this then?

I would love to see someone go from 1k or 10k to 1M or more with several winning bets in a row.

1k \* 2\^10 = 1,024,000

10k \* 2\^7 = 1,280,000

Can anyone really get it right 7 times in a row?

With a lot of luck, you can even multiply by more than 2 and need to get it right less often.

I hope you share your opinion. Thanks for reading.

survival bias, the dude who lost 1mil and wants to kill himself anit making a reddit post for karma. run the following:   
all calls/puts/straddles across the board,  cost vs profit for one contract each.   
would be interesting study to run, basically do a weekly diversified yolo where you divide your float across all these companies earnings and buy as much as you can with the reserved amount.   
then you repeat the next week, and so on. Also notice that many of the ""YOLOs"" are not even YOLOs, they are gains, the big move has already happened. but the more you buy, the more you save! What source did you use for historical option prices? The earnings strategy is unsustainable, although I have been trying to perfect it and I win more than I lose the slight gain isn’t worth the days/nights of stress And when do you sell?

Either way, most options lose value, I think you'd end up bankrupt buying them all. Excellent resources It seems like Reddit isn't loading images properly?

1ml3wvg,2025-08-08,"Final NVDA Q2 Earnings Estimates: A New Challenger Appears!
**TL;DR at the bottom--** [**previous DD** ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1m5yp45/muted_results_but_booming_guidance_nvda_q2/)**on Q2 Earnings, my wrist is healing well thank you**  


# Leaning into AI Criticism: 

On every post I make that is longer than 5 complete sentences, someone accuses the post of being written by AI. I only take offense to that notion because my analysis and writing is far more valuable than what any AI could produce. I am putting this to the test by asking the new and exciting GPT5 model for its own estimates which will be included in my comparisons to analysts.  


# Updates to My Estimates:

Overall, there are only minimal changes to the [initial post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1m5yp45/muted_results_but_booming_guidance_nvda_q2/) a few weeks ago. In the interest of Reddit attention spans, I will only highlight the changes and new totals.  
  
**Total Revenue: $46.4B**, Up $0.25 (Gaming Increase)  
**EPS: $1.03**, Up $0.01 (Increased Revenue)  


# A New Challenger in GPT5:

[Headline Estimates from GPT5](https://preview.redd.it/y7h3eiw0cuhf1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9332c28885bdbec364be95f7efe16ecefe3d122)

I fed my previous posts to GPT5 (they're on Reddit anyway) and prompted it to come up with its own estimates. The above image shows the headline projections from GPT and its bullish estimates prompted me to ask for a segment breakdown. 

[Revenue by Segment and EPS](https://preview.redd.it/5ut7zj4ccuhf1.png?width=1562&format=png&auto=webp&s=66f3898cf08e8c71f25064cd9611a61cb05ef3c3)

GPT5 is expecting strong numbers from NVDA's Data Center Segment, while its Gaming and Prof. Visualization estimates are lower than mine. GPT5 is slightly more bullish Robo & Auto than I am.   


# The Estimates Stacked Up:

[GPT5 noted this as a fair way to represent their estimates](https://preview.redd.it/9u6xxt9wcuhf1.png?width=1756&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6270483896b29093ca5d80ac7db2f1f61adb0c3)

This is what the three estimates look like stacked against each other, and it now offers a wide range of perspectives. Analyst consensus is almost always conservative (going on 3 consecutive years of beats), so comparing my detailed analysis to a likely-sandbagged estimate is hardly fair. Since AI is supposed to take my job as an analyst, let's see how the actuals compare.  


# Positions:

Still in my 200 shares and ATM (Bit ITM now) Covered Calls, looking to manage in September or October.   


[$175 Calls at around 0.60 Delta Early August](https://preview.redd.it/4ioivgxjeuhf1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7f834007b66898571302f5691d4b081a1c1ea39d)



# TLDR:

\- My Estimates Increased Slightly to $1.03 EPS on $46.4 Billion in Revenue  
\- Leaning into AI Criticism by Introducing GPT5 as an Analyst to Compare to  
\- Three estimates range in aggressiveness (AI then Me then Analyst Consensus)  
\- Still in 200 shares and short Covered Calls that have \~0.60 Delta Each
I'm not reading all of that. Is it calls or puts? It's always calls im pretty sure Should I ask reddit directly for the play, or should I ask an AI that scrapes reddit? 🤔 https://preview.redd.it/4twhmu72quhf1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4cf12db2e8f82dee2993b115a164678f235a1c13

Positions say down then up That's because it was AI............ 


:p Those calls are itm and if end of august earnings are good you can expect a gap up through your 190 breakeven, while you have to either wait for dec for your calls to be exercised, or buy em back at a massive loss.

If your cool with tying up this much capital for 12 weeks and having to buy back in in the 220's let it ride. Not sure why you chose post earnings dates. They’ll report great numbers but it goes down this time. Why? Just vibes bro I like the way you broke this down into sections, made it very easy to read and understand, thank you! I know....

* Tesla Inc. has secured a Transportation Network Company rideshare license in Texas under the name **Tesla Robotaxi LLC**, joining operators such as Uber and Lyft.
* The license is mandated by a new Texas law, effective September 1, 2025, that brings autonomous-vehicle–based services under the same regulatory framework as traditional human-driven rideshares.
* This permitting follows Tesla’s June launch of an invite-only robotaxi pilot in Austin, where Model Y vehicles running Full Self-Driving software have been operating with remote oversight.
* Notably, the Texas permit’s **“Safety Driver”** field is marked **“No,”** underscoring that Tesla’s Austin robotaxi service is running **fully driverless**.
* In response, shares of Uber and Lyft dipped on the heightened competition, while Tesla’s stock rose on the prospect of a fully autonomous rideshare network.

Yesterday it pumped on no news. Now it is pumping cause it got a permit. 

It also pumps when sales in UK and Germany drop by 55%. 

It’s almost as if the stock is manipulated and propped up 🧐 I thought it was a matter of public record that his FSD doesn't work ?

Edit: Interesting, I didn't realize there were some people who still haven't figured out Musk is full of shit. Oh now the random pump makes sense at least vibe-wise. Not really buying the valuation… Stay out of Texas - got it I'll always support any plan to kill texans Except they can’t, and there’s multiple videos showing they can’t. Are there poly market odds to bet on the timeframe for the first death? Tesla has driven like no miles with robotaxi is Austin, it’s kind of pathetic. All of the miles driven the 7 weeks of robotaxi, Waymo drives that number in less than an hour - every single day. Ah don‘t think manipulation is the right word. It’s a wide range of speculators and momentum algos that lead to this random behavior. Long term it will find it‘s valuation according to its fundamentals but will take a while.

After a long while, doing options here and there. Betting on earnings and or random meme stocks from you regards, i settled on a consistent strategy to make money with options in the form of mitigating losses with 0Dte puts on spy.

I only trade between 9:30 to 11:30am maybe 1pm, and look at the magnificant 7 as indicators for where the market may head in the short term. Using puts as loss mitigation. 

Maybe I'll get hosed eventually, but I finally feel confident in the strategy. Good luck out there.

1mk0tup,2025-08-07,"Nebius Rockets on Q2 Beat: Revenue Soars 625 %, AI Cloud Turns Profitable, Outlook Hiked to $1 B - Is This the Next Palantir?
**Nebius Group N.V. (NASDAQ: NBIS) — Q2 FY 2025 Snapshot**

* **Explosive top-line growth**[**.**](https://imgur.com/a/Pzs2XqZ) Revenue jumped to **$105.1 million**, up **+625 % YoY** and **+106 % QoQ**, as demand for the company’s AI-focused cloud infrastructure surged.
* **Positive inflection in core operations.** The Nebius AI Cloud segment moved into **positive adjusted EBITDA**, narrowing the overall adjusted EBITDA loss to **-$21.0 million** versus -$58.1 million a year ago.
* **Headline GAAP profit driven by one-time gain.** A **$597 million mark-to-market gain** on equity holdings swung GAAP net income to **$502.5 million**; excluding special items, **adjusted net loss was –$91.5 million**.
* **Raised outlook.** Management lifted 2025 year-end **ARR guidance to $900 million–$1.1 billion** (previously $600 million–$800 million).
* **Scaling for AI demand.** Cap-ex more than tripled YoY to **$510.6 million** as Nebius accelerates data-center build-outs and works to secure **>1 GW of power capacity by 2026**.
* **Balance-sheet & share data.** Cash fell to **$1.68 billion** after heavy investment; 238.7 million shares outstanding (Class A + B) plus options/RSUs.
* **Street reaction.** Shares rose **≈16 % pre-market to \~$64** following the release.
* **Next events.** Earnings webcast today at **8 a.m. ET**; next scheduled report: Q3 results in late October.

**Takeaway:** Nebius is rapidly converting surging AI-infrastructure demand into triple-digit revenue growth and edging toward operating profitability.

1mjk4xm,2025-08-06,"SRPT Stock - The Meta of 2025 🚀🚀
Ladies and Gentlemen, we all know about the rise Meta stock had since 2022 when it was trading at a PE of 9. I bring you the META of 2025, Sarepta Pharmaceuticals $SRPT which is currently trading at a PE of 2. The stock was trading at $150 last year and is currently trading at at $17.3. The reason two patient deaths in non- ambulatory patients earlier this year. The company has since stopped shipping shipments for non-ambulatory patients.

Revenue Breakdown: The company had $2.2 billion in revenue last year based on 4 approved drugs on the market. 1 billion came from 3 drugs combined. Another billion came from the 4th drug named Elevidys. From the $1.2 billion share, 80% revenue comes from ambulatory patients. Hence, even if the shipments to non-ambulatory population is halted, the company can still make around 1 billion revenue from the ambulatory population. More than 800 ambulatory patients have been dosed in past 2 years and there have been 0 deaths. The targeted patient population are young guys who have rare disease named DMD which causes patients to lose the ability to walk at 12 and confirmed death in their 20's.

Earnings on 8/6: The company announced earnings today. The free cash flow was 200 million. At this run rate, the company is trading at a Price to Earnings of 2 and Price to Sales of 0.8. Normally biotech companies have a Price to Sales of 3-4 making this stock very undervalued. Stock is up 8% 🚀after Earnings today 

FDA Drama: There was a recent death of non-ambulatory patient undergoing a Phase 1 trial (different drug than Elevidys) and the FDA commissioner Vinay Prasad asked the company to pause shipments for both ambulatory and non-ambulatory patients. The decision was reversed in 3 days and the company was allowed to continue shipping the product for ambulatory patients. This controversy got the FDA commissioner Vinay to get fired on the same day. This tells u how strong the company's lobbying and patient advocacy groups are

Position: 220k worth of share at average 16.50.

Target Price: $50+ by end of 2025

Additionally, Popular Hedge Fund De Shaw recently bought 5 million shares on 7/18 at average of $14.5. SI currently is 16.5%
""The stock was trading at $150 last year and is currently trading at at $17.3. The reason two patient deaths in non- ambulatory patients earlier this year."" I'm sold, just took out a second mortgage. Their drug doesn’t work. I’m in biotech and have a PhD in molecular biology. They skipped some of the tests needed to validate their approach. AAV for cellular therapy is risky and permanent. If they discover something better but you’ve already used AAV on a patient, you can’t go back and re-try. Generally I think it’s a garbage company with garbage technology.

So, calls I guess. God I love this sub I bought 250 shares like a month ago. Then I bought 250 more. Then I kept buying and buying, and now I’m up to 6500 shares. Way bigger position than I ever thought I’d be getting into but the opportunity just kept looking better and better. 

If I get burned I’m done with bios forever - again. I got calls expiring Friday I can't wait until end of 2025 lol What's IV?

1mjk4ot,2025-08-06,"RDDT holders - help me understand how RDDT Answers affects your investment thesis
I own 510 shares as a longterm shareholder. I am bullish on ads, and leveraging AI data, and acting as the last bastion of human generated content.... but the answers function isn't clicking for me. I used it a few times and it seems like a shoddy combination of google search (brings up reddit threads) and LLM (where an AI summarizes them poorly).

People have google and ChatGPT as the dominate incumbents for search. You go on any of those platforms and ask a question and its likely reddit threads will popup, along with other sources, giving a user a wide range of sources. And how can Reddit compete with the behemoths of Google search and LLM of ChatGPT/Gemini? If Reddit answers becomes a thing, could google/chatgpt work to reduce showing reddit results and thus lower DAU?

I also feel like users have already switched between google and chatGPT recently, and are not interested to try out a new platform of reddit search, and already get reddit results from using those two platforms.

Also, if I want to search something on reddit, I can just use the search function and look up threads myself or append reddit to my google/chatGPT searches? I feel RDDT works best as the next generation forum technology that removes the need for any forum websites ever, and their data as AI training, and where humanity will rely on as the last bastion of human generated content. Reddit Answers seems like a distraction IMHO. Leave the LLM development and searching algos to OpenAI/Google IMO?
Nobody tell him.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.* Reddit is morphing from an under-monetised forum site into a dual-engine, high-margin data & ad platform whose content is table-stakes for generative-AI—and the market still prices it like a niche social app rather than the infrastructure layer it’s becoming.

That combination of structural ad upside, royalty-like AI licensing, and a credible path to index inclusion underpins the long-term bull case.

Plus have you seen their balance sheet? It is cleaner than clean: enough money to pay all the debts in one shot and walk away, any day. My only concern with RDDT is people increasingly staying in the chatgpt area rather coming to the reddit. 


That is the bearish case though.  It doesn’t affect my thesis at all. 

Reddit is a top 10 most visited website. Top 10! That means a lot of ad revenue. It’s involved with AI. They have zero debt. They are profitable with continually improving profits. They have a passionate user base. People not investing in Reddit will unfortunately miss out on massive gains over the next several years. That’s where the Reddit magic comes in. Reddit has real words by real people posted. Chat gpt often cites Reddit and quotes threads and comments on Reddit. Imo the largest bull case is Reddit being the most trust website in the internet for non AI or non sponsored input. Until it stops being one since AI has gotten all the data it needed 


Then it doesn't need to cite reddit etc. when that happens is another thing though  dunno but someone told me the traffic stats on their subreddit was down 20% so far in Aug month over month which sub? Here’s the thing there’s never a point where they’ll have ALL the data it needs. Data is updating every second, every day. Reddit has that information constantly refreshing. Reddit has been growing a lot these past few years and that’s with AI in the mix.

1mjhm1f,2025-08-06,"Made back all my yearly losses in 3 days
Started trading stocks in the middle of January, after trying forex for years. Slow losses over and over.  Found spy options.  First day trading them, I went from around $11000 to over $40000, then closed position at around $7500.  The next day I tried again, took my $7500 to over $11000, then wound up closing position with around $4000 in account.  I really had no idea what I was doing or how the contracts would diminish in value as the day went on.
The last few weeks have been a cycle of a few good days, then blow account on a bad trade by not getting out when it went against me.  Deposit more money, rinse and repeat.
Last Friday I was down to about $700 in my account, threw another $1000 on top of it, and was able to turn that into $4600 on spy, which is where I started on Monday. 
This week I still did a few spy trades, but switched primarily to spx.  And these last 3 days have been incredible.  My account has gone from $4600>$9600>$30000>$93000 today.  
I’m sure I’ll get the usual comments about working at Wendy’s, put it on roulette, luck in a bull market, etc….and that’s cool.

No tl;dr

Just gains 

94% of Roth (will be 100% after the baba calls either expire worthless or profit and I use them to buy more shares)

Then like 100% of my Robinhood,

And like most of my individual since the 3 puts I sold are like “obligations to buy” 300 more shares 


If you are a UNH employee and your life is in danger, please call yo broker and buy more shares Healthcare spending is guaranteed to continue to rise as our older population grows.

Whether it comes from Medicaid or not, someone will be there to manage it, and UNH is in a perfect position to capitalize on it. Your risk is capped by the price you pid for the stock. if the stock goes down to $20 like Intel, you will get your 10-20-30% (capped) premium, but can also go 90% down due to the stock value. And that is a non 0% chance scenario.

[**Join WSB Discord**](https://discord.gg/wsbverse) | [**WSB.gold**](https://wsb.gold) This post is bullish for Webull most of the big beautiful bill medicaid cuts will hit right after the midterm elections in 2026. It will be interesting to see what happens to UNH then So how much do you expect to make off this? You don’t think there is any other stock in the world you could have invested this same amount of money into to maximize gains? Fr fr

The only part im torn on with UNH, is this is a longer term play, I don’t expect a quick recover

and because of that- the 1 year out calls, I’m very tempted to sell, $2000 in premium on the $300 calls, either free $2000 or 30% profit

But since I expect this to be a much better then a 30% gain trade. Only shares and no covered calls, would be too sad if this does much better then 30% in a year

But it’s definitely where I’m getting torn. Would be $6000 free by selling them, and a max of 30% profit isn’t like that’s a small amount in a year…. Got a whole $800 of bull

(Not a guaranteed win imo but it’s a potential 0-100 kind of stock)

In all my years of investing the one thing I’ve never understood is if analysts come up with estimates and a company beats them but doesn’t meet the “expected” number who creates the expected number. I mean if you’re an analyst and you project .40 per share and the company beats that by 20% and the stock drops because it didn’t meet expectations whose expectations aren’t being met?  If it’s the analysts’ then why didn’t they just raise their estimates?

It’s like that old sprint commercial stickin it to the man - but you are the man. So you’re sticking it to yourself. Look back at the three month period from a stocks last earnings report. AMD went up by almost 70%, so the earnings growth has to justify the growth in share price. If amd had gone down 10% in that same time you would see a different reaction to this report. Seemingly a great report and down she goes. $25k here lol Meanwhile tsla shits out a shit earnings of shity shit and it holds/goes up.

Dang, I googled and it's real. And it's in response to Russia and China signing a deal to do the same thing. Crazy.

Sold 80 contracts, Strike $180, dte 12/17/2027 .... If UNH price is above $180, I'll be happy to make $160,000

For this trade, it takes up $331,000 Option Buying power. I have Charles Schwab (margin level-4), I do not pay interest on Margin on Sell Naked Put.

In 2027, if UNH is under $180.... I will sell my other long-term positions and buy UNH.

Short-Term, if UNH is back above $280 or $300, I will sell Naked Call to generate weekly CASH
I have no idea what you just said I'm happy for you though or sorry that happened i will personally drop the stock to $179 tomorrow and early exercise  🤣🤣🤣 basically, I'm betting big 🎰🎲 and will make [ $160,000 💵💰 ] if UNH stock price is ABOVE $180 end of 2027 📆⏳️ Pay attention regards, this is how you get margin called Oh well if it's on margin this is completely fine.

Man, we're so completely fucked. You are representative of the kind of absolute horseshit people are doing to get us over the $1,000,000,000,000 total margin mark.

All this shit is working and one day it's not going to work anymore and you'll keep doubling down thinking it's temporary but it isn't and then it's thirty third floor window service for you.

Ridiculous. I don't have CASH right now to buy 8000 share of UNH. This entire trade is on margin. 

Good thing with my brokerage is that I dont have to pay interest on this margin trade... until I get assigned and buy... but if get assigned, I will sell other long-term positions to buy UNH Personally I think this is a good move, maybe not for WSB since in their mind a 50% return over 2 years is boring, but a good move regardless. I’m DCAing in UNH because they print cash but seeing all of the doom and gloom on here about the company is making me even more optimistic.

1mho65p,2025-08-04,"RDDT YOLO
What is more regarded than yoloing on RDDT? Well, of course yoloing on 2xRDDT == RDTL. Threw $15k into RDTL right before earnings last week and added another $20k today when uptrend was confirmed.

My price target for RDDT is around 500-1000 which brings RTDL to I don't know what.

Next catalysts I'm waiting for are a test of ATH which is 230 and SP500 inclusion.

And yes, I did buy the top on AMZN, that's why it's down!
So Reddit's time spent on website is around 20 mins compared to Meta's 40 minutes (includes family of apps so including undermonetised threads/whatsapp), Reddit generates around $7ish per US user compared to Meta which is like $80?

If Reddit gets a bigger liquidity pool of advertisements, their algorithm works better for targeting and it will improve the performance for the advertisers like how it worked for Meta, Reddit is still in the very early stages of properly monetising

Can someone poke holes in my retarded DD? I started doing some DD on RDDT today and figured I'd highlight some pieces of information I found interesting. I've been a huge fan and user of the platform for years and have nibbled here and there on the stock. I plan on putting $100k on it this week. 



Long term, I don't see how Reddit doesn't 3-10x. Short term, strap in for some volatility. 



I believe this stock gets overlooked on the AI play and among so many other metrics. I tried looking at it as a pure social media play, and and AI play. 



Looking at some basic financials I compared RDDT to some of its social media peers. It actually lags in most financial metrics, but their user base is much larger, and has clearly not been fully monetized. I believe RDDT is just starting to make monetization a priority and I think we'll see huge strides over the next few years.

  
**RDDT (Current)**

Market Cap: $37 Billion

Monthly Users 1.2 Billion

Revenue: $1.3 Billion (FY 2024)

  
**META (Facebook IPO Numbers)**

Market Cap: $104 Billion

Monthly Users: 845 Million

Revenue: $5.08 Billion (FY 2012)

  
**TWTR (Peak)**

Market Cap: $44 Billion (Peak)

Monthly Users: 336 Million (Peak)

Revenue: $5.1 Billion (Peak)

  
As for the AI trade, currently this is actually a small portion of revenue for them. 

""As per [Adweek](https://www.adweek.com/social-marketing/ai-licensing-deals-with-google-and-openai-make-up-10-of-reddits-revenue/), between Google and OpenAI, its AI licensing deal brings in about 10% of its revenue. We know [Google paid about $60 million to Reddit](https://searchengineland.com/reddit-google-ai-content-licensing-deal-437782) for its content deal, and the only other known company to have a deal with Reddit for its content is OpenAI. That leaves OpenAI paying $70 million to Reddit for its licensing deal.""

I fully expect this to grow and the number of deals to increase in the coming months/years. While a lot of AI investment is currently being done on the hardware side, the breadth and amount of data Reddit controls is unimaginable in scale. If you need some data for your AI to consume, Reddit is a great place to start.

Reddit is currently the 6th most visited site in the world. It just overtook Wikipedia in May. The only sites above it are Google, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and ChatGPT. Good DD. Adding to this they also recently added Reddit Answers so that it functions like a search engine as well so you might as add that to the valuation. I bought some Reddit shares on Friday . I figured I would at least throw a little money to the app we all love.. lol Same here. Been a redditor for over 10 years. Before they went public, they sent +10year users a PM with a chance to buy shares early. I followed the steps but then apparentley it was for US citizens only, which I am not. So I missed out. But finally bought a tiny bit last week too Back in February earnings were just as good and it dropped 50% in a month I feel sentiment is different this time. CEO talking about the Google algorithm change tanked the stock. This earnings showed that it was a big nothing burger and they’re growing crazy still. You're not a moron! There is no decay if RDDT just keeps going up. It's only 35B market cap so it's an easy 3-10x from here. >The idea that more ads can make advertising better was a ""contrarian view"" held by Andrew Bosworth (BOS), Meta's CTO and head of Reality Labs, during a critical period in Facebook's history, particularly as the company was shifting its focus to mobile monetization.
His reasoning, challenged initially by Mark Zuckerberg who wanted to show fewer ads due to concerns about user experience, centered on several key points:

>• Ads as Content: Bosworth argued that a great ad could be ""on par with content"" in a user's feed. This suggests that highly relevant and well-targeted ads could be as engaging and valuable to users as organic posts.

>• Liquid Marketplace for Targeting: Showing ""huge amounts more ads"" creates a ""beautiful liquid Marketplace"" with ""hundreds of thousands of advertisers"" and ""billions of users"". This vast scale means there's a greater pool of ads to choose from and a larger user base to target.

>• Data for Algorithms: To achieve ""way better targeting"" and deliver optimal ads, ""fantastic algorithms"" are needed. These algorithms can only be developed and trained effectively with ""tons and tons of data"". More ads mean more interactions and data points, which in turn feed and improve the targeting algorithms.

>• Relevance Problem: Bosworth reframed the issue of ""crappy ads"" not as an ad quantity problem, but as a ""relevance problem."" By increasing the volume of ads, the system gains more opportunities to learn and refine what is most interesting to each user, enabling the display of the ""optimal ad"" for them at any given moment.

>• Increased Engagement: The effectiveness of this approach was later demonstrated when, in some markets, turning off ads in Meta's apps surprisingly led to a decrease in user engagement, further supporting the idea that relevant ads can function as a form of engaging content.
This strategic shift, driven by Bosworth's insights, was crucial for Facebook's mobile monetization, especially given that its S1 filing for IPO explicitly stated that it did ""not currently directly generate any meaningful revenue from the use of Facebook mobile products"". By the fourth quarter of 2013, mobile advertising became the majority (53%) of Facebook's revenue, showcasing the success of this strategy.

1mha61j,2025-08-04,"$PTLO come for the earnings, stay for the value
**TLDR: $PTLO earnings Tuesday Aug 5th AM. $PTLO go up. Buy, make money.**

**My positions:**

***Shares a lot***

***options a little: Jan 2026 $15, Jan 2027 $12, August 15th $10s. Also sold some $10 CSPs in August, but that's probably a little advanced for this class***

$PTLO earnings releases on Tuesday, and I think it is set up to take off.  Ever been like *""Damn if only I bought $wing, $cava, $cmg early"".* Well guess what, HERE YOU GO.

What is Portillos? Chicagoland fast casual that serves, burgers, Chicago style hot dogs, polish sausage, italian beefs, chocolate cake shake, etc. IPO'd late 2021 and bagged a bunch of people (like literally every IPO of the time). Since IPO has been focusing on expansion outside of Chicagoland

# Bull Notes (in no particular order)

* Activist investor group Engaged Capital took \~10% position late last year and been working with $PTLO to quality candidates to the board and optimize expansion and restaurants. There most relevant and impressive work is with Shake Shack

https://preview.redd.it/835ezbs5hzgf1.png?width=1439&format=png&auto=webp&s=41af3ea19c6cf6149e7879581a480b93974f31cd

* Jack Hartung was added to the board this year. He was CFO of Chipotle for 22 years and is current president. Has Chipotle fallen off in recent years, yes. But what we care about is he was apart of the EXPLOSIVE GROWTH of Chipotle since pre 2006 IPO. He is also on the board of $TSLA, which is cool, i guess (Portillo's Tesla diner anyone?) Pre chipotle he did 18 years for Mcdonalds Corp. Guy is solid
* Most recently, Eugene Lee was added to the board in June. CEO of Darden Restaurants from 2015-2022. Darden has some big name restaurants in their portfolio, so another star player to the leadership team that can guide Portillo's along the growth journey

https://preview.redd.it/yblypmfchzgf1.png?width=1240&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd5f4aece1ba9ec6ffcbfbaddc5f9ecb4e4eedaf

* AUV (monies per restaurant) for Portillo's is crazy high $8.7 million per restaurant in 2025 (dragged down a bit by newer operations that aren't up to snuff yet). A chipotle does like 3 million, a texas road house does like 7 million. The only comparable I can find is Chik-fil-le which restaurants can do over $9 million. You should go buy there stock, o wait you cant.
* Total restaurants 94 at end off Q1. Restaurants were going loaded on the back half of the year. 1 Q2, 5-6 Q3, and 5-6 Q4. It'll be good to hear how that's progressing. My guess would be like 3-4ish by the time of the call. There goal is to get scale up to 12-15% per year and almost 10x restaurants to over 900 locations
* Breakfast. Experimenting with it, Already expanded locations from the initial 5 so thats promising. I've tried it, its delicious. Hope to hear some numbers. Mega bull example is McDonald's whose revenue from breakfast is like 25%. Maybe we could hope for a +10% revenue to start at full roll out (if its determined to make permanent and would likely only be chicagoland to start).  Would like to hear some numbers on the call
* PE current low 20s trading like its not a growth stock.

# Bear Notes

* Big sell off -10%  day, recently. Chipotle earnings caused a massive selloff in all restaurant stocks due to bad same store sales. I think its bullshit. Proof go look at $cake and $wing earnings last week. Turns its a chipotle problem not an industry problem. I guess sales go down when you charge more, give out less food, and treat customers like shit. This followed by general market tanking last week. This all to say its not PTLOs fault, its the market that's wrong!
* Daddy Powell cucking trump and won't cut rates. Yes generally small caps benefit from lower rates. They'd help PTLO thrive, but are not needed to survive and continue growing at a steady pace. Since jobs data got ""fixed"", maybe that changes sooner than later
* New restaurants performance. Growing pains IMO. Likely takes 1-2 years to reach maturity
* Poor stock performance. I call it opportunity.
* Cattle futures are to the moon. Think they've done pretty good keeping price up to offsets costs. Can they keep doing it?

Doesn't this chart look like shit? To the habitual top blaster sure. My personal strategy involves buying low and selling higher than that (not for everyone I know). Also a guy a X posted about this Wackoff guy and 2025 sure looks like Jackoffs CuMulation. If u google institutional ownership it is a whopping 97%. Smart money been stock piling to sell later to u chasers. Front run it for once in your life. Big SEXY volume rising into earnings. You know what moves tickers VOLUME.

You know how I know this shit can go? Cuz I already round tripped some shares this year. Lows under $8 to just under $16 and back where we are today. It was lonely at the top. I want to bring friends with me this time.

I regret nothing. I'm holding shares long enough to be marked long and pay as little taxes as possible like a true patriot. Besides just cuz I round tripped it doesn't mean I didn't pick up any souvenirs.

1mgxblh,2025-08-03,"ALL IN and Max Margins on SMCI !! My Rent Money, Dog's Eye Surgery Fund, Jacked to the Tits!  Either A5 or Instantaneous Ramen
**DD/TLDR Rocket Reason**

1. NVIDIA and all big tech are customers
2. 20% short interest - presumably because of financial reporting fears. SMCI went from 3 million shares short a quarter ago to 95 million shares short now (Fintel). I know finance and this is no longer a problem. SMCI clearly announced they Do Not Need to restate earnings and their auditors found no instances of fraud (given US laws, you don’t casually declare this on an earnings call). 
3. Meeting or even slightly beating earnings will squeeze the shorts’ balls blue. OPEN had a short interest of 20.73%, look what happened when it squeezed.
4. Massive expected INCREASE in AI spend. Ex: Recent Google earnings announced increase to $85 billion. X (Grok) working to launch millions of GPUs and shipping a “power plant” from Europe to power it. Every AI player (MSFT, META, AMZN, Open AI etc) will do the same increasing spend to the 70-90bill range. TSMC also reported great earnings. Clear sign demand is accelerating not slowing.
5. International expansion - SMCI won a Major Exclusive $20 billion DataVolt (Saudi Arabia) deal, Ericsson.
6. Raised 2.3 billion cash and sold 1.79 billion in receivables for expansion. Big-brain move at 0% interest with capped calls. They are currently generating cash and not burning it, which means the money is primarily for planned massive growth and expansion.
7. BofA Analist Ruplu Bhattacharya, has a $35 price target on SMCI, but had a price target of $1,090 at one point, which is a ridiculous joke. Big funds probably have major short positions and are now caught with their pants down and are using their Analist to beat prices down. They don’t know computers. If SMCI reports spectacular earnings on 8/5/2025, and their tits get squeezed, she’ll be relegated to OnlyFans.
You and the rest of WSB are bullish on their earnings so I hope you like ramen >I know finance and this is no longer a problem.

There we have it, folks $1090 pre split brotha I played this game once before and wound up a bag holder. Not doing SMCI again.

Sweet baby Jesus. 

We got tea leaves McGee over here folks! $UNH

Stephen Hemsley the CEO of $UNH watching the stock drop right now ... People forget that he was once a CFO and knows the value of strategic repurchases.

Step 1. Kitchen sink the quarter with super conservative Guidance...

Step 2. BUY BACK ALOT OF SHARES after market drops...

-> Currently Authorized to buy back 20M (7-8M were bought in Q2)

They're sitting in 32B in CASH... and still cash flowing at 16B per year right now, with cashflow increasing next year on margin recovery. 

With M&A window closed because of anti-trust... what do you think they'll do with the excess cash and shares trading at Covid lows?

20M shares @ 250/share = 5B... They were running 3B per Quarter before this earnings. Its likely they might use up the program and do another 5B next quarter... 

@ $8.80 / in div -> reducing the float by 20M -> saves 176M per year in DIV payments. 

With margin recovery next year and float thats projected to drop to 850M by year end of 2026... 

Even at 4% net income Margin (historically low) on $475B -> 19B in Net income. At 850M shares -> ~$22/share in EPS for 2026. 

at 4.5% net income Margin (historically low) on $500B -> 22.5B @ 815M shares (12B in repurchases) -> ~27/share in EPS for 2027.

EPS jump from 2025 ($16/share) to 2027($27/share)

Every share repurchased now saves on future cash to dividend and disproportionately boosts EPS.

With an investment grade credit rating and very few near term maturities... they could increase the leverage if need be.

(Plagiarized from someone smarter than me.) Rick. This might be true, but I wouldn’t agree about the technical basis aspect.

Welcome to the club my man! Hang in there! Luigi sends his regards It feels like every other post is about someone buying UNH this week. This sub has an obsession with buying stocks in clear downtrends bc once upon a time they were expensive.

They were doing the same thing with Intel last year. It's the old ""it used to cost a lot so it should cost spot fallacy"".

This stock has so much going against it. Politically the adminstration hates the company. They just missed earnings, twice in a row for the first time in like, seven years.

When stocks sell off 50% in a couple weeks, there's a reason.They just fired the CEO. These are not signs of a company that is going to do well anytime soon. On Tuesday they came out and said they were suspending guidance for 2025. Why the hell would they do that if this company is about to blow the lid off the next quarter.

The stock traded like a tech stock, and never should have. It's going to 200 which will be a proper valuation for a *healthcare* company with deep financial troubles. !remindMe 01/2027

Had been losing for past few days on SPY 0DTEs and NVO calls (don't catch the actual falling knife), so this is a nice change of scenery! 

Saw OKLO down to 68s yesterday after open, hence bought a few 0DTE calls and held all the way till 74 before momentum faded. Solid gains maybe partly from short squeeze too, and then saw that several other stocks had similar movements as well during that timeframe.

Good luck to everyone on the upcoming week! Can only hope to sustain some of the momentum. LFG!


Solid play. Recognized the momentum early and timed the exit well. Not chasing, just executing. Squeeze deez nuts you fuckin nerd.

Basically, did this twice just playing and well . . . But yeah held too long Hopefully didn't completely burn through your HOOD account and have to rely on your retirement funds for that gambling hook.  Let me guess, you held and lost? Done it, possibly hundreds of times. Eventually you learn. But still, some times if you let emotion sneak it you will do it again. That's the play. Either 1000% or 0%. Nothing between. 


It's just $40 tho. You're good.  Always take profits cheers Done that a few times lol and still didn’t sell im what you call a “dumbass”. Good thing it was only $8 I was planning to do a $1.2k play but stopped myself. Yuhhh lf my ass wasn’t a dumbass I’d probably retire by now

I closed the position just before market close yesterday just to watch it jump another 5% because of course it did. But I am happy to pocket 70% gain.

Vasg in some winners or you might be chasing the dragon forever down into the toilet.

I might jump back into this one if NVDA goes down a bit and creates a new opportunity.
How did it feel holding that through april? Wasn't super comfy but I kept reminding myself that Ai spending is still increasing and that Nvidia would be selling the Lion's share of that so it had to go back up. There wasn't really a good bear case against the company and arguably there still isn't.

1me28yi,2025-07-31,"🚀🚀 Why you should buy Unlimited New Heights (UNH) 🚀🚀
Ready to take your money to unlimited new heights? It’s time to buy UNH. 

The noise of medical costs eating profits from premium? Overhyped. 

Source: I work in the industry, and UNH doesn’t NEED to make profits from premiums to succeed. Think of premiums beating the amount you pay in medical costs for inforce policies as the cherry on top.

What should be focused on is gaining more policyholders and revenue growth (succeeded at). Why?

Because UNH isn’t in the medical industry, it’s in the banking industry. 

As an example, let’s say person A has total premiums of 1000 paid to UNH throughout the year. At year end, person A has erectile dysfunction and needs immediate assistance, and is covered for a doctor visit that cost UNH $1000. 

Sure- UNH didn’t make any money directly but they just got an interest free loan of $1000 to buy SPY calls. 

Position? Ass up, face down. 
133 shares @ 283, 100% of my portfolio 


do they make high end GPU's? If you like UNH @ 283, you'll like it better at 256, BUY THE FALLING KNIFE.

EDIT: 252 and still falling YOLOing my kid’s college fund into UNH rn. If it goes to zero, at least he’ll learn character. United NVIDIA Huang Can’t they donate $50M to Turmp and make the case disappear? Seems like a no brainer Federal investigation is just getting started. This is not the correct time for buying calls.

1me1vgr,2025-07-31,"$SNAP: Sneaky (undervalued) Agentic AI Player
SNAP is being valued like a struggling social media app, which it is. More importantly, as the last true social network it is a uniquely valuable dataset and data collection platform for the agentic AI era. 

**The Agentic AI Era**

""A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts. So, he loses touch with reality and lives in a world of illusions.""

-Alan Watts

LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) at this point have essentially solved language. After advances in model training approaches and hardware, this was a lot easier to do than expected, largely due to the vast and varied amount of digitized written text on the internet. 

While these products are already revolutionizing certain professions, the industry and investors are already looking to the next thing. There’s a couple ideas on the horizon. One is superintelligence (aka, Meta), turbocharged LLMs that are smarter than humans. The other is agentic functioning, AI that is designed to do things. Here, superintelligence is not as critical, performance is tied to social functioning as they interface with systems designed for people. 

Agentic AI can mean a few things and to varying degrees of complexity. Nearest to basic LLM, quasi-machine friendly systems, an AI agent may call your doctor's office for you and schedule an appointment with your receptionist. In more advanced but still mostly text-based forms, an AI agent may manage your calendar, negotiate simple purchases, or coordinate services with other AIs on your behalf. The larger stride in agentic AI is past digital and text based medium, into handling decision making on your behalf in real world contexts- think interacting with household objects, interpreting social signals, threat detection and protection.  This is the area of humanoid robotics, currently receiving massive investments from Telsa, and an inevitable target for the rest of the big tech players. 

Like with LLMs- sounds hard until it's not. The technical breakthrough will hinge in sourcing and leveraging ideal datasets. Tesla is currently training their Optimus robots on data streams like YouTube videos, but in terms of acting and behaving like humans, there is a non-public, unparalleled training dataset available. This is a dataset that will make humanoid robotic devices that need to be socially aware, navigate the world in context of social cues, and build trust relationships with owners. To be clear, it a critical piece to an LLM-sized breakthrough, and perhaps greater, in agentic AI. 

And unlike superintelligence (the nerdy kid who has read about how to be cool in books), performant agentic AI will be more impactful than superintelligence in the same manner as Chad, who has failed up his whole life due to his social prowess. 

**The Slow Death of the Social Network**

Before we look more in depth at SNAP, let's check in on the ""social media"" landscape. A social network is a platform where people who know each other use technology to improve or enhance their peer-to-peer or community engagements. Here's why they largely do not exist anymore:
 
Facebook: Ad delivery system for youths with little / no natural actual real world social dynamics present. Maybe still something of a social network for boomers, but boomers Facebook experience is also fairly corrupted by AI / brainrot content that they can’t distinguish from reality.

Tiktok/instagram: endless scroll, optimized for large content creators, little to organic peer to peer social aspects, not for people who know each other to talk with each other. 

Reddit: terminally online autists exchange asynchronous messages largely around upvote farming and out-cringing each other. 

Snap: The only at-scale platform where people still communicate directly with people they actually know. Core experience still chat, video, voice, maps, streaks (read small, high-frequency, high-context exchanges). True to what social networks were originally envisioned as, it’s a high-resolution behavioral mirror of human life, especially among younger generations, and still dominated by exchanges between socially adept individuals who have non-online relationships.
 
**Commercializing the Social SNAPshot**

It is speculative, yet perhaps unavoidable, that the largely undiluted true social network of SNAP will be discovered/reframed as a undervalued training dataset / continuous data collection platform for humanoid robotics training data. 

SNAP's dataset is ideal for training large, transformer architecture which are natively tolerant of multimedia inputs. Life is a multimedia experience: spoken word, visual expressions and reactions, and written communications all blend and associated within the rich relationships captured within the platform. Tapping into these data streams, and the complex social graphs, allow training data to essentially capture not just the multimedia experience of being human, but even the cadence. A popular concept in Jazz is that brilliance lies in the rests between played notes: similarly, in true relationships, the timing between responses, and the media inputs which dictate the cadence of responses, is likely hugely influencing in teaching human like machines not just how, but when, to respond, which will have a huge bearing on social aptitude of these systems. Think of the feelings you would have towards a system that is programmed to reach out 24 hours after not hearing from you, versus one that knows to reach out at the right time to connect with you, comfort you, or even challenge you. Combine the rich multimedia experience and temporal component, multiply it across a web of remarkably lifelike social exchanges, and you arrive at something singular: the closest thing we have to a behavioral training ground for humanlike machines.

If we can accept the value of what SNAP is sitting on, let's discuss the moat. An important aspect of this dataset is that it is not publicly discoverable, which should help for monetization. Reddit’s stock price inflated massively when the market began to price in its value for AI training, however, Reddit’s training dataset is largely exposed to the internet making it easy to steal, which hampers pricing and put them a step behind in monetizing this. SNAP can control access, and therefore pricing, from an earlier stage, potentially making their dataset proportionally more valuable than companies where their training dataset is on display to the world like Reddit or LinkedIn. 

Could a larger player simply stand up a true social network to tap these human dynamics? My thesis is that they could not. Social media worked prior to our knowledge of what they were and what they would become. Given the slow bleed of true social behaviors on these platforms, and the immense value they have produced (extracted) from the social landscape, newcomers are met with skepticism and an almost repulsion from most people. SNAP has two important qualities that provide a huge amount of inertia and competitive advantage: it was early enough to establish credibility before the public grew wary of social platforms, and it's popular with youth - a group that’s still highly social, less curated in their expression, and embedded in environments like school where dense social graphs naturally form. 

The ship may have sailed to create another SNAP: what SNAP has in the last true social network, may not just be valuable, but foundational. SNAP is not likely the company to build the devices, nor would need to train the models, but with the right acquisition or partnerships, they can play the kingmaker in agentic AI training. 

**Who's going to tell SNAP? Risks to the thesis**

\- Delayed Agentic AI Era

* The necessary hardware for embodied AI and humanoid robotics may take longer to mature.
* If that happens, the window to monetize SNAP’s dataset may arrive too late for the company to benefit or even survive.
* However, SNAP still appears undervalued on fundamentals alone: revenue is growing, debt is declining, valuation remains at the low end of social media peers

\- SNAP Fails to Realize Its Own Value

Snap may never recognize the strategic importance of its dataset to agentic AI. If so, it risks:

* Shifting toward META-style algorithmic feed optimization, which could erode the organic human interaction that makes its data valuable (already, arguably, in progress)
* Overcommitting to hardware wearables, which may enrich data types but not outweigh the diversion in focus from platform-level AI opportunity
* Undervaluing its data in licensing or partnership deals due to lack of awareness

\- Execution Risk

* Successfully transitioning from a consumer social platform to a data infrastructure or licensing company requires different leadership, strategic vision, and monetization models.
* SNAP may not be equipped to make that leap on its own.

Even if SNAP can't figure it out on their own, the market will likely step in on its behalf. As the agentic AI revolution takes shape and hyperscalers hit walls trying to model social nuance, SNAP’s position as a uniquely rich behavioral dataset will become increasingly difficult to ignore. And of course, if SNAP figures this out, they can optimize their platform to maximize data retention, cohesion, and social modeling to best prepare for the agentic AI opportunity. 

**The play**

I am in for 25k in shares, and planning to keep adding to the position. I might consider an exit if the forward looking impression of SNAP changes to account for these ideas and generate a quick 10x, otherwise I let it ride as the agentic AI era takes off.

1mdqn7u,2025-07-31,"AMZN YOLO
Sold these and a couple other strikes unsecured back in May because I wanted exposure but also some dividend income while i'm going to school in japan.  Seeing as we are up to $238 over night and based on meta and Microsoft earnings AMZN is probably also going to smash it.  Honestly not sure the best way to adjust this position.  I knew we would get to a new ATH but wasn't expecting it this fast.  I'm tempted to roll them up to $260 strikes or maybe with the extra buying power sell more $240s?
I think it will slide at some point, but it's hot now, and will probably be up at the end of year...so I'd be careful about end of summer or early next year dates. The ""I need dividend income for school in Japan so I'll sell unsecured puts"" strategy is my new favorite. A true scholar.

Honestly, being up almost $5,500 is a good problem to have. If you think AMZN is going to keep running, rolling up to the $260 strike is just collecting more of that sweet, sweet ""dividend"" premium.

1mdf1wf,2025-07-30,"DD on $SNAP…The Path to Breaking $11 in the Coming Weeks
Hey everyone,
Alright, let's talk about a name that many have written off: Snap Inc. ($SNAP). I know it's been a volatile and often frustrating stock to own, but I've been watching the price action and the recent news closely, and I believe we're seeing the setup for a potential breakout above the $11 mark in the next few weeks.
Here's my bull thesis, broken down into a few key points.
1. The Technical Picture is Improving
From a technical analysis (TA) perspective, $SNAP is starting to look constructive.
 * Consolidation Base: The stock has been carving out a solid base in the $9.30-$9.40 range for a while now. This period of consolidation after a downtrend can often precede a move higher.
 * Psychological Barrier at $10: The $10 level is a huge psychological hurdle. We've seen the stock test it, get rejected, and then reclaim it. A sustained hold above $10 would be very bullish and could attract momentum traders.
 * Next Resistance: If we hold above $10, the next logical area of resistance on the chart is right around $11-$11.25. Given the right catalyst, a push to test this level seems highly probable.
2. The Amazon Catalyst is Under-appreciated
The partnership allowing users to buy products from Amazon directly through Snapchat ads is a game-changer, in my opinion.
 * Closing the Loop: This move directly addresses a major weakness for $SNAP: ad attribution and return on investment (ROI). It makes it much easier for advertisers to see a direct conversion from an ad view to a sale.
 * Higher Ad Value: As the ROI becomes clearer and more potent, Snap can command higher prices for its ad inventory. This is a direct tailwind for Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), a key metric. The formula for revenue is essentially DAU \times ARPU. While Daily Active Users (DAU) growth is modest, boosting ARPU is the fastest way to grow the top line.
3. Snapchat+ is a Silent Success Story
Snapchat's subscription service, Snapchat+, is quietly building a significant, high-margin revenue stream. They recently surpassed 5 million subscribers. While this isn't a massive number on its own, it proves two things:
 * A core group of users is willing to pay for enhanced features.
 * It diversifies revenue away from being 100% reliant on advertising, which is crucial in a tough macroeconomic environment.
4. Sentiment is Still Overwhelmingly Negative
Let's be honest, the market hates this stock. It's been beaten down for so long that any piece of good news is met with skepticism. This is exactly the kind of environment where a sentiment reversal can cause an aggressive rally. The stock is far from its all-time highs, and a short-term re-rating doesn't seem out of the question as the business fundamentals slowly improve.
Risks to Consider:
 * Competition: TikTok is a monster, and Meta's Reels are always a threat. Snap needs to continue innovating to keep its user base engaged.
 * Macro Headwinds: Ad spending is highly cyclical. If we enter a significant economic downturn, $SNAP's ad revenue will take a hit, regardless of their new features.
 * Execution: Management has to deliver. Any missteps on an earnings call or bad guidance could send the stock spiraling back down.
Conclusion / TL;DR:
The combination of a constructive technical chart, a powerful and under-hyped catalyst with the Amazon partnership, and growing high-margin subscription revenue makes a compelling case for $SNAP. With the stock building support above the key $10 level, I believe it has the momentum to test and break through $11 in the coming weeks.
Positions: Long 985 shares of $SNAP.
Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I am just a random person on the internet sharing my own research and opinions. Please do your own due diligence before making any investment decisions.

The instagram girl I've been gooning over has recently switched to posting on snap, that's all the DDs I need  If there's one tip I can give about snap, do not hold your calls or puts through earning. It has crashed 8 of the last 10 earnings. Been watching this sucker for year. I’m going all in. gooner nation represent Senator, we run ads. Sell the news, and don't gamble on things you can't predict I think after i turned 20, i stopped using it. Most people around my age stopped using snapchat (20-28). It’s a platform for teens. Youtube, instagram and tiktok takes up most of the ad space for my age group Management kills the stock, last quarter they gave no guidance SNAP will never succeed with Evan Spiegel at the helm.

When you buy an option the other side is a market maker, and they always hedge their exposure, so unless SPY gaps up $30 overnight they will simply slowly accumulate shares as it approaches the strike price. They could also hedge via futures or by other option positions. 

And if someone is sitting on that many shares of SPY and it jumps over $30 in a week they are not going to be losing sleep over that return. Only loser here is OP by donating to the market. Please don’t keep these.

1mbhay2,2025-07-28,"Why I'm all in on Digital Ocean, a totally Undervalued Play in Cloud Infrastructure
Been a DOCN  customer for several years and they are killing it with new AI tools and are so undervalued as detailed below. 

It’s trading under $30 per share with under $3 billion market cap, the company trades under 4x revenue while comparable but larger CoreWeave trades at like 20x revenue.

Digital Ocean generated $781 million in revenue during 2024 with healthy 13% growth and impressive 42% EBITDA margins, delivering $84 million in net income. Meanwhile, CoreWeave remains cash-flow negative while burning through capital for infrastructure expansion.

Digital Ocean's AI transformation is accelerating rapidly, with AI annual recurring revenue growing over 160% year-over-year. The company has strategically positioned itself in the developer-focused segment with simplified GPU offerings and a comprehensive GenAI platform launched in early 2025. This developer-first approach serves 600,000+ customers across a diversified base, contrasting sharply with CoreWeave's dependence on large enterprise contracts that create concentration risk.

Digitial Ocean’s stock price should easily double or more. If Digital Ocean achieved just half of CoreWeave's revenue multiple at 9x, the stock would trade around $56, representing 100% upside. A more appropriate AI cloud valuation of 12x revenue would drive the stock to $84, delivering 200% returns. Did I mention, Digital Ocean is actually profitable….
""All in"" = less than 5% of your port.  Solid pick though When I'm playing no limit Texas Hold'em, I go all in with 5% of my chips. Catches my opponents off guard every time and they fold. Been using the same $5 droplet for the last 10 years. Not sure about the prospect, I use AWS professionally, but digitalocean personally for more than 10 years now. I prefer DO over google cloud and aws due to the ease of usage. We swapped out of digital ocean to aws because whatever they offered, aws offered and much much more. You just need us to get you out the negative I prefer to go all in with my feelings. No money risked, just FOMO when the stock skyrockets. That’s a fucking red flag if I ever seen one. Fuck MF and their bullshit. That has been the story in the past. DO was cheaper but AWS was just better.

DO under new CEO is innovating faster and launched many new features including VPC, many managed services like opensearch, K8 improvements, etc. [https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/tags/product-updates](https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/tags/product-updates)

1mapebj,2025-07-27,"$GOOGL | Reports of Search’s Death Have Been Greatly Exaggerated, NEW ATH INCOMING
Position: $200c 8/1 @ .64 a contract. Over 32,000 in OI and 35,000 in volume on Friday. Someone is betting for a squeeze. 

THE DUE DILIGENCE:  

EDIT: EU TRADE DEAL JUST ANNOUNCED, THIS IS A MULTIBAGGER NOW.

• The market sits at record highs. Google closed Friday under 193 only seven percent below the 52 week high of 207.05.

• Chart set l up looks clean. A cup and handle that began mid February already cleared the neckline. Last week was month end options expiration (an important date when market makers square their books) so the 195 pin made sense. Price paused at 195 and then fell under it because call open interest there was huge. Dealers pinned it with about 9.5 thousand contracts at that strike. Those contracts expired and the lid comes off.

• $70 billion buyback cannon:
In April the board reloaded the repurchase program with another $70 billion. That’s ~5 % of market cap sitting in the wings to sop up any weakness. 

Quiet period freeze out: Most U.S. companies, including Google, impose an internal “blackout” on discretionary buybacks that starts 2 to 4 weeks before quarter end and lasts through at least two full trading days after the earnings release. The gap lets any fresh information settle so repurchases don’t look like insider trading. 
- Q2 numbers dropped Tuesday night, 23 July.
- Add the standard two trading day buffer (Wed + Thu).
- Friday, 26 July was the first “open” day when the $70 billion authorization could swing back to full size assuming no other material events pending and no stricter internal policy.

• Low option pricing. Weekly call implied volatility is twenty six to thirty percent. That is cheap. If price and volume lift, gamma forces dealers to chase and calls can move fast.

• Pre earnings run absorbed the beat. Shares ran about fifteen percent into the July print, so the pop was priced in. That sets up a fresh leg this week once positioning resets.

• Search is not dying. Q2 numbers show Google Search and Other revenue of 54.19 billion dollars, up 12 percent year over year. The AI doom story is broken.

• Why AI will not steal the core. Large language models still stumble on location needs like “pizza near me,” “hotels in Miami,” or live directions. They also fail when users treat the bar as an address book and type “chase bank customer service contact” or “x dot com login.” Habit wins and Google owns that habit.

• Valuation is still light.

-Google PE 20.6, PEG about 1.0

-Microsoft PE 39.7, PEG roughly 3.3

Microsoft carries nearly double the earnings multiple and more than triple the growth adjusted multiple even though both compete head-to-head in cloud and AI.

• Macro tail wind. The index is breaking higher, liquidity is strong and tech leads when that happens. Google should print a new all time high above 207 this week if it clears 195 with volume.

• Longer view. When Google’s text-to-video tool can pump out five to ten minute clips with story flow, every creator will upload straight to YouTube. That adds a whole new layer of ads on top of the current engine and is a self contained flywheel on steroids. 

• Capex fears flipped to bullish. Some investors initially balked at Google’s surge in capital spending, but that knee jerk worry faded fast, being bearish on strategic investment is, frankly, dumb. It’s like a wife who wanted to be a stay at home mom getting mad at you for working too much. Also, the spend is a one off hit, and Google has a decade long record of turning big capex into bigger returns. That one time off hit was already consumed given the initial reaction to earnings, so it can be ignored now. A slowdown in spending would be the real red flag, signalling the company had lost its confidence in the AI arms race against OpenAI, xAI, and Meta.

• Cloud flips from drag to driver:
Google Cloud just printed $2.8 billion in operating income with a 20.7 % margin, nearly double last year’s margin. It’s no longer the “break-even someday” segment. it’s a profit engine that diversifies away from ads.

Game plan
I am watching the 200 and 205 calls expiring this week. A close above 195 with volume is the trigger. Low IV plus a move toward the 52 high can send those contracts flying. 
I have several gmail accounts and always click the ads. u couldnt post this back in april - june?  ofc lets wait til it hit 190 then come up with your bullshit DD and yell to the moon after it’s up like 30%.  WSB never fail Thanks for your service There were tons of bullish GOOGL posts over the last 18 months nearly every freaking day, you guys just don’t keep attention when sentiment is bad because you go with the herd.

Not in the immediate future, Zuck is still sitting on a massive money printing enterprise, but the fact he's going around in a panic mode trying to recruit top AI talent and throwing hundreds of millions and even $1 billion tells me everything (almost everything) Meta has done on AI front has failed and he's realizing that he has a very small window to change course or Meta is forever left out of the AI race.

His dream/quest is to convert the billions of current eyeballs into an AI-controlled dystopia with AI friends/assistants recommending products and services not to mention the stupid Metaverse idea, but if after dumping $100s of billions into CapEx these last several years, he's probably now realizing he doesn't have the right solutions and these latest moves reek of panic and desperation in my opinion. 

Disclosure: I have a variety of 2026/2027 short positions, and will enter new positions on the likelihood of an earnings beat Wednesday and stock pumping as usual.

TL;DR: META is fucked, change my mind. 


They should just hire whoever programmed Zuck Huh? Yeah, a company making tons of money and investing in talent is ALWAYS on the brink of collapse… Lol. Meta is definitely not cooked. They are one of the best ai companies to date. 

Not everything AI is LLM. Meta fucking kills it in computer Vision. 

Not trying to change your mind, but meta still has a lot of runway.

You wanna talk dead? Talk about Apple. They have straight up given up on innovation imo Meta is like the one big tech stock I would keep buying out of the rest. Majority of their money comes from advertising « The meta platform have begun to stagnate » You should start reading actual Meta reports and actual revenues and growth in customers and stop listening to people. It’s the same old Netflix like comments for a decade now. Has anyone tried turning him off and turning him on again? Also, nearly half their revenue is from Instagram. The broccoli head kids love the gram. Really? Google is the best currently in my eyes. But I also own MSFT and AMZN. Only adding to Google just now.

1m9zqmd,2025-07-26,"Rate Cuts At Next FOMC?
From my understanding rate cuts are typically bullish but not when they're done in fear or a recession (or possibly because trump is ""bullying"" the Fed). I believe the tariffs taking effect on August 1st coupled with a possible ""bearish"" rate cut at the next FOMC will be a precursor to a big correction. Is my understanding above correct? I believe this ""non-stop pump"" we've had the past several years are prepping for a big correction, institutions trying to sell off as much as they can but still keeping price action moving upwards. When the correction does come, it won't devastate their holdings as bad as it could. I also believe , in part, that healthcare has been getting purposely beaten down but everyone is ""buying"".

I'm sorry, was I watching a different news feed than you the other night? Powell isn't afraid of Trump and he isn't going to bend over. Also he's only one vote out of 12. The majority of other voting members of the fed are not on board with rate cuts. Furthermore, the odds of a rate cut currently sit at 4.3%. Those aren't winning odds friend. https://preview.redd.it/1whf7okxc9ff1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd48dc4475ce2321753482c228f90c0710ea0c48

# All 0DTE TESLA options,1hr to close.
  
Played TSLA up, made money. Not much , like 3-4k. The real party started when I swapped to puts. Made 30k in about 30 seconds. 1k/second avg. Trailing stops with runners as it kept going. Clean exit on the gnarly V.  

The buyin for this was 1520et, 0dte, -8k.  
Final sale happened at 1529et, +30k. The real fun started at 1526et when it dropped, instantly making 16k. Trailing stops and so on.  
Would have made probably 2x this but like a responsible regarding yoloer, I did trailing stops. Fight me.

Rejoice in meme boy's demise. We can only hope it keeps going down. 
Ya I bought $330 8/1 calls yesterday at 1.65, sold for a measly 2.65 and watched it run to 5.85 before it fell off Profit is profit. My hands are made of paper when I’m winning, then I get caught bag holding and they turn into diamonds Stops on entry. I learned this week. Enter and immediately set a stop at your loss you want. As it goes up, increase your stopping. Set a goal (30%,40%,50%, etc) for trailing some sells as you start rocking up. Leave runners and continue moving the stops up. Make sure, since It's tesla, you leave a good cushion for random movements. I always give a .1 cushion for sub $1 positions. As it moves up more and more, make it like a .15 cushion so you can let it ride if it starts to do a fakeout correction. I am learning a LOT about scalping this week. What prompted you to go in 0dte puts that late in the day? Can you show me?

Congrats, your balls definitely worth more than 20k now The pump seemed like a huge fakeout liquidity opportunity. I think retail was fomoing in as regards do, and institutions added fire to it to stoke the fomo. Then they just started unloading profits on retail. Institutions want nothing to do with that flaming dumpster fire. It's on its way down and out. I also am a moron. I was planning to do it with 50k, but opted for a safer amount.

My last post got removed. Reposting in a more civil manner. Sorry Gay Mods.

I posted this before earnings: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1m46fuj/googles\_ai\_awakening\_earnings\_bull\_case/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1m46fuj/googles_ai_awakening_earnings_bull_case/)

**My Thesis is Simple:**

The market is acting emotionally, and I'm acting rationally. The post-earnings price drop was a textbook case of IV crush combined with a market overreaction. While everyone was freaking out about the intraday swing, the actual long-term story only got stronger.

This dip to $191 was great, for my covered calls I sold.

Here’s why I’m not sweating the daily noise:

1. **The $106 Billion Backlog:** This isn't a forecast. It's a backlog of committed orders, mostly for their high-margin cloud and AI services. This is future revenue that's already on the books.
2. **The $85 Billion CapEx:** This isn't speculative spending. They are building the infrastructure required to service that massive backlog. They are investing in the machinery to print cash for the next five years.
3. **The AI Moat:** Gemini's integration across the entire Google ecosystem (Search, Workspace, Cloud) is a long-term catalyst that the market is still struggling to price correctly.

People who sold today traded a long-term winning strategy for short-term fear. I believe the path to a $3 Trillion valuation ($250/share) is clear, and the market just gave us a beautiful discount.

we march on to 250!
TSLA gets a ridiculous valuation because there was a chance they’d solve the driverless car problem.  Well Waymo’s already solved the driverless car problem and is selling millions of rides.  Yet Waymo is valued at a pathetic $75 billion.  Google should be way more valuable with the break through Waymo’s have made If it hits $188 I’m throwing 20k at the longest dated leap calls they have It was 170 2 weeks ago Never heard of this noname company, but count me in The breaking point will be Google putting their level 4 driverless tech into any car brand that wants to partner with them. why not a 36 wheeler and double their money? I think they need to get it into an 18 wheeler, that’s where the money is. Worst case we get a fine and write it off. Sundar has enough change in his couch cushions to cover it. If there is a break up, share holders benefit from owning stock in two companies and a higher evaluation. one of my most bullish positions too. 12 long calls, started buying since feb after nancy pelosi's leaps disclosure. scooped up 5 at one shot during the dip to 150 in May. holding out till at least 200-210 and probably converting 1-2 contracts into shares

Doing puts in a bullish market lmaoooo The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent Ive done this too. I have a hypothesis about this. When we’re making a bullish bet, we sell because we have high confidence that it’s a good time to take profit, it feels like things are about to turn around. Maybe even we’re selling on a pullback. Then, that confidence gets the best of us and we think, yeah… it’s heading down any minute. So we buy puts. I’ve had to retrain myself that a good time to take long profit isn’t the same as a good time to go short. Buy calls on dips but never puts on rips.

1m7jtf4,2025-07-23,"Alphabet Q2 Earnings
Alphabet Inc. reported strong financial results for Q2 2025, with revenues reaching $96.4 billion, a 14% increase year-over-year.

The growth was driven by double-digit increases across Google Services, YouTube ads, and Google Cloud, which saw a remarkable 32% rise in revenues.

Operating income also grew by 14% to $31.3 billion, maintaining an operating margin of 32.4%. Net income increased by 19% to $28.2 billion, and EPS rose 22% to $2.31, surpassing the estimated EPS of $2.15.

CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted the company’s leadership in AI and the strong performance of new AI features in Search and Cloud. Alphabet also announced plans to increase capital expenditures to $85 billion in 2025, reflecting confidence in future growth opportunities.
But can YouTube deliver +10% stock growth on -20% revenue? YouTube by itself is larger than whole Tesla. Actually even the YouTube ads are earning about the same as all of Tesla combined. Tomorrow -5%? Markets seem to undervalue the fact that GOOG is clear #1 AI player at the moment: While paid usage is still trailing after OpenAI (as strong #2), they have built the full stack from content, to social media, to AI talent, to top performing models, to custom HW, to cloud infra for AI in the past 10+ years. This is unbeatable position on AI. it dipped to -4% for a moment already.


I recon its gonna go up again in a week

edit: hasnt been 10 minutes since this post, its already green To me it looks that Google's base ad business is healthy and a bit undervalued. At the same time, it has amazing emerging businesses: Google Cloud (+32% Y/Y), Waymo (owns the emerging market), and #1 full-stack AI (content-talent-model-hw-cloud).

OTOH, Tesla highly 5-10x overvalued. When comparing Google to others:

* Nvidia has 2/6: HW, Talent
* Amazon has 1.5/6: Cloud, some HW
* Microsoft has 2.5/6: Talent, Models (from OpenAI), Cloud
* Anthropic has 2/6: Talent, Models
* OpenAI has 2/6: Talent, Models
* xAI has: 4/6: Talent, Models, Compute, Social media
* Meta has: 4.5/6: Talent, Compute, Social media, Content, (weaker) Models

IMO Google's (6/6) position of having all of these is very unique:

* Content: Amazing library of content built by hand (scanning) and YouTube over decades
* Social media: YouTube creates new timely content at top pace every day. Meta, Reddit, and X are the only contenders here.
* AI talent: Google has been losing talent — they were the contender #1 some years back, but still retain amazing team
* Top models: Here OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic been shoulder to shoulder for a while. xAI is trying to get to the party.
* Custom HW: TPU v7 is amazing — beating the best chips from Nvidia. Google's choice of not selling them to others is strange — they could take 50% of NVIDIAs business here. On this note, why no-one has acquired Cerebras yet? Their inference speed is way beyond everyone else and could really elevate Microsoft, Amazon, or Meta (or even Apple). Part of the Google advantage is their amazing HW; taking small Cerebras from the market would give the same for someone else.
* Cloud infra: In the end of the day nothing else matters if you do not have the compute. OpenAI had to start buying from their #1 competitor (Google) to continue to scale. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, xAI, and maybe even Oracle are the only ones here. xAI is still executing amazingly but are not sharing the compute. \+20% EPS YoY is so insane for a company with this much earnings No. According to stockholders they should expand violently while not spending any money at all.

1m7h10s,2025-07-23,"[DD] Applied Digital - $APLD - Slept On Data Center Stock with a Real Business Growth Story and Huge Potential
Reposting with positions since removed

TLDR: Stock go up 

Applied Digital owns and leases data centers for hyper scaler clients. In plain english… AI. While there is a buttload of competition in this space, there is an even larger buttload of money.

OpenAI recently agreed to pay $30B per year to Oracle for data centers leasing. APLD also recently signed a $7B lease contract with CoreWeave with the option to expand the lease by more than double the current MW as APLD builds out additional data center capabilities. Keep in mind that as AI adoption grows, data centers prices rise. OpenAI and Google are both prime examples of these price increases, as both organizations have and plan to continue to jack up prices as demand increases. Higher prices = higher revenues for APLD.

Applied Digital also has $5 billion in funding secured from Macquarie with $900M being used for current buildout and $4.1B for expansion. Perfectly situated to capitalize on the opportunity in hand.

So what are the catalysts? The better question is what aren’t the catalysts.

Current market cap is just shy of $2.5B with $5B in funding and $7B contract…

An additional lease signing could drive the stock 2-10x as APLD has the funding to expand operations without the need for additional dilution. As the CoreWeave money comes in, higher than expected margins would also trigger a powerful re-assessment of valuation. Trump could announce additional AI and data center investment/tax incentives/etc…

Now if you’ve made it this far and know anything about the stock, you might have realized something… I haven’t even mentioned the fact that 35% of the float is short. With so many potential catalysts that could increase the value exponentially, this is just the cherry on top.

My short term price target is $15-20 with a 3 year target of $80.

Position: 10,000 shares
Been in since around $5. Good company. The bull case for APLD is around energy... its data centers are located in North Dakota which has an abundance of nat gas and nuclear energy. It's the cheapest kilowatt hour in the nation and APLD has the contracts to build more facilities next to every major transformer hub/substation in the state. The cold climate will also help with cooling for the majority of the year, driving down operating cost. Finally, they have an exclusive partnership with SMCI for clusters, switches and stacks, and with CRWV for NVDA cards. I'm in 4,000 shares at 9.45 average and buying every dip close to 10. The nerds at Level1Tech on Youtube just did a full tour of the latest datacenter... it's worth watching. You got in a good price, $15-20 short term is about right. APLD is in early stage, once it’s ripe, it’ll 🚀🚀🚀 Too long

Didn't read

Nice JPEG's

I'm in I saw DD, I bought Is is till a good time to buy? 1-3 months in my opinion I’ll scoop a couple thousand shares. And set my stop loss at 9. Let’s run it. In my opinion, anything under $15 is a great buy. Anything under $20 is still a good buy. Beyond that is certainly high speculation, but still very early and I believe the potential is well worth the risk, especially compared to the big boys The average analyst target price the next year is above $13.

Bought this on a random discord callout I saw on monday afternoon, took a look at the chart and thought that it looked good. Didn’t think too much and decided to get 3 contracts since I’ve used up all my BP from daytrading some SPY contracts earlier.

Woke up this morning and got the biggest surprise I’ve ever found. Caught the move of a lifetime. Biggest % gain easily in my past couple years of trading.

Looking to make back some of the losses from my previous post. Cutting down risk and focusing on consistency. Gains like these really help though.

Bet you were watching this with your Apple Watch beeping every candle All that for 1700 dollars? Why is this actually my life 🤣 cackling be honest how low did they go The right play depends on if the dealers card is at least a 7 Hitting 5% gain twice in a day is good.  Just do that for 7 days, including your profits, and you've doubled.  Then take your initial off the table and you're playing with free money.

But I doubt you can do this for 7 days. Wow be careful don’t get caught for 5% return why not just by a leveraged ETF like 2 or 4xSPY. Be less risk and prob made more. 1710+1764= $3474

1m6nkyf,2025-07-22,"$110K on RKT Calls Now.  Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop
After having initiated a $61K position yesterday and posting about it, I saw the following headline and immediately upped my position to $110K:

TACO:  WE ARE THINKING ABOUT NO TAXES ON CAPITAL GAINS ON HOUSES

If this indeed comes to pass, RKT easily doubles in value as every business segment in their housing ecosystem should blow earnings estimates out of the water for the rest of TACO’s term in office.

This is the best risk-adjusted play in the housing sector right now in my opinion.  Sharp shops like ValueAct and Citron clearly agree.

GL out there.
Doesn’t taco say a lot of shit tho?  I mean basically anything that comes to his mind whether it’s actually doable or not 🚀🚀🚀 And like that, you've convinced me Yes in as well, but with a closer expiration than you. 


It gets a bit of tailwind as an over-shorted stock, but also is a value play and an interest rate/policy play as well. 


So much lining up for longs on $RKT I still like OPEN but its already had a significant run so it might be in a digestion period near term.  RKT just broke to YTD highs and the momentum is unstoppable at the moment. I'm also IN > making houses more attainable 

This would do the opposite though? No capital gains taxes on houses means theyre even better as investments, which means more are bought as investment properties and less are available / affordable for people trying to buy a house as a home.

Sequel to Margin Call coming soon
Wake me up when I can use fartcoin as collateral to buy more cumcoin Not much different than giving loan against TSLA shares https://preview.redd.it/49dhlpye2def1.jpeg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c5bea93c95952e40d78312588fe54aa1f3df62a6 Yeah can you imagine the cascade of margin calls once one of those starts dropping?  I don't think they're traded enough to hold up against sustained selling, even the biggest ones, and there's no automatic circuit breakers to stop it and give people time to regroup like the stock market. Poopcoin users are about to buy a house > They don't have to liquidate, they can just take the coins and sit on them.

That's not how margin calls work - no bank is going to sit on collateral that's rapidly dropping in value.  They get sold unless you can put up alternate collateral before that happens, and your loan gets zeroed out.  

That's the whole point of margin percentages, to give the bank time to liquidate you before your collateral drops below the value of your loan.  You may be unhappy that they sold your asset while it was worth less than you think it should be worth, but banks don't gamble on prices bouncing back. They're gonna give you garbage rates and loan amounts even lower than if you used your stock holdings as collateral.

It's easy money. It's less about the collateral amounts and more about the liquidity in a downturn.  Once people start being liquidated at a faster rate than the market can bear then all those loans collapse in a spiral, with the most recent and highest leveraged ones driving down the price as they're liquidated enough to margin call the next tier, and so forth. While Tesla may still crash, it’s an actual asset, and their calculation aims towards actual recovery value. Same with all assets they accept. This will be different and much riskier, unsecured never ends well in large numbers. That’s not how this works at all. They will have to liquidate, and the reason most investors aren’t jumping at the companies switching to crypto (as opposed to primary business which thus is speculative), it’s a sign the actual assets are failing.

1m64ba8,2025-07-22,"NVDA will see a massive correction as the ai bubble pops
Everyone and their mom thinks AI will replace humans, send us to the nearest star, and grant us immortalityall within the next five years. I can't even scroll online without seeing the word ""AI."" AI this, AI that. But here's what I've learned from the crypto and NFT crazes: when everyone thinks something will change the world, it usually goes the exact opposite direction.

I expect a **massive spike up in NVDA** after the Fed lowers rates, but give it a year or two max, and reality is going to hit us like a freight train, bro. **AI is the most massive bubble we have ever seen**, and the reckoning will be worse than the housing market crash. Here are my main reasons why:

1. **AI is the greatest illusion of our time.** I've used ChatGPT plenty. It's great at generating word salad and generic code, but when it comes to doing **ACTUAL work** or fixing real problems, it just gives you more word salad instead of solutions. They claim AI can pass the hardest math tests? Sure, it can, because they've already fed it the answers. Try this: go to ChatGPT or any AI model and give it five documents with daily returns for five stocks. Ask it to generate a table showing each company's return for every six-month interval. All models will fail. Not only would it take ages, but it would require running Python code to even attempt it, instead of just giving you the direct answer.
2. **The biggest players in the industry CEOs, VCs, investment fund heads who are throwing the most money around have zero technical skills and absolutely no idea how LLMs actually work.** They're either straight-up lying to pump up their stocks, or they're genuinely retarded, thinking something that runs on a Mac Studio is intelligent or anything close to that. CEOs are always right, right? Remember when Zuck renamed his entire company after the metaverse? That same guy said AI would replace all developers by mid-2025. Well, here we are in mid-2025, and not only has Meta paid the most money ever for a developer, but guess what? They have 2,000 job openings for engineers!
3. **All these keynotes promoting AI seem specifically tailored for investors they don't care about anyone else.** It's like they're screaming, ""BUY OUR STOCK, IT WILL GO TO THE MOON,"" but they can't legally say it. Jensen Huang has been openly mocking Masayoshi Son about selling NVDA stock at every public appearance, almost like he'll do the same to you if you sell!
4. **So far, companies have invested massively and saved very little money.** Microsoft, for example, recently claimed they saved $500 million because of AI, but they also invested $50 billion. The media went into a frenzy reporting on how much money they saved, as if $500 million is a great return on $50 billion.
5. **In Silicon Valley, the craziness has reached unimaginable heights.** Everyone and their dog has an AI startup getting $50 million in seed money, promising ""agentic AI models"" that will analyze your cat's poop and order Amazon food based on its constipation levels. On LinkedIn alone, there are 20,000 job openings in San Francisco for AI engineers, while there are only about 1,000 actual AI engineers available. Companies like Meta are paying $200 million for top engineers.
6. **There's almost no competitive advantage anymore, as open-source models are nearly as good as private ones.** All the big companies are monopolies in their fields. How can you maintain a monopoly when your product is free, open source, and runs on a Mac Studio?
7. **All major AI companies have predicted AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) would be here by now.** Yet, AGI is always ""one year away.""
8. **When everyone thinks something will happen, it always goes the other direction.**
9. **Big, revolutionary changes have never happened in a year or two.** The internet, for example, took 20 years to achieve mass adoption.

1m5z0mb,2025-07-21,"Need to diversify from NVDA after 5,508% gain
Around 10 years ago (I don’t remember which year exactly) I was sitting in the cafeteria at work, and the table next to me was talking about what a great stock NVDA was. I did a little search, and put $1000 which was the most I had ever invested in one stock at a time up to that point. 

Fast forward to now, that $1000 has grown by over $74,000 and 5,508%. 

This singular stock is the majority of my portfolio outside of my 401k. I don’t want to lose it all if it suddenly crashes, and not sure what I should do. Would love ideas! 

If it helps, I’m 43, most of my portfolio is in real estate properties, I have a small 401k which is in lifecycle funds. 

Between 401k, stocks, and crypto I have about $350,000.

1m5yp45,2025-07-21,"Muted Results but Booming Guidance: NVDA Q2 Earnings Analysis
**TL;DR at the bottom--I broke my wrist touching grass last weekend so this** ***is*** **the short version**

This is my third consecutive quarter posting an independent analysis of NVDA’s quarterly earnings. My Q4 FY25 and Q1 FY26 estimates are available on my profile, and a comparison to analyst consensus and actual results in those quarters can be seen below.

[Note 2025Q1 Refers to Non-GAAP H20 Excluded](https://preview.redd.it/mmfycac78bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f6bdebbe39904b4b4e944ef04c1020325685bdf)

[While Analysts Consistently Underestimate Revenue, My Bullish Bias has Decreased Significantly](https://preview.redd.it/zvdf6kug8bef1.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf6b37820b364715f26fbff6c646388c7c67959d)

On last quarter's earnings call, the Company guided for a considerable slowdown in revenue growth. They noted that the forecast included a negative impact of $8 billion from losing access to China. Jensen was particularly open on the call, saying,

“On export control... the platform that wins China is positioned to lead globally. Today, however, the $50 billion China market is effectively closed to U.S. industry.”

Jensen has been consistently meeting with Trump and his administration to get back into China. As recently as July 14th, NVDA provided a positive update on this disruption in a blog post, telling investors they are going to regain the ability to do so soon. Unfortunately, this will likely not affect revenue in Q2, but could lead to optimism from The Company when issuing guidance for Q3 and beyond.

Like in Q1, I will analyze each of the four main revenue segments and create a combined estimate. Since the Data Center segment is both the largest and in the spotlight, I will start there. 

# Data Center Estimate:

When issuing guidance, Colette Kress (CFO) stated the following: “Total revenue is expected to be $45 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect modest sequential growth across all of our platforms. In Data Center, we anticipate the continued ramp of Blackwell to be partially offset by a decline in China revenue.”  
  
The Blackwell ramp is expected to be completely recognized this quarter, yet the segment is set to only experience “modest growth” due to being locked out of China. The H20 sales halt hit with about three weeks left in Q1, and revenue grew 9.83% QoQ. NVDA still does not have the license required to sell in China, with less than two weeks left in Q2. A re-acceleration of growth seems unlikely this quarter, and my initial estimate is closer to 5-7% growth (\~$41 to $42 billion). 

[The Graph Shows Revenue from Data Centers Since 2024Q1 and Highlights the Deceleration in 2025Q1.](https://preview.redd.it/7n0g32oz8bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d31bb77ea496875aa86919a961199b793d099415)

The negative impact from the disruption in China will be the largest in Q2, which suggests a continued slowdown in QoQ growth. $41.5 billion would represent just over 6% growth, and with the current data and outlook, it will serve as the preliminary estimate.

# Gaming Estimate:

The rebound in gaming revenue in Q1 outpaced even the most bullish estimates. The record $3.8 billion in Q1 revenue represented a \~50% QoQ increase and was over 15% higher than the previous record. The report cites strength from the partnership with Nintendo (Switch 2) and the CFO noted, “Strong adoption by gamers, creatives, and AI enthusiasts.” The gaming beat helped NVDA’s headline revenue total in Q1, and The Company is optimistic strength will continue. However, given the cyclical nature of gaming and Q1 being such a positive surprise, it is difficult to project further QoQ growth to another record. $3.5 billion in Q2 would achieve 20% YoY growth in this segment and will serve as the preliminary estimate.

[Visualization of Strong Rebound in Gaming Revenue in 2025Q1](https://preview.redd.it/a001knqd9bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=73ce824ea06d28dd1f08ba742e551b97b7cd20ec)

# Prof. Visualization / Robotics & Auto Estimate:

In the interest of time, and given that these two segments combined for barely over $1 billion in Q1, these two segments are being bundled into one breakdown. Prof. Visualization was mentioned by the CFO on the conference call and is expected to return to QoQ growth after being flat in Q1. Robotics & Auto was down sequentially in Q1 but still up over 70% YoY. There was no mention of expectations in Q2. I currently have \~$1.15 billion for the two segments combined, and will look to fine-tune this closer to the release date.

# Total Revenue Estimate: $46.15 Billion



# Earnings Estimate:

On the Q1 report, NVDA added a Non-GAAP EPS line that specifically excluded the H20 charge. It came in at $0.96 per share, surpassing the consensus of $0.93 but falling $0.01 short of my $0.97 estimate. 

There was some initial confusion surrounding the three metrics as “regular” Non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.81, much higher than the Factset analyst consensus of $0.73. 

In Q2, NVDA will likely return to reporting the standard two EPS metrics, and yahoo finance lists the average estimate from 40 analysts at $1.00 per share. The earnings whisper number is a bit lower at $0.94, while the highest estimate from a single analyst is $1.09. 

While it is relatively easy to find consensus estimates for headline figures like EPS and Total Revenue, most analysts do not break out revenue by segment nor show how they convert top-line revenue to bottom-line profitability. This analysis shows the full process of forecasting revenue by segment and how it translates to the bottom-line in a form of unique transparency. 

The last section established the revenue estimate, but to get to EPS, estimates need to be made for gross margin, operating expenses, non-operating expenses, and total shares outstanding. 

NVDA’s company-issued guidance for both gross margin and operating expenses has been largely reliable in recent quarters. In Q2, the company expects gross margin of 72% and operating costs of $4 billion, which are used in this estimate. 

The company does not issue guidance for non-operating expenses nor shares outstanding, but accurate estimates can be obtained. 

[Stabilization of Cost Increases in 2024 with uptick in 2025Q1](https://preview.redd.it/ulf2s2nz9bef1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=38ed7a3d33b88cfaf4134645ffd638b043f67ca7)

The above graph shows historical data for non-operating expenses and QoQ growth for the segment. The growth rate has largely stabilized compared to previous years, even with an uptick in Q1. $4.0 billion would represent a decrease back to about 5% growth, while my current estimate of $4.1 billion represents an increase of just under 8%. 

Estimating shares outstanding can be tricky, as the company’s share repurchase program is inconsistent. NVDA still has about $25 billion authorized under the current plan for share repurchases, but that is down after aggressive buybacks in Q1. 

This analysis estimates about $9 billion in buybacks in Q2, reducing the shares outstanding from 24.61 to 24.55 billion (60m shares @ 150 = $9 B). The estimate is similar to the amount repurchased in Q4 and is lower than repurchases in Q1.   


[EPS Calculation Visualized, While Highlighting Opaqueness of Consensus](https://preview.redd.it/kglfaixaabef1.png?width=1924&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d95f34e8f6bf00b14d87a7d6d645d9e400bb658)

The calculation comes out to $1.02 EPS, which is slightly above the average analyst’s expectations. $46.15 billion in revenue is also only slightly above the consensus. 

This is the closest my estimates have been to the consensus, which has been surpassed each of the last 10 quarters. Given that I expect relatively muted results this quarter, guidance for the rest of the year will be in focus during the call. 

# Guidance:

After the positive update on China sales, investors are looking for strong guidance. While it’s not as straightforward as adding the lost $8 billion back into the forecast, analysts are expecting the worst to be in the past. Investors are looking for signs that the “start of the new wave” Jensen mentioned last quarter will materialize this year. 

The current expectation for Q3 revenue is \~$51.5 billion, an increase of 13% from Q2 expectations ($45.55). In Q1, revenue grew 10% QoQ to $44.06 billion. This means analysts expect just over 3% growth in the current quarter with notable re-acceleration in Q3. 

Analysts are looking for at least a piece of the Chinese market in Q3 with the $51.5 billion forecast. Q2 guidance would have been closer to $53 billion with full access to China, suggesting the Q3 forecast still projects some disruption in China near term. 

If NVDA signals a faster-than-expected ramp in sales to China, guidance expectations that already look strong could still be too low. However, any delays in the licensing process or misaligned inventory could dampen Q3’s forecast. 

# Valuation:

Regardless of belief in the company, NVDA is expensive right now. “Expensive” in this case means that it is trading at higher multiples than multi-year averages. 

Even using the H20 excluded EPS number from Q1, NVDA has earned $3.34 per share over the last four quarters. Trailing earnings are expected to increase to $3.66 after Q2’s report, while full year EPS is currently expected to come in at around $4.30. 

Based on a current price of \~$173, NVDA is currently trading at over 51x TTM earnings, and 40x forward earnings.

While NVDA has previously traded for 40x forward earnings, it has also traded for closer to 20x forward earnings as recently as this year. 

NVDA is also currently experiencing an elevated Price to Sales ratio (higher than 75% of history) of over 28x sales, and its Price to Book ratio of 50x is more expensive than 91% of NVDA’s history. 

Buying NVDA at $170 makes sense only if the company continues to deliver bullish surprises on top of already sky-high expectations. I am not selling shares ahead of the report, even with the price outpacing my targets. 

# Positions:

When I began posting NVDA analysis and creating my price targets, NVDA traded for about $140 per share. At the time, I felt the price was fair, and it wasn’t until the liberation day tariff sell-off to sub $90 that I began buying more aggressively. 

I currently own 200 shares with a cost basis around $125. While I expected NVDA to recover rather quickly, the near 100% rally from April lows leads me to believe hype and FOMO are driving the price higher rather than fundamental growth. While NVDA’s growth has been explosive, the current price leaves no room for negative catalysts. 

Based on my expectations for NVDA in the rest of 2025, I sold an ATM covered call expiring in December. I am willing to sell at $175 between now and the end of the year, so I decided to collect $3000 ($1500 x2) selling that call option. I now have $15 of downside protection through December or will sell my shares for a massive profit.

# TL;DR

**⁃    Slight consensus beat in Q2**   
**⁃    Strong guidance for 2H FY25**  
**⁃    Valuation concerns**  
**⁃    Holding 200 shares @ 125 with ATM ccs ($175) for December**  
**⁃    Most detailed breakdown of earnings from any analyst**

1mmmesw,2025-08-10,"Would you swap NVO with UNH, TTD, FTNT, OSCR, HIMS, SEZL, ABDE, UPS, SNAP?
Bought NVO at 70, at current price, am considering swapping it out with any of these tickers, because I feel the recovery will be slow because of the influence from Trump over the healthcare sector.

* UNH - down 55% this year
* TTD - down 44% this year
* FTNT - up 5% this year, but down 25% from last week
* OSCR - down 14% this year
* HIMS - up 225% this year, but down 18% from last two weeks
* SEZL - up 363% this year, but down 38% from last month
* ABDE - down 35% this year
* UPS - down 30% this year
* SNAP - down 18% this year.

Personally leaning towards FTNT/HIMS/OSCR because they seem to have higher potential.

Appreciate any insights.
Personally I’m holding NVO and adding UNH. “do DD for me” no I wouldn't. Hello no. Buy high sell low…

If anything, I am accumulating NVO right now. Sell me your shares. It looked like LLY was gonna win the PO weight loss battle until their trials had a 25% drop out rate. My money is on NOVO now. Is it because of its profitability and market cap that makes it more likely to recover in the next 1 or 2 years? Basically. I like buying cheap and unloved stocks. Healthcare and biotech have, generally speaking, done very poorly in recent years.  Of the 9 names some will over preform and/or underperform NVO.  It looks like bottom fishing.

1mmkjzr,2025-08-10,"How do we feel about precious metals?
I am very diversified including assets like gold/silver. Wondering if I should sell into this meteoric rise…gold and silver prices up basically 40% in the past year. market is getting too hot?

At the same time I understand the macro forces behind the move with tariffs and falling confidence in the USD. Do we still think there is room to run or is this going to be a peak like we saw back in 2011?


I love how people here are “buying gold at the top is not smart” but when you point out that stocks are bonkers and a lot of the fundamentals for the AI bubble are eroding, “no there is no top, line only go up”  Precious metals can feel like a rocket ride when they’re ripping 40 %, but they’re still just shiny insurance policies. Gold and silver don’t create earnings; they mostly keep up with inflation over very long stretches and zig when stocks zag.

If you’re heavily overweight on a stock or sector and it’s keeping you up at night, it’s totally reasonable to skim off a little profit and rebalance back to your target allocation. A small slice (5‑10 %) can be a nice hedge against currency/debt worries, but betting the farm on metals is just another form of market timing.

Nobody knows if this run has legs or if it’s 2011 all over again. The macro story changes every week. Stick to a plan that fits your risk tolerance, enjoy the ride, and let the rest of your diversified portfolio do the heavy lifting. If I knew that answer, I’d be much richer than I am.

That said, people are viewing multiple other markets (real estate, equities) the same way. And they’ve been viewing them that way for the past 4 or so years. So are you going to pull out of one (allegedly) overvalued market and into another?

IMO a small amount of metals are useful for diversification. But I don’t speculate on future movements. [Gold to S&P 500TR](https://inflationchart.com/gold-in-spxtr/?logarithmic=1) rating is pretty low now. More than 3 times lower than in 2011. [Silver to S&P 500TR](https://inflationchart.com/silver-in-spxtr/?logarithmic=1) is ridiculously low - close to 1999 all time low now. It is quite possible that we still have a significant room for growth. I've been using the [gold/silver strategy](https://moneymade.io/learn/articles/trading-gold-silver-ratio/) to go in and out of gold and silver over the past couple years and has worked
 
So the rise to the top has worked well >If you're heavily overweight 


Stop body shaming me Ive been hedging with some gold since the US weaponized SWIFT/CHIPS to seize Russia’s foreign reserves. I’ve bought the top in gold numerous times in those years, surprisingly those purchases are no longer remotely close to the top. Strange how things work. 

Most people on Reddit are hyper focused on the daily charts to their detriment, the posts when gold goes down $20 on gold subreddits are hilarious, all the newbs being like ‘oh shit, is it going to 0?!?!?’

The only solid investing advice I’ve learned from Reddit is to not source investing advice from Reddit. Yeah, seriously. Look at all those chumps that bought the S&P500 at all time highs in 2014. I bet they feel like suckers now. That’s how the market works. Gold and Silver are exactly the same as when it was created. The atoms don't change. The politicians and their corporate overlords don't want you to save, they want you to spend and hypothecate more and more debt slaves. The price you see for silver and gold is a paper/digital price, decided in the Fiat derivatives market. I like silver, for me, because it brings discipline to my personal finances. I stack and it's my savings account, liquid enough, so when I have an unexpected expense like a clogged EGR valve, I can sell a little silver to pay for the cost.

If anyone has any advice let me know please and thank you

VTI and VXUS give you a piece of thousands of companies across the U.S. and the rest of the world, so you're already well diversified. QQQM and the single stocks (NVDA, GOOG, etc.) lean heavily into tech and will swing around a lot; that's fine as a small 'fun' sleeve, but don't expect them to magically beat a plain index without more risk. Most people keep 80–90% in a broad market fund or two, then use the remainder for companies they follow for fun. The exact percentages matter way less than consistently adding to your accounts and having a cushion so you don't have to sell during a downturn. Keep it simple and let compounding do the hard work.

1mlui74,2025-08-09,"Google’s Decade Long Bet on Custom Chips Is the AI Wild Card Wall Street Hasn’t Priced In, Profitable Businesses Will Run on ASICs, Not GPUs, GPT-5 making it move?
The rollout of ChatGPT-5 could be less about a leap in model capability and more about a strategic infrastructure shift from NVIDIA GPU-based inference (Azure) to Google TPU-based inference. If correct, this represents a major cost structure disruption in AI serving, one that the market has not yet priced in, with direct implications for NVIDIA’s data center margins and Microsoft’s AI economics.

Google has too much risk right now with the Department of justice. Else I would say it’s an opportunity. Watch out when the market realises when ChatGPT is not running on Nvidia.

Could it just be:
GPT-5: New brain?
Nah.
Same brain, new landlord.
Bye-bye NVIDIA GPUs on Azure, hello Google TPUs.
Bye, Felicia. 👋
google doesn't sell those TPUs and are still constrained by producing them at TSMC. it probably wouldn't be a lot better if they did it at samsung. Anthropic’s Claude runs on TPUs inside Google’s data centers. I don’t see Google ever selling them market. When they can bring more workload to their own data Centre. What does it matter they don’t sell the chips if they rent them? If anything that seems more bullish for GCP Nvidia just open sourced Blackwell with FP4 production capabilities.  tl:dr  unless TPU has this capability today, it's not competitive with Nvidia's Blackwell architecture which RAISES PERFORMANCE 30X over Hopper.

[https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/delivering-1-5-m-tps-inference-on-nvidia-gb200-nvl72-nvidia-accelerates-openai-gpt-oss-models-from-cloud-to-edge](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/delivering-1-5-m-tps-inference-on-nvidia-gb200-nvl72-nvidia-accelerates-openai-gpt-oss-models-from-cloud-to-edge)

How does GPT5 change any of that?

Here is the [Nvidia slide showing the perf gain](https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1bi1rok/blackwell_inf_compared_to_hopper/#lightbox) from a year ago. And yet the entirety of Google's workloads runs on TPUs. Clearly, they are flexible enough. Everything looks like a transformer these days, anyways, and every workload is based on matrix multiplications. Which is what TPUs are designed for.
They are more scalable as well: thousands of chips in a TPU superpod, but only 72 Blackwell GPUs connected by NV link. Unfortunately you are sighting false marketing claims that have been circulating for years and for which there is no justification. Zero basis in reality. state-of-the-art inference optimizations (FlashAttention, quantization kernels, tensor parallelism frameworks) are developed for CUDA (Nvidia) first, so TPU adoption can lag, but JAX and PyTorch/XLA support has improved, the GPU ecosystem is still far more mature for inference.

There’s no need to throw the TPU away, you don’t need to get rid of them. The mathematics matrices and tensors make up a lot of what’s going on in TPU. There’s many companies that want to cost-effective way to run their models. TPUs and other ASICs are not as adaptable and flexible or scale as well was GPUs.

I don't see they making much more than 15% of total compute. No, what I'm saying is the right tool for the right job.

You seem to be under some notion that GPUs are ""less than"" or inferior in some way to a purpose built part like an asic.  Bitcoin mining is simple, there is one algorithm, it just get harder and harder to unlock more value as time goes on.  It was a perfect case for an ASIC and an obvious and economic reason why ASICs replaced GPUs for BTC mining in 2012 or whenever.   However you will notice in ETH mining there was never an ASIC developed, that algorithm was suited to GPUs which were widely spread before they went to a proof of stake model.

AI models are nothing like BTC.

Why GPUs are the processor of choice for AI is because they are programmable or flexible.  AI models get tweeked and new attempts at problem solving are commonplace.   ASICs by their nature are necessarily limited in what they can do, and this is why they've had a hard time gaining traction.  An asic might take two years to develop and come to market, but the industry is too dynamic.  By the time that product is ready to deploy, it's obsolete.  (The notable exception is Google who can continue to throw internally developed workloads at it.)

Maybe ASICs have a place in the future, but if you look at TPUs to GPUs at any given point in time (and it's VERY difficult to do because of the closed environment around TPUs) TPUs are less capable (run fewer models) and generally less performant than the GPU of the same process architecture by the time they're displaced by their next gen brethren.  Google even quit (or has severely pulled back) submitting TPU to the MLPerf benchmark organization.

Idk what I was thinking when my CD was up in April and I renewed it. I guess I wanted the market to fall even lower because I had missed out on it, now it is at an all-time high. I am playing the long game, BUT I will be REALLY mad if I throw like 650 in there, and then poof, 30% correction... costing myself a LOT of money long-term based on bad timing. I hate that I missed that discount, and figure if I wait eventually it will drop again. I realize it may not and you can't ""time the market"", but surely VTI or whatever will fall well below 300 again in the not too distant future.... Makes me sick missing out on six figures for no reason! And I don't know what percentage to put in which. All in VTI/ Some SPY? Some VOO? Idk.
Then wait till it gets even higher > understands you can't time the market

> tries to time the market

tale as old as time Google the S&P 500 and zoom out to 2007. We've been at all time highs for about 15 years now. The stock market reaches all-time highs fairly often, occurring on roughly 31% of months since 1926 or about a quarter of the time since 1950, with the S&P 500 hitting new records on about 7% of trading days.

Ai slop answer.  Don’t try to outsmart yourself here.  Yes it could go down.  But it could also go on a 20% tear and then even a correction will be above the previous ATH. The stock market is within 5% of ATHs 40%> of the time. Act accordingly. Exactly. Its more likely that it'll go up. SPY @ 630: Why didn't I buy at 530?


SPY @ 490: I ain't touching that shit


SPY @ 640: Why didn't I buy in at 500? So, when the market crashed 20% in April, you were scared, constantly thinking, *“What if it drops another 20%?”* And I can guarantee you’ll feel the same fear if it happens again. Exactly!

1ml5ycm,2025-08-08,"A response to ""lower interest rates, why?""
Another redditor posted [this question](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ml11ly/lower_interest_rates_why/) and I got carried away with my answer.  
It does not fit the comment space, and I thought it may be interesting for a larger audience than the comments from the post. Please note that I do not have any political affiliation, I am not even american, and I am only providing a semi-educated commentary about the FED's job.  
\------------------------------------------------------------------  
The FED has two mandates: maximum employment and low inflation (nowadays officially 2% [FED dual mandate](https://www.chicagofed.org/research/dual-mandate/dual-mandate)).

One very simplistic way of thinking about the FED is the Taylor rule ([Taylor Rule wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_rule)): essentially, if the FED sees employment and inflation raising, it should raise rates in order to *cool* the economy. Vice versa, if employment and inflation are going down, it should lower rates in order to *heat* the economy.

This is econ 101. 

What is interesting is that, normally, the economy is mostly hit by demand shocks. We think about demand shocks as changes in the demand for goods, which, for a constant supply, increases inflation (prices are a point where demand and supply meet) and increases employment/lowers unemployment (to make more goods firms hire more labour).

Keeping rates systematically below a given point (what we call r\*), makes it so that when a demand shock hits: prices go up, unemployment goes down, labour is squeezed, so wages need to increase, which means prices go up and on and on. Effectively, this is what happened in the US - and globally - in the 70s ([the anatomy of double digit inflation](https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c11462/c11462.pdf)).

Therefore, economists tend to think about the economy as a series of equilibrium: there is an equilibrium interest rate (r\*), an equilibrium unemployment rate (NAIRU or u\*), and many other fundamentals, which we call **stars**. There **stars** tend to move for several reasons. For example, an economy in which people have high rate of unionization may have a higher NAIRU than an economy with low unionization rates. Therefore, not all economies are the same, and not all stars are the same. Here is an example from a paper I like a lot, which tracks r\* in all major economies: [global trends in interest rates](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25039).

This is also econ 101.

There are (in my opinion) three sides of what has been going on in the US in the last 8 months.  
  
First, inflation is on an overall downward trend, but still far from the rate of 2% ([FED inflation](https://www.federalreserve.gov/economy-at-a-glance-inflation-pce.htm)). Normally, we would look at this as a trivia problem: inflation is higher than target, let's keep rates high. However, because the data we get tends to be late, we may also try to extrapolate its trend.

For example, the European Central Bank, which is basically the FED but for the majority of countries from the EU, lowered rates even when inflation was above 2%, and still managed to get it to target. You can see EA inflation [here](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/macroeconomic_and_sectoral/hicp/html/index.en.html) and rates [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ECBDFR). This is because they saw it was on an overall downard trend, assumed that real inflation was going to go down anyway, and took a more aggressive stance. 

In October, t[he FED did the same](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFF). The rates were higher than now, and had been lowered as the FED was afraid that inflation would have othewise quickly gone below 2%.

Second, his is where tariffs come into play. The Fed tracks inflation expectations from the SPF ([survey of professional forecasters](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/real-time-data-research/inflation-forecasts)). The professional forecasters are not extremely good at predicting what is going to happen, but they do capture the business sentiment fairly well. Looking at the median of the surveys, you may see that after Trump's election, inflation expectations start to rise again because of tariffs.

That is because tariffs are really tricky. They are not a *demand* shock like the one we talked about before. They are a *supply* (specifically *technology/productivity)* shock. Technology shocks are a type of shock that depresses the labour market while being inflationary. For example, a new cost saving tech is introduced to the market: this makes it so that products are cheaper, so people can buy more of them, and the labour market is doing good, but inflation is below its optimal value. Dealing with supply shocks is a nightmare for economists at the FED.

The problem with technology shocks is that the two sides of the Taylor rule - inflation and employment - are not going to the same direction. Currently, if you look at inflation (or in this case inflation expectations), by all means you are supposed to *increase* rates. Inflation is raising (2.2 in April vs 2.6 in June). Inflation expectations are also rising.

Third, employment. Until recently, our impression was that the labour market was doing good. If you look at the FED announcement, they cited lower demand for labour (which we track from [vacancies](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LMJVTTUVUSM647S)) and a lower labour supply (because of the new immigration policies), but overall growing [employment](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS) and a very low unemployment rate (you can put [unemployment](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE) and [NAIRU](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NROU) in a single chart and see that unemployment is below the NAIRU).

However, **the job revisions are signalling a recession incoming**.

\-----------------------            --------------  
Effectively, the FED has been served a hot potato.  On one side, you have a labour market which is ***not strong*** by any metric, which means you are supposed to **lower** the rates to support the economy.

On the other side, inflation will probably raise even more now that the tariffs are starting to effectively come in. Imagine a paradox in which all you buy is 100% imported. On average, inflation would be 15% compared to the previous month, and more compared to the previous year. While this is not the case, in a scenario in which inflation is already rising, adding tariffs on top is not a good idea.

So why do [analysts think the FED is going to cut rates in September ](https://www.reuters.com/business/jpmorgan-brings-forward-fed-rate-cut-forecast-september-2025-08-08/)?

It is because a recession is probably undergoing, and it is getting worse and worse by the day. On one side, this means that the little element that gets multiplied in the Taylor rule coefficient for the labour market gets higher. On the other side, randomly raising prices means overall lower economic activity. Basically, because during a recession people are buying less goods, the prices go down because there is a declining demand.

Remember the demand shock from before? Right now, the US economy is undergoing a large negative supply shock, and a semi-large negative demand shock. Both of them have negative effects on the labour market and overall economic activity. But they have contrasting effects on inflation. Realistically, the technology - tariff - shock will prevail on the demand - lower econ activity - in increasing inflation.

So, let's answer the question. Should the FED cut rates? I do not know. **But I know they will**. However, inflation will probably go back to the large levels we have seen during the pandemic.

\----------------------------------  
Finally, one bonus question:

Is Trump right when he says JPOW should have cut rates before? Basically, **no**.

The reason is very simple. Had JPOW cut rates before, inflation would have raised to over the current 2.6%, and the labour market would have been in slightly a better shape. However, the likelihood of managing inflation would have gone virtually to zero. 

EDIT: Fixed typos and formatting.
Stagflation is a dangerous game. You're on point here and I can't help but wonder what you think about the treasury bond market in relation to all this.

We know that according to Trump the bond markets got ""yippy"" when his first tariff chart started to crash the stock market. This surely forced him to delay them. We're allegedly ""back"" to there with tariffs, yet we're near all-time highs in the market. What will he do when the yield gets too high again? Yeah, I am also fairly surprised by what is going on with the market and tariffs, simply because the reaction to the first tariff announcement implied something like a -10% on the market if I remember correctly.

Today, we should be at about 9% from January. A lot of that gain happened after the EU trade announcement.  
  
One explaination I can come up with is that there was a reduction in uncertainty. The biggest non-american trading partners (EU, JPN, SK,UK) had a set tariff of about 15% and Canada and Mexico are apparently managing to trade easily thanks to NAFTA (although I haven't looked that much into it). I think it may have been a sign that that was the moment the market thought there were finally sufficiently good business conditions to start investing again. 

Another thing to keep in mind is that the 9% gain goes basically out the window if you consider exchange rates.   
100 USD in the SP500 in January meant 97 EUR.   
109 USD in the SP500 today mean 93 EUR. 

This may still be too large an evaluation for the current situation.

Trump basically said he likes having a weak dollar (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veo6ksI5H8c) arguing it improves exports. Apparently, Trump's new appointee to the FED is the architect around dollar's devaluation (https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-administration-mar-a-lago-plan-to-weaken-dollar-is-deeply-flawed-by-kenneth-rogoff-2025-05).

This takes effectively an anti-consumer position, because it lowers internal competition; and a pro-manufacturer position, because it lowers competition. But manufacturing in the US is deeply integrated with global supply chains, so the short term effect on manufacturing in the US is also negative (one proxy would be employment in manufacturing https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MANEMP)  
  
I kinda think he got the idea of the US being a manufacturing superpower from seeing China and how his advisors were scared of the power Chinese manufacturing had on US supply chains (from chips and such). That, combined with his 70s view of the economy as ""making things"", is fundamentally incompatible with the current economy. Let me ask a question I've been thinking about since we got the bad jobs data. If the Fed lowers the rate, would it actually increase jobs? We have been seeing an outsized portion of Capex spending by tech companies in AI with the explicit purpose of reducing the number of jobs they require. If granted access to cheaper borrowing rates, it wouldn't be crazy to imagine that it is mostly spent on efforts to reduce jobs instead of growing them.

That's just one sector, but every sector is at least actively considering replacing jobs with AI anywhere they can and at the earliest opportunity to do so. The dollar is either the world currency or is progressively devalued, but it cannot be both. Floating exchange rates to not foster investment. An international investor that wants to invest on NVIDIA has no way of protecting itself from randomly set exchange rates. That is part of the reason why, even though growth prospect for the EU are not great, investment has started flowing there. It is a large open market, which is the closest thing to the US. 

That is just a bad capital allocation for the global economy. Investors would like to invest on the US service sector, but they are facing additional risks. Moreover, they may get randomly taxed for some reason [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/16/donald-trump-revenge-tax-could-threaten-foreign-investment-into-us-analysts-say](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/16/donald-trump-revenge-tax-could-threaten-foreign-investment-into-us-analysts-say) 

""What will he do when the yield gets too high again?"" I think we need to wait and see. For now (september to next year), there is a world in which the FED lowers rates, the market does not buy enough treasury to keep the yields low, and the FED does lots of OMO. 

In a very distant future in which inflation gallops, and economic activity is not too bad, and interest rates need to be raised, we will see how truly independent the FED may be. But by then who knows how many, even within the FED, will want it to still be independent. After all, the new Trump appointee says "" pure independence is incompatible with a democratic system."" [https://media4.manhattan-institute.org/wp-content/uploads/reform-the-federal-reserves-governance-to-deliver-better-monetary-outcomes.pdf](https://media4.manhattan-institute.org/wp-content/uploads/reform-the-federal-reserves-governance-to-deliver-better-monetary-outcomes.pdf) > it's a matter of upgrading your iPhone every 4 years instead of 2 and your typical person owns 27 pairs of sneakers and don't need 28-35.

So we're just making up imaginary people now and claiming they're representative of the average american? Shhhh, OP is vry smrt I had a feeling you'd have something to say, and I appreciate your answers. 

I hadn't really thought about the government weakening the dollar on purpose. It is sort of a cheat code to make things look good on paper aside from the stated intent.

I've heard a bit of noise about efforts by the E.U. and U.K. to incentivize more investment into their own markets. With your Nvidia example I wonder if we're doing that for them. The Fed is short for ""Federal Reserve"", not an acronym, and doesn't need to be set in all-caps. Initialisms which may be appropriate depending on the context include ""FRS"" for ""Federal Reserve System"" or ""FOMC"" for ""Federal Open Market Committee"".

1ml1elh,2025-08-08,"Fortinet Stock Analysis (-25% Price Drop)

I recently did a deep dive on Fortinet, and here are my takeaways.

The stock recently got leveled after their revenue growth from a hardware refresh cycle underwhelmed wall street. The team gives very modest and reslistic guidance and doesn't celebrate their performance and instead gives a formulaic roadmap of their trajectory, product/service rollouts and mid term goals. 

Fortinet competes most directly with Palo Alto Networks but positions itself as a more budget-friendly option. For small and mid-sized businesses, Fortinet is often a primary cybersecurity solution (even though the market is fragmented and most companies have to use more than one cyber security companies services). In larger enterprises, it is more commonly used as a cost-effective firewall or SASE option for regional or secondary facilities, while the core network and main data centers are usually protected by Palo Alto Networks, Zscaler or Netskope. 

Fortinet is well-regarded for delivering high-quality firewalls that are both energy and cost efficient compared to competitors. This focus on performance per dollar has helped them build a massive customer base of around 700,000+, far ahead of Palo Alto’s roughly 90,000 customers. The trade-off is a much lower average revenue per customer. That large installed base is where their moat really sits today.

The growth opportunity for Fortinet is in upselling its existing SMB-heavy base into cloud-native SASE services and gradually shifting the business model toward higher-margin subscription revenue. Right now, the company still makes most of its money from hardware sales with cross-selling and upgrade cycles layered in. They most recently announced their upcoming move to SASE and view them self as a contender for the #1 position when it comes to SASE market share. 

In hardware firewalls, Fortinet holds about 50 percent of the global market by unit volume, making it the clear leader. By revenue share, Palo Alto leads, reflecting its higher prices and focus on large enterprises. Fortinet’s lower-cost positioning also gives them room to raise prices over time if they choose. Management has a track record of prioritizing customer satisfaction, often focusing on designing more energy and cost-efficient products to meet the needs of their customer base

It’s true that Fortinet was slower than peers to embrace cloud-native security, but it may not be too late. Many of their SMB customers have not fully moved to the cloud, and for a lot of them, switching to a different security ecosystem would be costly and disruptive. That inertia gives Fortinet some breathing room to catch up. They will probably not be able to convert enterprise companies to use FTNT in their core data centers. But once again, they work great as a secondary solution.

What do you all think? Am I missing anything here? 
My company uses them and their ""Don't ask me again on this device"" button has never worked once, making me hate thinking about them. I'm in. Fortinet has no SMB program, they lost in a super cycle for HW Refresh, as we are in 4 years after covid.

Fortinet is top level in CVE vulnerabilities, the last 18 months, that’s an absolute no go and shows some deep product issues and will decrease margins.

Fortinet has no 50% of the market it’s some 10% 3-4 place.

Moving to the Cloud isn’t for Fortinet, they are a Data Center FW company.

You don’t seem to understand the sector. I think companies periodically over time have collectively made that button useless. My remember this account, don't ask me again buttons just do nothing nowadays. Good call here. I hold a small position in Fortinet for now but the other players reporting will certainly add some more clarity to the matter. I think you wait until after Palo Alto reports on 8/18. If they hit and guide up it’s a specific Fortinet issue. If not it’s an industry issue and might not be a bad play. But my money is on PANW hitting. SMB stands for Small to Medium sized Business which is what makes up most of Fortinets customer base. 

Quick google search shows Fortinet is not even in the top 5 of cyber security companies with the most CVE vulnerabilities. 

They have a 50% market share of existing firewalls by product sales volume . Not by revenue. They have high sales volume, but at a cheaper price than their competitors. 

Fortinet is expanding its SASE (secure access service edge) offering by integrating its security and networking capabilities into a unified cloud-delivered platform. Their biggest growth driver going forward.   

A simple google search would have saved you time typing this up. But I'm happy to help clear up your confusion. As a former Palo Alto employee, I really hope you buy more Fortinet. hmm.. are you saying that fortinet revenue is also dependent on how well its products integrate with apps from its bigger peers? hmm.. are you saying that fortinet revenue is also dependent on how well its products integrate with apps from its bigger peers?

1mkuq5z,2025-08-08,"Move a large amount of money into the stock market now, or wait until fall in case of a market correction?
In my rollover IRA, I have about 50k in a Schwab Prime Advantage Money Fund (SWVXX). (I put the money in there last month after transferring it from a previous 403b.) I wonder if I should start putting that money into ETFs (VOO, VTI) or individual stocks (BRK/B, MSFT, AAPL) to get more growth, but I also wonder whether I should wait for fall to do so, as many are anticipating a market correction due to the lack of job growth, interest rates being cut, etc. 

Another wrinkle is that I **may** move to Europe within the next year (though it's still quite unclear), and if I do so I will have to switch from ETFs to individual stocks due to taxes in my target country (essentially, they'll tax the shit out of foreign ETF gains whereas the taxes on foreign-held individual stocks are at the normal rate). 

Any advice, input, thoughts would be welcome! 
most people fail trying to time the market like this No one knows what the market will do. Anyone who tells you what it will do with any confidence is full of shit. 

You have three options:
* Invest it all now (this is historically optimal)
* Invest a bit at a time over the next N months or years (called dollar cost averaging). This is not optimal but protects your downside. 
* Wait until a market crash. You might get lucky but usually you end up watching the market go up. 

On average the market goes up (otherwise why would you invest in it.) 

(Not financial advice and I don't know shit.) Market will go up +20% from here and then “crash” -5% and OP will feel like a genius when he buys. Time in the market is almost always better/easier than timing the market WHEN - not IF - there is a correction, it may be so much farther up from here that it never gets this cheap again. You may be waiting forever. That money was already invested ?

I am not sure why if you have a 401k that is fully invested in the market and then do a roll over , why do you think it should be DCA back in ? It was already invested into the market right?

The roll over shouldn't affect anything? If you did not do the roll over you wouldn't randomly go 100% cash just to DCA would you?

A roll over changes nothing . what if the drop takes 10years and doesnt even come back to the levels where we are rn?  
then what? You have a possibility of a near term expense with your move & you are getting a 4% yield in your current investment. I would at minimum wait until after you decide if you are moving to Europe and/or complete the move. This really depends on how active you are and your risk tolerance.   If both are low, ETF/Mutual Fund S&P500 and forget about it.  Individual stocks will require a little more research and can be way more volatile than most would like it.   It just really depends like I said. Honestly, timing the market is a gamble — even the pros mess it up. If you’re nervous about dumping the whole $50k in now, DCA it over a few months so you catch dips if they happen.

Your possible Europe move is huge here — if ETFs get taxed hard there, you might just start building positions in the individual stocks you’d hold long-term (BRK/B, MSFT, AAPL) so you don’t have to sell later.

SWVXX is at least giving you some yield while you decide, so no rush-panic needed 👍.

1mkteh6,2025-08-08,"Long Term Capital Gains Tax Minimization Strategy
Wanted to get your feedback on a tax strategy based on this hypothetical situation to minimize my taxes and avoid wash sale rules (other rule I'm not considering?), while also getting similar market exposure:

Sell Lot 1: $SPY +$100,000 gain (holding for 1+ year)  
Sell Lot 2: $SPY -$51,650 loss (holding for 1+ year)

Net Long Term Gain: $48,350

Buy: $48,350 $VOO, a similar position but buying a different ETF would not trigger wash sale rules

This would save me about $7,252.50 in federal taxes for the year. Is doing the above every year an effective way to reduce my taxes over the long term? Is there an ordinary income (assume I make $200,000 from my normal job) or other piece I'm missing?

Based on the long term capital gains tax (federal) IRS rules below (let's ignore state tax details for now)

|**Tax rate**|Single|
|:-|:-|
|0%|$0 to $48,350|
|15%|$48,351 to $533,400|

Source: [https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/capital-gains-tax-rates](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/capital-gains-tax-rates)

  

Capital gains rates are based on your total income, not just your cap gains sales. 

Your $200k salary will have you in the 15% bracket. Short-term gains are taxed *as* ordinary income, i.e. the additional $$ is taxed at that marginal rate.

Long-term gains are taxed at 0, 15, or 20% based on your total income. You would be in the 15% bracket. >Buy: $48,350 $VOO, a similar position but buying a different ETF would not trigger wash sale rules

If the IRS challenged this, they could easily argue SPY and VOO are substantially identical and disallow the loss. 

Ordinary income does factor in, so you wouldn't be in the 0% bracket. there is no statute of limitations on tax fraud. The IRS could be refunded in 8 years and with AI these things will become much easier to spot. 

Also, while it's unlikely this in itself will trigger something, there are always random audits and if OP is audited for something else, it would be easy for an agent to spot this violation. Tax advisor here, you’ll be taxed at 15% of the net gain, so $7200 is your consequence of the $48k net.  Purchasing a new but similar ETF will not trigger wash loss sales because it’s not the same identifier. 

On your 1099-B, they’ll actually consolidate those LT gains/losses onto one line at the end and you can use that single line entry in lieu of listing out each individual sale. You’d have to make literally $0 in wages for you to see a lower LT capital gains rate.  

You plan for 15%, hope that deductions and credits whittle that down at filing. Wash sale is only applicable for claiming losses. You're selling for a net gain. Your losses from selling lot 2 just offset some of the gains from selling lot 1.

You can only get into the wash sale scenario if you only sell the specific shares from lot 2 for the loss. But keep in mind you can only offset $3k of ordinary income per year with capital losses but you can carry over losses in excess of $3K to subsequent years (up to $3K per year) indefinitely I believe. Technically yes, you could save money putting 48 k of LCTG per year, but I think it’s on the first 48000 so you’d need no other income ( I hope I’m wrong !) Several problems here any money you make from the sale of stock is added to any other inomce you have and your tax bill will be determined by that total ammount.  You cannot calculate your tax until you add in your other inocme.  Which would push you into the next higher tax bracket. 

A wash sale occurs when you sell stock at a loss.   Meaning no captial gains.  So the capital gains you show would not occur instead you have zero or negative income from the sale. I would probably just use VTI instead of VOO. Could swap back to VOO after the wash period expires if desired.

1mkk31x,2025-08-08,"50k savings, unsure how much to risk and need help understanding
I have 50k saved into a HYSA and I thought that was the smart thing to do with no risk involved but I've recently got curious about stocks and have been looking at things like VOO, SPY, RSP. I'm wondering what the right plan is for me and how much I should be investing and how do I know the right time to withdrawal.

I'm currently making 4K a month after taxes and my rent is 1.2k with utilities included. I dont want to put all my savings into stocks especially early on when I'm unsure of how it works and the risks involved. I was thinking of putting part of my future paychecks into my fidelity account I just want to know which stocks to pick and how much I should be dedicating to stocks.
QQQM is more risk, but not is not compensated risk, and there is literally no reason for a risk adverse person like OP to consider it. How old are you? Put together a total for all your monthly expenses and give yourself a 6-8 month emergency fund to sit in a HYSA. 

Start with 10-20k to invest in since you're new to investing and put most of it in VOO or any SP500 index fund. You should consider this specific investment as a long term investment. Look into ETFs or mutual funds like SWPPX if you don't want to touch individual stocks.

You should consider opening a Roth IRA as well for tax free investing towards your retirement. How about a nice 3-fund portfolio?  US stocks, international stocks, and bonds?  If you are risk adverse, and want less volatility from stocks, use a higher bond position.

Something like 40% VTI, 30% VXUS, and 30% BND.

>I just want to know which stocks to pick

Don't pick stocks.  Most stock pickers underperform the market.  Just buy the entire market with index funds.  Visit r/bogleheads and learn more.  Read a couple books. Personally put every dime in voo/google. I keep like 3k in my checking account. If I ever need more money I usually know it's coming and will either save up or withdraw from brokerage.

In the voo you'll basically double money every 10 years and in the long term I would not worry Chubb insurance - siriusxm - SPY if you don’t want to learn and just want to be consistent and save. Not financial advice. 
But you could move it into SGOV. That’s what I did. 
It earns like 4.25% APY and it pays monthly and you just reinvest it. Or you could just put like 20k in SGOV and 30k into VOO. 
If you want a lil more risk you can do QQQM and VOO. QQQ is just 50% more tech exposure. 
Make sure you have an emergency fund first. How long does it take to get any significant growth from these, is it something like 5 years or 10+ years and when would it be a good time to withdrawal What about VOO?

1mkeiwp,2025-08-07,"""Down 42% in Four Months - Tech Heavy Portfolio Getting Crushed""
I'm posting this partly for accountability and partly hoping someone can relate. My portfolio has gone from $85k to $49k over the past four months, with the worst damage happening in the last two weeks where I lost $18k.

My strategy seemed solid on paper: heavy allocation to established tech giants that I thought were ""too big to fail."" Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon, companies with massive cash flows and dominant market positions. I figured even if growth slowed, these would be relatively stable compared to speculative plays.

Boy, was I wrong.

The combination of rising interest rates, AI bubble concerns, and regulatory pressure has absolutely hammered my holdings. What I thought was a conservative approach to growth investing turned into a masterclass in concentration risk.

Here's what's eating at me: roughly $6k of this loss is my actual contributions, while $30k represents gains from earlier this year that have completely evaporated. I went from feeling like a genius in Q1 to questioning everything I thought I knew about investing.

My current dilemma: Do I start rotating into value stocks or defensive sectors? Do I double down on my thesis that these companies will recover? Or do I take the L and move to index funds like I probably should have done from the start?

The hardest part is watching my timeline for financial goals get pushed back by years. I had plans that depended on this portfolio growth, and now I'm basically back to square one.

Anyone else getting demolished by their ""safe"" large cap positions? How are you adjusting your strategy, or are you just riding it out?
How is that even possible? Were you jumping from one to the other and caught each drop? I’m also very tech heavy and wildly up this quarter Bud, all of those stocks are wildly in the green over the past 3 months. What in the world are you talking about. How have you managed this? They’re all up big time over the time frame you’re talking about. Stop fucking with your portfolio Op must have full ported into Intel as their ""tech"" allocation How have you achieved a 42% drop on those stocks? You're purposefully leaving out information here. Hast to be a completely fake post.  This level of failure is almost impossible in this market. No, we can’t relate. You had to be fucking with options or timing the exact bottom to sell and top to buy to be down this much. Then you know the reason, had you kept your money in you would be up. The mistake wasn’t the allocation at all as your post suggests, it was the fact you didn’t stick with it. You are genuinely just stupid to be down 42% in the past couple months if you were invested in tech giants That kind of emotional response is a clear sign that you have too much risk in your portfolio for your risk tolerance.

1mk5l2q,2025-08-07,"I don’t Understand How to get Dividends
(26F) I opened a traditional IRA on the App Public. I only got dividends once. I’ve never invested before but I thought I’d start. 

I’ve contributed $314 and my portfolio value is at $404

Here’s what I’ve invested in (in no particular order) : 
	1.Apple (AAPL) 2.Palantir Technologies (PLTR) 3.NVIDIA (NVDA) 4.Amazon (AMZN) 5.Alphabet (GOOGL) 6.Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) 7.Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF (SCHG) 8.Tesla (TSLA) 9.Microsoft (MSFT) 10.Meta (META) 11.JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM) 12.Rigetti Computing (RGTI) 13.Chime Financial Inc (CHYM)

Some pay dividends monthly, others quarterly.  Look up the stocks you own to find out how or if they pay.  Not all stocks pay dividends. Wrong. At least Alphabet and Meta both do dividends. We're cooked with people citing AI as factual :( 1. Like the other poster mentioned, some stocks don’t pay dividends (typically growth stocks). Some do (typically value stocks).

2. Stocks pay dividends on a regular schedule, usually either monthly or quarterly or yearly. There are also special one-off dividends sometimes, although these have fallen out of favor in favor of stock buybacks (since investors don’t get taxed by that).

3. Companies will announce a dividend as well as a date you must be invested in by in order to receive the dividend.  It looks like those pay quarterly dividends. I dont know about CHYM, and rigetti prob doesn't (?) ( im too oazy to look up the ones I don’t know ) but all the others are quarterly. How old us your account? If less than two quarters, that’s probably why. : )  Ohhh that’s helpful. I opened it in April, so it’s going on two quarters right? It’s with schwab and s&p 500 right? That’s the only overlap I’m aware of. Then again I know very little about this stuff. And I was concerned with dividends because that’s all investors rave about He didn’t say it was a fact- just citing his source! Thank you for commenting tho, this all helps me How? You have to invest in dividend paying stocks. You have to be holding that stock on the record date. Then your brokerage will deposit the money received from the company on the payment date into your account. Typically, you can elect to have those dividends re-invested right back into the same stock that they came from, or you can use those funds for other purposes.

A distribution (rather than dividend) is the word used to describe payments from a fund. The fund received dividends from a company and then the fund pays distributions to the share holders of the fund. That distribution might also include moneys from capital gains. Dividends are pretty irrelevant. I wouldn't worry about them as much as I worry about the overlap in your portfolio. Most companies, if they pass dividends are on a quarterly cadence.  Most of the mega techs listed above pays a very little dividends if at all because they put it back in their business.

1mjxe6e,2025-08-07,"MSCI world, hedge vs unhedged
I'm a British investor, and I'm growing concerned about the prospect of the dollar weakening, which seems such a big point in Trump's agenda. 

Like many people, I'm putting my money in MSCI World, which is heavy on US companies. And it seems likely that while my investment next year may grow at 8%, this profit would be cancelled if the dollar weakens 8% against the pound.

I've seen that there are hedged funds that cancel out the effect of currency, like ishares Msci world EUR hedged. Is this the safe alternative to go for? 
It is assumed that currency exchange rate effects are zero in the long term, meaning currencies are mean-reverting.


Hedging costs money so the if the above assumption is correct, long term unhedged should outperform long hedged.


Dollar mean reverted after the surge in 2022. If you look in the last 5 years, the dollar is still up a bit meaning a unhedged portfolio outperformed. Personally I’m not but you don’t have to be 100% in, you could do just some funds for a world tracker (hedge your hedge?).  Or you could look for a world fund (Excluding US) for 40% and add a 60% a hedged US only fund?

You wouldn’t be down 8% because a world fund would still only be 60% in $, so it’s about 4.8%.  What about the other 40% of your fund, what will their currency be doing vs the £.

How much are the extra fees?  An extra 0.35% a year?  You are losing that from your growth each year, there is a reason we look for cheaper fees.  

If you are buying small amounts monthly (as most do from salaries), rather than a lump sum you will gradually be buying more American stocks for less if the £ has more buying power.  So the question is do you think over the time you are investing the $ will remain low, go lower or bounce back?

Equities are volatile so the currency fluctuations seem like noise to me.  If you were looking at US bonds with a set rate I’d consider it more, as you are looking for more stability and they are supposed to be a hedge against equity volatility. Currency hedging is pretty cheap at this point. And while unhedged should outperform slightly over the very long term due to the fees, one can outperform the other for very extended periods (as demonstrated by the past 15 years or so). 

I've moved to a 70/30 split unhedged/hedged for my international exposure. This will help smooth the ride and offers diversification benefits. I addition, we spend in our local currency. Not hedging is making an explicit bet that your local currency won't very stronger relative to foreign currencies. I don't think we should take that as a complete given, and at least partial hedging seems like a smart bet. Hedging costs can be thought of as an insurance premium in this case. And again, it's pretty cheap insurance.",1,0.56,3,0,JollyMolly817,investing,['UNH'],msci world hedge vs unhedged im british investor im growing concerned prospect dollar weakening seems big point trumps agenda like many people im putting money msci world heavy us companies seems likely investment next year may grow 8 profit would cancelled dollar weakens 8 pound ive seen hedged funds cancel effect currency like ishares msci world eur hedged safe alternative go assumed currency exchange rate effects zero long term meaning currencies meanreverting hedging costs money assumption correct long term unhedged outperform long hedged dollar mean reverted surge 2022 look last 5 years dollar still bit meaning unhedged portfolio outperformed personally im dont 100 could funds world tracker hedge hedge could look world fund excluding us 40 add 60 hedged us fund wouldnt 8 world fund would still 60 48 40 fund currency vs much extra fees extra 035 year losing growth year reason look cheaper fees buying small amounts monthly salaries rather lump sum gradually buying american stocks less buying power question think time investing remain low go lower bounce back equities volatile currency fluctuations seem like noise looking us bonds set rate id consider looking stability supposed hedge equity volatility currency hedging pretty cheap point unhedged outperform slightly long term due fees one outperform extended periods demonstrated past 15 years ive moved 7030 split unhedgedhedged international exposure help smooth ride offers diversification benefits addition spend local currency hedging making explicit bet local currency wont stronger relative foreign currencies dont think take complete given least partial hedging seems like smart bet hedging costs thought insurance premium case pretty cheap insurance
1mjh9ct,2025-08-06,"Did I pick a good investment?
I have $104,500 in SPY, I can handle 50% drops, and I can wait years. I want a safe investment that can't go bankrupt.

Gold just doesn't have the gains I'm looking for, and it can be just as volatile on the downside as SPY. These are set and forget investments. I do not have time to keep track of what is happening or trade.
VOO would probably be better than SPY, lower fees The numbers don't lie.  [https://i.imgur.com/UXk7pkL.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/UXk7pkL.jpg) Your choice to invest in SPY is the right one.  
You can tolerate a 50% drop, you're willing to hold for several years   and you don’t plan to actively manage the investment   that makes SPY a perfect fit  
Compared to gold, SPY offers higher long term returns and its drawdowns tend to recover more reliably  
As long as you hold steady and avoid panic selling  this is a completely reasonable and safe choice 15% bitcoin is … a bold choice.

5% at most - at most. I mean, like \~22.5% into gold is probably not everyone's cup of tea, I don't blame them, I didn't think it was worth it for a long time until I read [The A B C of Money](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/25102198.pdf) by Andrew Carnegie, when I then decided to get my allocation closer to that as conclusion I came to as a consequence of it's size (it has to be 7x bigger than AAPL for a good reason, probably, and probably deserves an allocation in kind, unless it really is just an irrational overpriced torpedo).

It is overall a poor investment, but, it is probably better than some random stock someone might pick, it is uncorrelated which is a plus, and it is a sort of beta generating asset just the same for precious metals as The S&P500 is for equities, and Bitcoin is for crypto.  You'll probably get enough alpha from the Bitcoin alone and the S&P500, does the rest really matter that much?  I'm fairly confident if you just buy those 3 things, in really any amount, you'll probably do okay, it just makes sense to do it by market cap to me for simplicities sake (as the S&P500 is already somewhat set up that way).

I mean, things could change, interest rates very well could just keep going up and we're all doomed anyways and everything get's crushed, that's what the Floating Rate Notes are for.

It could be dumb, it could be an overallocation, it could be overpriced, but I really do think in general people are woefully underallocated to it, so maybe saying having such a large allocation will make someone think to at least consider *some*. If SCHG goes to zero, the entire US and probably the global economy would be in serious trouble, which is highly unlikely. But if BTC goes to zero, life goes on like nothing happened. ETF. Use GLD or IAU.

Physical gold costs to much to buy and sell. People say they can handle 50% drops….until it actually happens. During liberation day, the so called ‘long term investor’ suddenly became the crying ‘short term trader’ 

Anyway I’ll stop shit posting. Yes, SPY is good. Robinhood? At this time, I somehow think SCHD is better. VOO is already flying at 50000 ft high, maybe I am just not daring enough, but I really wonder how much higher can it go? That's why BRK keeps all those cash, but for us small time investors, I have no idea what we can do if we sit on our cash. It's surely a dilemma. Lastly, you can take the risk and you have time, but I worry if the next major crash can recover quickly as the past ones in the last couple decades. Who knows?

1mjc4x3,2025-08-06,"AMD (AMD) $162, 5% lower after a decent beat and guidance.
08/05/2025

AMD (AMD) $162, 5% lower after a decent beat and guidance and upgrades from analysts.

**Looks like a classic sell on news after a meteoric 100% rise this year.**

**Overall, I had trimmed 30% of my position on Friday, and don’t plan to buy that back. Planning to hold on to the rest.**

1. AMD Q2 revenue of $7.685B, up 32% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter,  $270M beat over $7.415B estimates.
2. Better guidance for Q3 of $8.7B, up 13% quarter-over-quarter and up 28% year-over-year V consensus of  $8.323B. Mostly on data center growth from M1355 ramp up.
3. This does not include projected $1.5B of lost China revenue, which is still awaiting approval.
4. Market share gains over Intel in CPUS from EPYC server chips, and Ryzen client chips.
5. Gaming Radeon GPUs would have been better if not for supply constraints.
6. The weaker segments, embedded is finally turning around, while gaming will remain flat in Q3
7. Weak margins remain a key concern though, which has always been AMD’s weakness and reason for the poorer multiple and lower valuation.
8. There is widespread expectation that AMD would be able to raise AI GPU prices, which are still substantially cheaper than Nvidia’s Blackwell’s but there was no explicit confirmation during the earnings call - perhaps a reason for the drop,
9. Benchmark reiterated its Buy rating on AMD PT $210 from $170. KeyBanc maintained its Sector Weight rating on AMD. Oppenheimer kept its Perform rating on AMD's stock.Meanwhile, Mizuho raised the price target on AMD's stock to $183 from $175.

Wallstreet has darlings. AMD is not one of em. Gobbling up the dip It will be after it run up in the next 6-8 months Except AMD actually produces something of value. Trimmed 10% at 180…added 12% at 160…not a large position But high, sell low, and buy again at almost double is the literal opposite of the strategy you should be following. If it helps, I am, buying if it goes down or up They have both performed the same YTD. AMD has a better opportunity for upside surprise. Own both. Diversify in your semis because upside surprise to nvidia is more limited. Invest on the expectations and tail events. My dad, who got his Econ phd back in the 60s, had a saying, buy on rumor, sell on facts. And I think that’s what we’re seeing here.

1mjaw0p,2025-08-06,"How do tracking stocks have any value?
Consider Ramaco Resources, a metallurgical coal company and a rare earth play.  Their primary class A shares are listed under “METC”.  In addition, Ramaco offers a tracking stock,  class B shares under “METB”, which ostensibly exists to track the performance of the rare earths business.  

My understanding is that in general, tracking stocks like this have no voting rights and no claim to residual earnings.   Which causes me to wonder, how do these tracking shares have any value at all, and under what circumstances would I invest in METB instead of METC, if METC is the class of share that has a vote and a claim to profits?   

Ramaco can say METB tracks the rare earths business, but how is it anything more than a piece of paper to which the company arbitrarily assigns certain profit streams?

Thanks

1mj9xz4,2025-08-06,"AMD Q2 Earnings was a headfake and why it’s trading at a discount now.
AMD reported earrings yesterday - here’s the recap.

	•	Revenue Beat: Q2 revenue hit $7.7B (+32% YoY), beating estimates of $7.4B, driven by strong client and gaming segments.

	•	EPS In Line: Adjusted EPS was $0.48, broadly in line with expectations, though margins compressed due to a $800M China-related export charge.

	•	Data Center Miss: Data center revenue rose 14% YoY to $3.2B, slightly below expectations ($3.3B), impacted by MI308 sales restrictions.

	•	Strong Q3 Guidance: AMD guided Q3 revenue to $8.7B, above consensus ($8.28B), led by AI chip ramp (MI350) and client/gaming strength.

Stock is down 8% today but I believe the market has wildly overreacted on the data center miss and the quarter over quarter decline.

Not going to get into the details and my thesis today, but beneath all the noise yesterday was this gem.

The release of ROCm 7.0 - AMD’s answer to Nvidia’s moat that is CUDA.

AMD is positioning itself to reap the benefits of the inference computing cost being the majority of where capex will be spent in the future on AI.

Think of Nvidia as providing the supercomputers for generating the weather models, but AMD wants to be the iPhone that just shows the weather app.

A bit of tangent but getting back to ROCm 7.0 - it’s 3.5x more powerful than its prior version.  That’s a significant leap forward and shows that AMD will be gaining traction with hyperscalers like META.

It’s not a matter of if, but when. That’s why I am doubling my AMD position today at these discounted prices.


Data center demand is through the stratosphere. The fact that they missed on data center revenue is a huge red flag I think. Data Center miss is due to the MI308 being restricted for sale into China. A few weeks ago (July), the administration said they plan to grant AMD an exemption going forward, which will then remove that obstacle.

If you listened to the earnings call, every metric from revenue to EPS, etc. included a statement showing what it would have been had China sales been included. With those numbers counted next quarter, things will improve dramatically :). It‘s everytime the same with Advanced Money Destroyer. There is always this „insignificant“ problem during earnings. It should be remediated fairly quickly. Sometimes it is sometimes it isn‘t. But one thing is for sure. The next little thing is waiting around the corner. 😃 [deleted] Nvidia said they would write off $15 billion in China sales and still increased data center revenue by more than all of what AMD collects. Nvidia is adding $3-5 billion in revenue every quarter and guided to that much growth even without China. There may be more growth and maybe the rising tide lifts AMD in the meantime, but Nvidia is winning now. I mean it missed data center expectations by 3% and it still grew 14% YoY. Doesn’t exactly seem like a problem or lack of demand


Overall revenue beat estimates by 4% with 32% growth. Guidance for Q3 beat estimates by 5%. 


These are numbers long term investors should be looking for. Look up AMD xilinx amortization as to why the pe is sp high It’s obvious to all that Nvidia is the leader - They have 80% of the market after all :).

That doesn’t mean, however, that their growth rate will ‘lead’ going forward. Most agree that AMD will take market share in the next 12-24 months due to an higher expected revenue growth rate in the next couple years. The MI 350 and MI 400 models coming out this Fall and next Fall will be the first actually competitive products they will have had vs. Nvidia. 

Were AMD to reduce Nvidia’s market share down to say 70% over the next two years that will have MASSIVE positive ramifications to AMD’s share price. You are correct on the numbers. Note that they missed on data centers for the 2nd Q in a row, though. Time will tell...

1mj4uvh,2025-08-06,"Is $NVDA’s market dominance over?
Everyone's piling into $NVDA like it's free money, but the disconnect between price and targets is getting weird. I saw Nvidia’s Discounted Cash Flow fair valuation, on https://stockvalu8or.com/dcf-calculator, to be $90.33. With similar valuations revolving around $90-$120, and Nvidia’s current price being $178, $NVDA has almost zero upside. 

How does everyone love it but see no upside? Even weirder, the stock is up 171% in 2024 and another 25% in 2025, trading at 55.96 P/E with a $4 trillion market cap, most semiconductor peers trade at 15-30x earnings. $NVDA at nearly 56x is pricing in perfection for years.

The competition is real now. Huawei's Ascend chips are growing in China, and NVDA took a $5.5 billion charge on H20 chip restrictions, here ‘Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Stock Price Prediction for 2025: Where Will It Be in 1 Year (July 30) - 24/7 Wall St.’ Plus Microsoft announcing $30B quarterly capex, here ‘Meta, Microsoft stocks rise on strong earnings and AI spending boom,’ means everyone's building their own chips. How long before NVDA's moat erodes?

Some analysts see $5 trillion market cap potential, found here ‘Analysts raise Nvidia price targets after Trump's China chip decision. One sees $5 trillion market cap ahead,’ but 24/7 Wall St has a cautious $147.70 target - that's 15.8% downside, article found here ‘Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Stock Price Prediction for 2025: Where Will It Be in 1 Year (July 30) - 24/7 Wall St.’ That's a massive spread between bull and bear cases. 

92% of GPU sales. Do you expect GPUs to be bought this year? I do. Everyone has been greedy af for the past decade, imagine having been fearful lol I think nvidia is far ahead of the comp. They also have software and if AI is the future, then we are just at the beginning. If Microsoft is still thriving then nvidia has room to grow as well I doubt that they will see any meaningful competition in the short term.

But i am confident in being way too late to the party to see any meaningful gains by investing in them. Be fearful when everyone is greedy I agree for the most part, looking to sell my NVDA holdings(50% profit) and hoping to enter back at a lower point. I've been invested in NVDA nearly 20 years.  What a post like this doesn't get is that Nvidia has nearly always been expensive.  DCF is not going to work, hasn't for the last 10 years.  Why?  Because Nvidia is out inventing markets that don't exist yet.   You will never be able to rationalize the investment. 

And it just goes on to continue to make new highs. 

Folks don't understand the technological leadership.  For example, yesterday Nvidia just made good on their promise for 30X performance improvement in their Blackwell chip.  Think about that.  All the smartest minds in technology investing, scheming, positioning against Nvidia and they come out with a product that blows their last generation (Hopper) out of the water not by 1 or 2X, by 30X -- all this while everyone (AMD, AWS, Google, Huawei, everyone) compares themselves, unfavorably for the most part, to Hopper. 

I've bet on the man, the CEO is every bit as talented at Jobs or Buffet.   He's made me very wealthy. Since I’m one of the few that actually works in AI on this forum, nobody is really competing with NVIDIA.  There’s some low end stuff from AMD for inference, but that’s about all it’s good for.  Nvidia has a massive advantage in both software and hardware and that’s the key factor. Their backlog is less nowadays. To get H100's in any reasonable quantities was behind a long long wait

1mirjgt,2025-08-06,"Investment opportunities with weakening dollars?
What do you guys invest if dollar keeps weakening? 

1. Stick with US companies. 
Reasons: big companies especially tech companies have much revenue from foreign countries (e.g. Apple with more than 50%: https://myfinsight.com/aapl/income). The impact is mostly neutralized

2. Foreign stocks. 
Reasons: foreign assets convert back to US dollar become more valuable (e.g. CQQQ up 20% this year. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CQQQ/)

3. Gold, Bitcoin etc. 
Reasons: same as above.

eh. I don't think its the right time to throw money in.

We are at record highs with an idiot threatening the next great depression. !remindme 12 months Hard assets. I went big on precious metals this year. Those tend to do pretty well in a stagflation environment. Avoiding crypto like plague - if Jim Cramer is telling everyone to buy, I’m gonna do the opposite. Whatever problems you might think the us economy has the chinese one has ten times over. CQQQ is up 20% this year, great, now look at the 5 year graph. 

If you want to buy int stocks, that’s great, but why would you buy a single country when there are etf that diversify between multiple countries? lol fair enough What’s also interesting, if we look at the reality, with no fiat backing, crypto is worthless. People trade crypto as a proxy for fiat — primarily USD. Its value is directly proportional to its market capitalization per token. Crypto literally cannot function without fiat systems carrying the burden of exchange.

 A crypto token as a store of value is a laughable concept because how will anyone transfer the value of a gold bar via crypto, if the entire system is baseless???? Not happening. Crypto shills are wildly irrational and delusional people.

In reality, if everything crashed, cryptocurrencies are worthless. Your friends will not take your crypto, your grocery store will not take your crypto, the banks will not give you anything of value for your FartStinkPeePee coin.

Crypto has zero intrinsic value and real world utility. Crypto is relevant in the first-world because: it’s easy to commit securities fraud and get rich from it; and can be like trading collectibles. XRP is flat out securities fraud and every crypto ICO is just an unregistered securities offering scam. 

As banks slowly come online into the real-time transactions market, cryptocurrencies will lose their only possible exit strategies. 

IMHO, cryptocurrencies are just novelties. Having a serious crypto currency allocation is like putting all of your money into rare Pokémon cards hoping t get rich someday: it’s probably easy money for a while until the market finally wakes up , leaving you as a bag holder… don’t be exit liquidity. 

Crypto is this time periods “stamp collecting,” or “rare baseball card collection.” I didn’t mean it in that sense. China has a lot of, and that’s a lot, of systemic issues. Instead of investing in a Chinese etf I would recommend and etf that diversifies between multiple countries to reduce country risk. Real estate is the best inflation hedge.

It makes no sense.  VFV and VOO are both S&P500 funds.  Literally no reason to have both.

You seem to think adding more tickers adds more diversification.  That's not the case.  Scrapping all this and buying VT would be a more diversified portfolio.  Any deviation from that needs a good evidence based explanation.  Like chasing small/value premium or something.  There's no reason to prioritize ""growth"" stocks (XGRO).  They do not historically have higher returns than value. How did you choose those? Randomly? I don't know , we can't read your mind , you gotta give us some reasoning why you picked all of these funds Vfv and voo are functionally the same. 
Xef and vxus are similar. 

The rest is a crapshoot. I dunno what kind of portfolio you're constructing. No, you are way too heavily concentrated in growth/tech which are highly correlated. This is a well-diversified portfolio for a beginner. Consider adding some bonds (BND) for stability as you gain more experience. /r/Bogleheads and the 3 fund portfolio.

Diversification does not need to be complicated. Growth has killed value for the past 15 years. I get the dilemma that ""over a long time"" yada yada yada. But you may be waiting a long time before this becomes a real long term trend that value outperforms.

Part of the issue is that the way that ""value"" is calculated as a factor for ETFs is very limited, ignores so many other important factors you would normally account for in value investing, and still has a ton of market risk due to generally higher debt levels and more pro-cyclicality in the value sector.",6,0.75,8,0,Front_Bat3307,investing,['MSFT'],diversifying properly wealthsimple account invested following 700 xgro 150 vfv 100 voo 100 xefto 100 vxus 50 figma 50 msft 50 apple 50 nvidia 50 exxon mobil 50 goog investing sectors niches taking much risk advice could nice started investment journey month ago makes sense vfv voo sp500 funds literally reason seem think adding tickers adds diversification thats case scrapping buying vt would diversified portfolio deviation needs good evidence based explanation like chasing smallvalue premium something theres reason prioritize growth stocks xgro historically higher returns value choose randomly dont know cant read mind gotta give us reasoning picked funds vfv voo functionally xef vxus similar rest crapshoot dunno kind portfolio youre constructing way heavily concentrated growthtech highly correlated welldiversified portfolio beginner consider adding bonds bnd stability gain experience rbogleheads 3 fund portfolio diversification need complicated growth killed value past 15 years get dilemma long time yada yada yada may waiting long time becomes real long term trend value outperforms part issue way value calculated factor etfs limited ignores many important factors would normally account value investing still ton market risk due generally higher debt levels procyclicality value sector

1mhppwu,2025-08-04,"What factors to consider while selling TIPS ?
I bought some TIPS, by mistake ( got confused on the treasury website where i actually wanted to buy a Series I bond, during the high yield years)

**Question** \- what factors to consider if I should sell these at a loss (may be to harvest stock gains) ? Should i persist for some 'x' amount of time, before throwing in the towel (and may be buy NVDA to cover up for all the losses :D )
If you still feel that way, and feel like your money is better elsewhere (or in cash) then there shouldn't be any reason to keep them. The only thing you would be losing are the 3 years of maturity you've ""earned"" on them, but you could say that wasn't worth the price you paid, so far.

However, if you have the time, here's a post by Jurrien Timmer that might give you some more insight: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/closer-mile-week-8425-jurrien-timmer-snkre/?trackingId=wDNgBk%2B%2BSAqR2D%2F3hUCxSg%3D%3D

> The soft jobs data pushed the forward curve back down to 3%, with the market now expecting the next rate cut in September.  With the TIPS break-even curve stable at the 2.50-2.75% range, in my view a neutral policy would be around 3.50-3.75%.  That means that the market is expecting that the Fed will go past neutral and into the accommodative zone. Hypothetically, if you had not taken any losses (or hypothetical gains), would you spend your current balance on TIPS today?
If yes, what would be your time horizon, x? What is the year to date return? Any bond purchased at the beginning of 2022 will have lost value as that was one of the worst years for bonds. But, they should be doing OK recently.

When do they mature? 

Are they in an IRA or 401K?  TIPS can be a bit of a pain in terms of taxes if in a taxable brokerage account due to ""tips phantom tax"". They went down in value because yields(future expected return) went up. Yields and prices are inverse of each other.

TIPS had negative yields at the time you bought them, but at current prices, they yield about 1.5-2% + inflation.

Buying Nvidia wont magically fix your mistake unless you have a time machine. It's already had its run. ha, i would probably never have bought TIPS, bought it by mistake originally :( it matures in 2032 (10 year TIPS bought in 2022) and is in taxable brokerage

1mgwm23,2025-08-03,"""At that P/E rate, it would take 'X' years to recoup your investment""
I heard this today on a video about palantir. The guy said it has a P/E of 670, meaning it would take you 670 YEARS to get your money back.

I searched google and had a long conversation with ChatGPT that went nowhere. I now understand P/E ratios when it comes to ""*A P/E of 670 means you pay $670 for every $1 the company earns annually""* because I heard a great vending machine analogy and I read a comparison about Microsoft.

(**Machine** **costs $2,000 up front. makes $200 a year; P/E = 10x**).

What I **don't** understand is the notion that it would take **ME,** the **STOCK INVESTOR**, that much time.

I feel blindsighted by the fact that the only money I will ever see is from when the value of the stock goes up.

The ""670 years"" thing to me makes no sense. Not that it makes no sense, as in I understand where it's coming from, but it's just untrue to me. It makes no sense **simply because I don't get it**, and can't find any resources that know what I mean when posing my question.

The root of my problem may be my ability to explain my confusion, but I tried to do my best to put it all together here, and the clarity seems perfect to me. Maybe the issue is everyone takes this phrase a face value and doesn't think about its meaning?... Idk.

The vending machine analogy was a great way for me to understand it when it comes to someone who actually gets the profit, but I'm completely failing to comprehend its connection to investing.

(Video with timestamp for context: https://youtu.be/raE9f9swVxU?si=UgpbCeGxiwqEY20G&t=666)
In the old days, people used to invest in stocks primarily to get a dividend, which is a share of profit you receive proportional to your ownership stake (i.e. number of stocks).  Most companies these days reinvest their profits into growth (or use profit to buy back shares) rather than distribute dividends to shareholders.

When they say it would take you X years to ""get your money back,"" they mean at current earnings your proportion of the profits would take X years to pay back the capital you spend to buy the stock.  It has nothing to do with selling the stock. And that X years calculation assumes that earnings stay exactly the same, which most people are betting is not the case. If the company continued to make the same profit now into eternity, it would take 670 years to recoup your investment because you’re paying 670 years of profits discounted to present value It is confusing because there are two (theoretical) ways to make money investing - receiving dividends/profit directly, and appreciation of the stock price.  They are loosely related, in that the more profitable a company is, the more valuable it is perceived to be.

Historically, P/E ratio was a method to determine how valuable a particular stock was relative to other stocks, and for decades has been a bedrock of stock valuation.  Seen from the perspective of someone chasing dividends, it makes perfect sense - if two stocks have the same P/E ratio, your dividend per dollar invested should be the same for both stocks.

In more modern times, stock price appreciation has overtaken dividends as the primary way that people make money from stocks. It is essentially speculation, betting that the stock price will increase for various reasons, as opposed to the more antiquated sort of investing that expected a relatively constant profit from an established company.

In the last 30 years, P/E ratios have increasingly diverged from stock prices.  Stock valuations have become increasingly speculative, i.e. not based on any fundamental principles but on the expectation of future profit.  I suspect much of this is driven by the massive increase in currency supply - there is simply a lot of money circulating in the economy that has been created out of thin air, and only so many places to put it where it won't rot with inflation.  It'll keep working until it doesn't. This is it. It also is the stepping stone question as to how does growth factor into valuing a stock. 670 p/e is awful if 0 growth. Now if you have 200% growth, possibly undervalued. Then you start looking to ROI and MEROI Let’s suppose you don’t buy a stock. You buy the whole company. And you want 100% of the profits to your pocket.

It would take you 670 years until you can get your money back. This is the most clear answer ive seen so far. The idea is still a bit foggy but getting cleared. I think one of the roots of the problem is how the guy used the phrase/ the context he said it. 

  
I put a link to the video and timestamp at the bottom, id love it if you could give it a watch and help me understand if this notion is true To be a worthy investment, you want your rate of return to be higher than the risk-free rate. If your hypothetical investment grows at 2% per year, you're better off just buying bonds or treasuries.


And since a total stock market index fund is basically the baseline longterm investment vehicle for most people nowadays, you really need your investments to beat the total market index--otherwise you're just better off in the index.


But investing based off of anticipated future share prices isn't investing, it's speculating. When you invest in a company, you're offering up your money today in exchange for anticipated future profits. P/E captures that perfectly, and share prices typically move in tandem with projected forward earnings.


Palantir is sustaining a 600x P/E because it is expected to grow its earnings substantially in the near-term. If Palantir's earnings double every year for the next 4 years (which is basically what's being projected by buyers), it'll have a 37.5 P/E, which is a reasonable P/E for a blue chip growth company.


Something like bitcoin has no anticipated future profits because it generates no earnings. Its price is totally dependent on the greater fool theory--speculation that someone someday will pay you more than you already paid. There is nothing like P/E for bitcoin because bitcoin has no value other than your hope that someone else will buy it from you in the future. It’s not a lie. It’s about the fundamental value of a stock. 

It’s about putting things into perspective, and making you ask yourself if something is overvalued. You wouldn’t pay a kid $67,000 for their lemonade stand just because they profited $100 selling lemonade for a year (this is basically what Palantir is valued at now). You would have to expect the kid to start selling way way more lemonade in the future to justify this price.

Would you invest into the kid’s lemonade business at this valuation? Why do you think Palantir is different?

Some investments are less about fundamentals and believing the asset/business is going to earn money, and more about the assumption someone else will buy it from you again for a hopefully bigger price at some point (greater fool theory). Like expensive paintings, bitcoin, tesla, palantir, gamestop, etc. And, following your point, sometimes you have a 100/1 P/E with 1000% growth and yet it's overvalued.

1mgl5qe,2025-08-03,"Bearish on Tesla - tell me why I am wrong!
I own a model Y and a few Tesla stocks but I am increasingly finding it challenging to see how the current valuation is sensible.

- Cars - Margin pressure is not going away. Sit in a BYD car and you will know why. Tesla remains strong but will not have market dominance especially as both legacy, Chinese and Korean makers catch up. Look at market share in EU and China. Superchargers are great but still are primarily used during trips. I did a roadtrip in Germany and every place I stayed in had a charger. Used superchargers twice and they were 20% occupancy. My take is you add the market cap of bmw, Mercedes and VW and add a buffer you are looking at 200b.
- Robotaxi - there is potential here but seriously they have competition. Also assume Tesla Robotaxi is 50% the size of Uber (which is a globally scaled brand and did 11 billion trips and has a thriving food delivery business) the market cap is 100b
- Optimus prime - at best it's a 10b valuation because it's so early in it's product life cycle. Google and look at the competition. The Chinese are a formidable force with immense support from their government.
- Solar - it's cool, but at this point it's a primarily US product with competition.

Overall, if I am being generous, it's a $400b company. 

Tell me what justifies the $1t market cap. So many people can't be wrong, so I must be missing something really basic. Some analysts are saying it will almost double from current levels. 
You’re wrong because it’s a meme stock, it’s price isn’t based on the realities of the business “Tell me what justifies the $1t market cap”

Nothing. 

“So many people can't be wrong”

Yes they can.

Be careful betting against Tesla. The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent You're not wrong, but good luck making money shorting it. Tesla trades irrationally and best to just ignore it. You’re not wrong When you have tens of thousands of disaffected young men, with nothing going for them in life, who have bought high and invested their identity in a cult of personality, the rational markets hypothesis goes out the window. what does that have to do with what I said? I’m not suggesting anyone should buy the stock or anything BYDs are awesome, best EV in the price range This is the real answer. Another day, another Tesla or Google post.

20 yr, have around 6k invested with in IVV, A200, PLTR, and NVDA. With a 40:60 split between etf and stocks. Should I increase the weighting of my portfolio to become a 60:40 with ETFs being the majority, and would it be good to diversify into another etf that covers ie Asia or European markets?

I think this is what the OP is trying to say. I don't know why people freely give their age and gender on the internet. One more datapoint for our AI overlords. IVV and A200 already give you strong US and Australian exposure, but adding an international ETF covering Europe and Asia would diversify your portfolio and reduce home bias. Broad global ETFs smooth out volatility compared to relying heavily on single stocks like NVDA or PLTR. Focus on building a long-term structure, mostly global ETFs with a smaller slice in individual stocks you believe in and keep adding consistently.

I don’t want to use a third party access site which basically leaves my only option as manual entry right? I don’t mind this but the issue I am running into is the commonly recommended google drive file for this kind of thing doesn’t have : vanguard institutional total international stock market index trust. This fund doesn’t have a ticker and is different to the mutual fund equivalent (VTSNX).

>	vanguard institutional total international stock market index trust. 

While you are correct that they are not *exactly* the same, the difference in performance will be negligible to VTSNX.

So just use VTSNX as a surrogate. I track all of my investments from my retirement account and individual accounts on google sheets.  For those funds that are offered in my retirement account that are not publicly available, I track them by finding another fund that tracks the same thing (if possible), try to compute a multiple of the difference between their two prices (usually based upon past close prices), and then in google sheets I take the publicly traded fund, modify it by the computed multiple, and it then gives me a close approximation of what the actual fund is doing. Look into Airtable you can enter the data and create nice interfaces there ideal for keeping track in investments Some banking/brokerage apps let you track balances of 3rd party brokerage accounts. Another option could be to rollover/transfer everything into VG, where your 401(k) is, since Fidelity Roth IRA isn’t tied to employer. For aggregating everything in one place, a lot of people have success with services like Personal Capital (now Empower Personal Dashboard) or Kubera. They both have their strengths. Empower is great for a free, high-level overview and retirement planning, while Kubera is a paid service but can track a wider variety of assets, including crypto and international accounts. Have you looked into either of those, and what are the main features you're hoping to get from an aggregator? I have the same issue with a Vanguard target date fund. In my aggregated online setup I use the symbol available for the fund as a placeholder for the institutional version. But, when I manually update, I take the dollar value of the institutional shares and divide by the current price of the symbol I have access too and use that as the number of shares to enter in the aggregated online setup. When done after hours, and done correctly, the two will show the same value. There is a slight drift across a month's time and I just correct for it monthly when manually updating the aggregated list.

In terms of back-dating, I'm not sure you can do that using my approach due to the ""drift"". Perhaps if you had the total value 1.5 years back? Still, re-invested dividends, and other investments over time would probably not be correctly accounted for. but will it muddy the accuracy of the analysis since the share price is different between the two?

Unfortunately 403B is very hard to get data readily available unless you give us your access (don’t). It’s very hard to map the funds to a public ticker. 

I suggest you approach it to take is write down the allocation numbers for your existing funds and funds of interest. Focus on 2 primary groups of allocation 
- stock weight and bond weight 
- stock country or just region weights (US, Euro, Asia, etc)
- set 2 targets 
  - what’s your desired asset allocation. (90 stock/10 bond)
  - what’s your desired geographic allocation (within stocks 50 US, 50 intl?)
- look at the funds that can get you to it and rebalance to that weightings. 
- there are some math you’ll have to do to calculate how much dollar value is 90% stock and so on. 
- those 2 high level allocation weight generally drives a lot of your risk profile.


Add on: you can probably achieve target with as little as 3 funds. Try to keep it super simple and not over complicate it.

Post title, but a little more in depth.  Full disclosure, I hold 4800 shares of MGRM - on Webull. They recently entered into an acquisition agreement with Zimmer Biomet in which Zimmer is paying cash at $4.04/share and then electronic CVR rights with five milestones.  However,  from what I've read on CVRs, they're usually for future events. The first two milestones in his agreement have already occurred.

I've been invested in this for several years at this point. A quick Google search reveals (and has already been news for a while at this point) Monogram's 510(k) approval.

The last three milestones are contingent on increasing gross revenue by December 2028, 2029 and 2030, and I do believe have not been hit yet, so I didn't include them here.

1mf0udr,2025-08-01,"CVX at $100 is my target for a buy
I wouldn't pay more than $100 for CVX. I'm gonna get that buy zone soon enough. Aramco is on my side, they are dumping the oil market and it'll catchup to the US soon.

At $100 though, CVX would be a great buy.

I think the capital structure of the oil majors is fine, I just think their ""driller's treadmill"" is too severe right now and doesn't justify the price. $XLE is way too expensive. $CVX is my favored of the pack. But I think $XOM is slightly stronger but is too greedy with their cashflow as a shareholder.

There's other better oil companies down the stream but I prefer to stay in the majors.

OII is a great oil play for instance at the technical level. But I never bought it even though I check it time to time for health of the industry since they rely so much on ROVs.
I’m highly skeptical you’ll see CVX at $100/share, but if you do, I’ll be right there buying with you. You have to go back around 3 or so years to find that price. I usually pick up shares around $130-135. Yeah, just another small -35% and you are there. What price of oil would a drop like that imply? $20-$25? i like both You’ll be waiting for awhile if ever. What do you mean by Exxon being too greedy with their cashflow ? 

I'm an European looking to invest in US Oil, not familiar yet with the big players The last time CVX was that low, oil prices went negative…

Out of all the US oil companies, vertically integrated XOM/CVX are the best able to weather a storm. The smaller upstream players like FANG and OXY are the ones that technically will see margin pressures.

At the end of the day, O&G is cyclic and the way these companies handle markets being flooded is to cut working capital (layoffs) and shutdown wells (which will actually hurt the economy)

You might get lucky and see 120, but that would be a stretch.

1memyer,2025-08-01,"Some people treating Amazon, UNH or even UPS as a Mullen, AMC kind of stock.
Come on people….! 

They are making money. Stop moaning about all those great businesses. 

I saw one post today saying “Amazon is real crap stock” 

And the same person holding AMC/GME in his/her portfolio. 

Really?

Just stay away from individual stocks if you can’t handle the volatility. 




Amazon is real crap stock and I hope it crashes back to under $100...

so I can buy more hahaha I think it’s less about not wanting to hold individual stocks but rather people complaining that the stocks they have don’t make short term gains while the internet and reddit are constantly shoving news about stocks moving 5, 10, even 100% in a few days. I’m sure a lot of people had fomo when OPEN DNUT all spiked This, that’s the plan…! Does it matter if it's profitable but drops 60% ? Earnings beating the estimate and it’s down after hours makes no sense. That’s become the norm lately. Great quarter. Profits and it sinks the following day. Fundamentals aren’t what they use to be  Yes you should like it *more* after the drop not less How is UPS not a crap stock. Been going down since like 2020. Think it’s back to the same levels in 2012. UPS is hamstrung by higher labor costs due to their Teamsters contracts.  Amazon is non-Union in its warehouses and uses non-Union drivers and gig workers.  No pension payments, lower healthcare, etc.  It used to be that UPS had the established local infrastructure to be the only game in town (USPS aside).  Now that Amazon built out local infrastructure, it does not need UPS. UPS is up 20% from where it IPO'd about 25 years ago. It's not a 0 tomorrow or anything of that nature, but its not good either and when they announce that they're going to lose half the business of their largest customer (Amazon) by 2H26,  I don't know what entirely replaces that. Carol Tome is a good CEO but I don't know what someone can do to transform what UPS is at this point. 

UNH is a situation where people think that buy the dip mentality can be applied across the board when household names decline but in this case when people don't take the time to understand the dynamics of the intentionally very complex insurance industry, they're not getting the full picture - then the stock goes down another $50.  And then another peer reports lousy earnings too and they all go down further. NVO has gotten short-term too oversold /obliterated but that's another name where Reddit thought buy the dip without really getting the full picture of why the decline happened would work. It went down 21% the other day after they lowered guidance for the second time in three months and so far...has just kept heading South. 

AMZN being down is an instance where people's investment time horizon has become ""until the line stops going up."" People on here are waaaaaayyyyyy more ultra short term then they were several years ago.  Stock is still up 21% YTD and yet there's going to be so much complaining that it's down. People complain about GOOG incessantly and it's like, ""Okay, sell it and buy something else""- and they never want to.

 I will say that AMZN's perforomance over the last 5 years is ... not great. Plus, I'm sure Bezos has more to sell. I will admit that when I started trading, that kind of stuff caught my eye all the time.  Didn't study the market with any depth, and bought a bunch of penny level biotech stocks.

1mehsu8,2025-08-01,"Would You Rather Hold NVDA or VOO for the Next 6 Months?
From what I have seen since pre-covid, capital is constantly flowing from one sector to another. I don't believe diversifying into different companies, is as important as the actual sector or asset class.

For example, US stock market was down bad in first 2 quarters because of tariffs, but gold was doing well. Had you sold off all your stocks when the market was on a downward trend, you would have dry powder to rotate your money to where capital is flowing, which was gold.  

Right now, AI and Tech has momentum again and in my opinion, it's better to hold NVDA instead of VOO since VOO lumps in low performers to help you ""diversify"".

But that doesn't even mean anything if the entire market crashes. NVDA is S&P 1 so it's not like you're throwing into unproven companies, and it certainly has a lot more to gain from the momentum than VOO.

Thoughts?
This is the repeat question of individual stocks vs index funds VOO; holds plenty of NVDA already along with everything else. Look at the top S&P500 stocks from 2010, 2000, 1990, 1980 and see if they’re still near the top. No one knows. And throw in market timing too? Both or example, US stock market was down bad in first 2 quarters because of tariffs, but gold was doing well. Had you sold off all your stocks when the market was on a downward trend, you would have dry powder to rotate your money to where capital is flowing, which was gold.

1megpzy,2025-07-31,"AMD will reprice during earnings next week. Most still won’t understand why.
My tech earnings calls this quarter have been accurate (GOOGL, MSFT, META, RDDT). AMD is next.

What’s being missed:

AMD is gaining quiet traction from Nvidia in segments that care about control and efficiency - specifically open-source AI deployments. That preference isn’t ideological, it’s architectural.

The core demand is coming from three categories:

	1.	Sovereign buyers (EU, Middle East) who won’t bet their AI stack on a black-box vendor.

	2.	Hyperscalers (MSFT, META, Oracle) selectively onboarding AMD into their model training workflows to reduce vendor lock-in.

	3.	Startups and smaller firms where unit economics matter, and AMD’s open-source orientation offers clear flexibility advantages.

The idea that Nvidia has a permanent hardware monopoly is a form of mental laziness. AMD doesn’t need to “beat” Nvidia - it only needs to absorb the non-Nvidia demand that’s scaling underneath the narrative.

The market is large. The shift is already happening.
Most investors are still pricing AMD as if it isn’t.

No ones missing it bro, they just don’t value AMD. I’ve been a big holder of AMD since 1.89/ share. No one listened back then and they are doing the same now. 

In the end they will see what has been there all the way since 2015… I’m long lol Alright bro 80% of tech stock has been up after earnings calm down CUDA is NVDA’s biggest moat at this point. Does your “open source AI deployments” address that? Or is that just a phrase that looks like it means something until someone with any domain specific knowledge looks at it.

I’m long AMD but let’s be realistic about the size of the gaps here. I was dropped on my head as a child I held NVDA since 2008. I've sold it all now. I still have all my AMD. > The idea that Nvidia has a permanent hardware monopoly is a form of mental laziness. AMD doesn’t need to “beat” Nvidia

The problem with this theory is that the companies buying AMD GPUs don’t know what they are doing because, if they did, they’d buy Nvidia GPUs instead as that is what their competitors are doing. These companies won’t last compared to those doing business with Nvidia.

If you don’t work in this field and just listen to conference calls you have no idea the lead and capabilities Nvidia offers over… Well everyone.

I think AMD offers value in the CPU space over Intel. That is their strength but their support sucks for Enterprise. AMD in my mind has turned into a prosumer company. I love them in custom white label server/home builds. Would I spend hundreds of millions building a data center using them for CPUs and GPUs. I don’t think so. Big “That preference isn’t ideological, it’s architectural.”

Isn’t this bot language? Various sections seem like what a LLM would produce plus the post history spamming the same posts to multiple subs isn’t a good sign. Who is going to bet 1-5GW deployments on hardware nobody has deployed before?

Hyperscalers deploy according to customer demand. It is lacking for anything non-nvidia. See previous point about trust when allocating capex/opex.

AMD is not “open source” in the way you’re talking about it. These products are ultimately export controlled so nothing is open source. 

AMD currently lacks rackscale products but they are on the horizon. Whether they execute well, remains unknown. This goes beyond the specs of individual chips.

All that being said, I do think AMD will eventually grab market share. It just won’t be this earnings. 2027 maybe.  > The problem with this theory is that the companies buying AMD GPUs don’t know what they are doing because, if they did, they’d buy Nvidia GPUs instead as that is what their competitors are doing. These companies won’t last compared to those doing business with Nvidia.

AMD GPUs are significantly cheaper and hyperscalers like Amazon and Microsoft have every incentive in the world to make sure they’re not beholden to a single vendor.  I hope you’re not suggesting these companies “don’t know what they’re doing”.

1meeasm,2025-07-31,"META will have to stop buybacks or offer debt to offset AI investment cost
https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000162828025036719/meta-06302025xexhibit991.htm

Page 7 ""Condensed consolidated statement of cash flows"".

In 2025 META has spent $46B on investment activities on the back of $50B in net cash provided by operating activities.  In q2 investment activities was $300M more than cash provided by operating activities ($25.6b v $25.9B)

They have also spent $35B on financing activities in 2025, $22B from buying back stock.  In q2 $16B was used for financing activities $10B from buybacks.

This has drained their cash and equivalent position by just over $30B in 2025.  To continue to fund their AI investments which are supposed to be another $30B for q3/4 and then $60B in 2026 they will have to stop the buybacks or take on debt.
I mean one of the benefits of doing buy backs vs dividends is investors do not tend to revolt if you need to stop by backs

In theory a company should do buy backs when they have excess cash and no where else to deploy it. if they find something to deploy it on (expansion , acquisitions ) well stop the buy backs

Now you can argue if AI is worth it, but META seems to think it is, and investors seem to be bullish on AI so I don't see this being an issue in the short term. These companies have very low leverage, adding $50-150B in debt is 100% on the table. One thing to keep in mind is that the hefty employee compensation commonly includes stocks for meta. The buybacks ideally maintain the same dilution levels at a minimum to prevent that from affecting valuations. It's a major thing to keep in mind for tech stocks. I think it will actually be well received, these companies have been adverse to employing much debt. But debt is a powerful tool. They can use it to fund projects but also to buy back more stock and pay dividends. Signally that they are open to using debt aggressively when it's called for is a good thing IMO. 

If they were not printing money in their core business it would be a major red flag but they are making more money than they ever had by far. I agree I think it'll move the market when people hear a ""cash printer"" is having to leverage up maybe I'm wrong? If you are ignoring their markable securities (35B) and the additional 16B they invested in their non-marketable securities then sure.

Their CFO is very good. Or increase cash from operations which is what they are doing. Companies generally don't want to tie themselves down unless they have to. There is limited value in telling the market we will issue debt in 6-18 months when maybe something changes between now and then. If you compare the market value of the equity, $50B in debt is immaterial. So there is no cause for markets to worry about how they will come up with it. 

I can tell you, some long credit managers are salivating at the idea of being able to buy up lots of 20-30 year bonds from FB, Amazon, MSFT. 

There will be ample demand for their bonds at even only a small spread over treasuries. 

Now, the biggest risk is that these investments don't translate into any meaningful revenue. And if that happens, paying for them is not going to be the concern, it's what that means for these company's long term future. There is a 1% tax on stock buybacks, but it is based on net buybacks. If Meta was smart, they would at least buy enough stock to offset the dilution since it is untaxed.

1me9j08,2025-07-31,"Nvidia’s China-bound H20 AI chips face Beijing scrutiny over ‘tracking’ and security concerns
You know how the US has been concerned about how Chinese technology may have security concerns. That Chinese tech is spyware. It seems the Chinese have the same concern about US tech. They are now openly looking into whether they can trust Nvidia GPUs. With the US history of putting backdoors into US tech before shipping it overseas, that seems to be a reasonable concern. Will the Chinese actually allow the H20 to be sold in China? I guess this explains why no Chinese company has applied to get an export license for the H20.

https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/31/china-probes-nvidia-h20-chips-for-tracking-risks.html
lol Murican politicians literally called for planting tracking and backdoor into NVDA cards days ago. The H20 is not the ""most powerful chips in the world"". The Huawei 910C/920 is just as powerful. So they aren't beggars. They have their own solution. Thus why they are putting up barriers to the H20. Since they really don't need it. This isn't the first barrier. Before we even put up the export ban, China was already talking about banning the H20 due to it being so power inefficient. It’s just an attempt at Astro turfing reddit to make people believe that China is ahead of the United States in every aspect, very common from Canadian-Chinese immigrants. If all the want is the H100, then why do they want it at all? Since the 910C can match the H100. The 920 should be able to beat it.

The H100 is 2 gens old. Behind Grace and Blackwell. Even Jensen says that China's own chips are only 1 gen behind Nvidia. > If they had other chips available they wouldn’t be crying about this and just outright ban the chips.

They aren't crying about it.

> China cannot produce similar chips to nvidia and that is fact.

The fact is China can. As in they actually produce their own chips. They don't rely on a third party to produce it. Nvidia doesn't make anything. It needs TSMC to make their chips for them. Huawei makes it's own chips. Those are the facts.

https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/huawei-already-has-a-new-chip-to-rival-nvidia-ai-gpus Again you’re attempting to Astro turf on reddit just look at your account it is completely bias towards… again CHINA. 


There’s a lot more to the chips than just manufacturing and China clearly cannot keep up otherwise they would not be batting an eye at Taiwan which they want for chips. Huawei allowed intelligence services, particularly British intelligence, access so they could see if there were any security concerns. Will Western firms do the same?  Especially in light of the history of western states to utilize the civilian supply chain for spying, sabotage and violent attacks. China doesn't need h20, they want h100 What’s your point?

1me96vx,2025-07-31,"Shorting a little more SPY
With shorting you start small and if it keeps working then keep building the position. Not quite the same as DCA'ing into longs where, for me at least, I just have target portfolio allocations and add in bulk when able or when the price looks right.

But, today SPY looks like it's just weakening before August and will retest the 100 day moving average which is below 200 day moving average. Price ALWAYS retests 100day moving average if it crosses above 200day.

So this type of trade is now seeming high probability.

I use call-credit spreads to make synthetic shorts. This way I can control break-even cost basis. I'm keeping my cost basis a nice healthy \~3-5% higher than the current price.

So far this has been generating more and more money lately so it fits the ""if it's working add to it"" maxim of short trading.

I can remain ""mid-to-long term bullish"" but still keep a short-term bearish outlook because of that fact that price always retests the 100day crossing above 200day area.

But, in actuality unless the market has a healthy pullback and soon, I'm extremely long-term bearish because rate cuts will hit the market like a ton of bricks, flood the housing market with supply, dump prices all across the board and reveal just how weak the economy really is as equity in many asset classes goes into the toilet.

We aren't there yet. Fed keeps delaying Armageddon by a month at a time, like Trump says: ""See you in September"".

Yes by then the global economy is probably a dumpster fire and Powell will look like a fool waiting that long to cut.
A call credit spread isn't a synthetic short. It has a very different p/l curve at expiration than an actual synthetic short. 

How do you expect long term rates to react if the Fed actually cuts the overnight rate? 

Longer term rates are market driven. And iirc - the last rate cut didn't really have much impact on the 10 and 20 year. I think those rates actually went up when the short term rates were cut. It matters to people that don't understand the differences. I use both synthetic shorts and call credit spreads regularly. They serve different purposes.

If your goal was to reduce the delta of an existing long SPY position - using a synthetic short, short combo, or call credit spread have very different P/L curves and serve different purposes.

Your comments and posts are very laissez-faire in style. But I recognize what you are actually trying to do. But these kinds of rambling posts and comments will not be helpful to most people. That is the nature of derivatives. Yes - it is all synthetic. But the term ""synthetic short"" normally introduces a collar to an existing position. A call credit spread doesn't have the same collar effect. And it can require different types of management. 

As an active trader - you likely understand how to adjust the trades. 

But in this subreddit - most people will not understand what you mean. If you don't take the time to be specific and you are simply posting whatever comes to mind - it's not going to be well received in this subreddit. Feel like I'm watching the first act of *Bad Lieutenant* To expand on my use of ""synthetic"" it's because everything is all the same. You can make a ""synthetic"" position equal whatever you want it to be. It can be long, short, Beta 1.0 to Spy, or beta 0.5, or beta 2.0. Etc etc.

It can cost prime+2% interest, it can cost 1% interest. I think it's important to realize that you can just do whatever and it's all the same.

You can turn ""GLD"" into ""SPY"" if you wanted, it's all ""synthetic"" to me. The 10 or 30 won’t start serious movement until this tariff BS is handled. I see your point, but 2026 we get a new Fed chair and we know who they’ll be loyal to and what that person wants. Food for thought, it’s different times. Regarding rates - the last rate cut had the EXPECTED impact that any first rate cuts have, go look through history - mark first rate cuts on a chart and just watch what happens. The first rate cuts especially in an early phase of a business cycle tend to do ""nothing"" to rates. And long-duration rates tend to just be volatile.

We've seen that exact behavior.

All rates form a ""price curve"" if you want to chart it where they do what I call ""cheese knife"". The look like a cheese knife as they get to a ceiling. Look at a 1month rate and you'll see it looks like that as it approaches the Fed Funds rates.

Long duration rates do it too, it just takes longer and has bigger volatility, as expected.

We are now in the ""end"" of the cheese knife phase for long-duration. When the Fed starts cutting again it'll be chasing the long-duration curve. Let me be less hostile, I called it synthetic because it's a manufactured short position, not a bought short shares paying interest. The interest on short shares and the defined risk on a credit call spread is the same difference. The actual ""resulting expiration price"" would be your paid-interest if any. It's all the same stuff.

These are all correlated with each other, so when tech drops your whole portfolio is going to get slammed, and when tech is doing well these are all going to rise together

Of course there will be outliers but in general it won't actually matter how much you allocate for each ticker

I would suggest incorporating some non-tech non-crypto to your portfolio I promise you OP ain't listening to a word you typed lol Crypto is pure gambling and you shouldn’t consider part of a responsible investment portfolio.  why do you say that? I'm listening and doing my best to learn. As mentioned, I'm new and open/eager for input! Thanks so much. I do appreciate all this input. Any recommendations of how to reallocate so I'm less tech heavy? Basin advice is to keep most of your portfolio in index funds. If you want to be heavy in tech look at QQQ Make sure you don’t need the money for 5 years plus. Try setting up auto invest after your lump sum. QQQM to make things easier. Work to increase that auto invest. 

That’s all investing is: spend less than you earn, have emergency fund, have auto invest plan, sell only when you have something urgent to pay for, do that every month of your life. 

Depending on how much money you are investing, you will experience a lot of emotions with the volatility of those choices. Lump sum is optimal, but it is a “big boy advanced move”. Best of luck out there! I only DCA when stocks are undervalued. My apologies friend. It's just that usually folks come to the sub asking for advice. Someone tells them something completely different than they want to hear (but the correct answer). And you can very easily spot in real time that good advice being ignored. Im sorry for lumping you into that group if that isn't you. Best of luck in all of your endeavors. As others have mentioned you are too tech heavy. I think good advice for MOST people (not exclusively new people) is that you really shouldn't be buying individual stocks. Instead, you should buy the market as a whole. Examples would be an S&P 500 index (VOO, SPY.), or since you clearly prefer tech a NASDAQ index like QQQ. It's impossible to know which companies will even be around in 10 or 20 years, much less which ones will stock will increase in value. But buying the whole market is akin to making a bet that businesses will generally be profitable and generate a return. This has mostly been true going back hundreds of years.

All of them are so highly valued right now. I would like to invest more but how much higher can they go before it drops?

 Rates will not come down because GDP numbers show growth and tarrifs putting pressure on this to raise prices too. Although it seems retail is absorbing the costs for now, I anticipate they won't for much longer.

I won't talk about crypto or stablecoins here

Can't beat the fixed income rates now though especially for ones closer to or at retirement. 

 Question if one should be 
 short: retail- 25%
 long: energy, mega tech 20%
Long Corporate bonds at 25%
Speculative 5% (quantum, crypto)
Rest in cash/money market at 25%

The money thinks the market is good.

You can disagree with that if you want, but the signals all show they believe the AI is a boom, not a bubble. Except that they generated $3,000,000,000 of unexpected revenue. 

An extra billion is considered amazing. $3B is a home run beat. 

Bubbles typically aren’t backed by legitimate increases in cash flow. Isn't this true for all bubbles too  Meta is up 12% and their PE ratio went *down*. Think about that. Their price went up 12% and their earnings went up more than that in this quarter alone. Amazon and Apple have to deliver as well today. If they stumble, could cause some trouble imo.

1mdva00,2025-07-31,"Is it worth buying a hedged ETF for 3/4x the total expense ratio?
So basically I was thinking about buying an S&P 500 ETF (leaning towards the SPDR Acc.) which has a 0.03% ter. However most of the etfs similar to this one are all currency unhedged. I live in Europe so I use EUR. Is it worth buying the iShares Hedged etf (IUSE) for 0.2% ter, but having the peace of mind that it is currency hedged? Or is the ETF being unhedged not something I should really worry about? Thanks.
it is something you should worry about.  But imo the USD is done falling against the Euro.  The difference between .03 and .12 isn't a huge sum either way, so whatever makes you sleep better at night, would be my answer. Yeah, currency risk is definitely real. I'd agree the USD has probably bottomed out against EUR for now. The expense difference is minimal in the grand scheme - we're talking about a 0.09% difference annually. If hedging helps you avoid panic selling during currency swings, that peace of mind is worth the small premium. Just pick one and start investing,  that's what matters most. Long term always unhedged for me I'm unsure whether the USD will fall against the Euro, but then again I think the difference between 0.03 and 0.20 is quite significant. If for the sake of the argument one makes 1000 euro in profits, a 2euro cut vs a 0.3 euro cut is relatively significant.

** Edited the amounts cause they were calculated wrong which also made me realise how insignificant it is. Yeah. Either way I'll be in for the long run, so I'm guessing things will even out either way. 200 on 1000 would be 20%, not 0.20% ChatGPT can't do even basic math.

It can summarise short articles for you but it *can't think*, it's quite dumb. And by following the advice of someone dumb like ChatGPT you'll lose a lot of money I think you may have done the math wrong. It's 0.20%, not 0.2 and same for 0.03.

1mdsoia,2025-07-31,"Could tariffs be good for Amazon?
So in the lead up to earnings there has been a lot of talk about what to expect. Seems to me the two main themes have been:

- AWS should continue with huge growth, as we’ve seen from Google and msft’s earnings reports with their cloud sectors reporting 32% and 34% YoY rev increases.

- Tariffs will have hit the retail side of the business and could mean figures come under expectations.

Now it’s this second point I am wondering about. I understand much of Amazon sales would be hit with tariffs but I would have thought that the tariffs also meant that users of Temu, Shein, AliExpress have all moved back to Amazon and are now hoping to avoid tariffs (at least on some purchases) via Amazon.

So I’m wondering could this traffic shift to Amazon actually offset any negative impacts from tariffs, even possibly resulting in an unexpected upside from returning customers?
The tariffs on Amazon’s Temu level products are the same as Temu’s Temu level products so I don’t understand a thesis that tariffs create differentiation in their shared market segments. Amazon itself (not sure about the sellers on the platform) might be able to leverage overall lower shipping costs as they move goods in bulk, and they might have potentially already imported a large quantity of items when the tariffs were not being applied, while others mostly ship individual items from outside the US directly to buyers. Other than that, I'd assume Amazon would be affected by tariffs the same way. Yeah, exactly. Tariffs hit the same products the same way no matter who's selling them. Amazon isn't magically exempt from the same import fees Temu pays. Don't see how this creates any advantage for Amazon at all. This is the thing, once again feels like this hurts Temu, shein, AliExpress more than Amazon.

I feel like this kind of news basically shuts those sites down totally in the USA. Trump suspends exemption for low-value imports under $800…consumers are the ultimate losers here. All retailers are going to raise prices…by how much? We’re going to find out soon enough. It’s going to hurt, everyone needs to buckle up… The thinking is that, 100% of Temu’s products would have tariffs.

Maybe 50% or 70% or 30% of amazons products have tariffs depending on your shopping style.

Even if you are buying something you know originates from China and should have a tariff, you’re still more likely to buy on Amazon because the supplier might’ve brought a shipment onshore before the tariffs hit.

Seems like everyone would’ve just stopped using Temu etc in the USA post tariffs?

Edit: the other part I’ve ignored is also the uncertainty. So you could order today from Temu with a 45% tariff but by the time it arrives at customs the tariff might now be 150%.

1mdm2qx,2025-07-30,"I am confused - Why is this Call oddly priced?
I was looking to do a Covered Call on DUK for 130 for OCT25.   
When I saw the oddly situated ask at 135.. What am I missing. Even the 140 is higher?

  
[Link to image here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K969lzdd4DPADwGYXluq12pcRy4ZmKf-/view?usp=sharing)  



Options markets on individual stocks are very illiquid except for near dated options, around the current price and near major events. 

Notice there is no ask for the 140 call, and volume on all of these is extremely low. 

Basically, the 140 strike call is probably just a (why-not ask) from some HFT. If someone is willing to pay it, they will take it, but otherwise there is just very littler interest. What these tables show for out of the money calls can be deceptive. In addition to needing to look at the chart for recent trades, it's important to know that there can be significant interest in dark pools that simply don't show up on the table. For example, I recently sold hundreds of deep OTM Puts (Jan-16-2026) (not for DUK). According to the tables on Schwab, there was no open interest. FWIW, the premium turned out to be fairly close to what the tables said. Could have been a coincidence. The spread was large. Volume is not that bad on these. 130 oct17 call is $95, and 135 is $47.

RSI is at 57, so there’s some room to get a better price for the call 

Id set a limit order and forget it Option quotes can be funky with illiquid options. Quotes can be stale (the option may have last traded earlier in the day and with underlying price move, a higher strike call can appear to be less expensive than a lower strike call).  

Your time stamp says 4:10 PM.  At the close, traders cancel orders.  That can lead to very wide B-A spreads.  Your $140 call appears to be more expensive than the $135 because the B-A spread on the $135 is still tight, thereby artificially making the midpoint of the $140 call larger.

1mdly7r,2025-07-30,"Help Understanding Google Finance Lists
I have a Google Finance list setup to watch a stock, but I don't understand all the numbers in there.

For context I put in that I purchased X number of this stock on a certain date.  I figure the green number on the top left, 6.51% , is the total return for this stock since purchase.  And the green number on the right, Total Gain 5.67%, is the return for the total portfolio list.  But this is a single stock, single purchase portfolio.  I don't understand why the numbers are close but not identical. What am I missing?

Forgot to mention, the top left number changes with the display range, which makes sense.  But if I put it out to YTD, which covers the point I purchased the stock, the numbers are even more off between the chart and the portfolio number. 

[https://imgur.com/a/TUUSCK7](https://imgur.com/a/TUUSCK7)
If you bought the stock at a different price than the closing price, your value is still the same, but your gains would be different. Good call,  because I manually specified the purchase price. I played around with it and i believe the chart shows the portfolio *value*, while the Portfolio highlights shows the actual *gains*. It's basically a quote chart, multiplied by how many shares you have. Correct, which is why I don't understand why it's not the same. I didn't know if I didn't have something set up correctly or I wasn't understanding how it was displaying the numbers. I'm starting to think that it may just be an oddity in the way the way Google shows the return based on the time filter of the chart. It must not report back to my purchase date exactly. 

For example the purchase date was in May. If I do year-to-date for the range my portfolio it shows a return of 3.72% on the chart.  The actual return is 5.67% over that timeframe.

·        Revenue was $76.4 billion and increased 18% (up 17% in constant currency)

·        Operating income was $34.3 billion and increased 23% (up 22% in constant currency)

·        Diluted earnings per share was $3.65 and increased 24% (up 22% in constant currency)

“Cloud and AI is the driving force of business transformation across every industry and sector,"" said Satya Nadella, chairman and chief executive officer of Microsoft. “We’re innovating across the tech stack to help customers adapt and grow in this new era, and this year, Azure surpassed $75 billion in revenue, up 34 percent, driven by growth across all workloads.”

	Net income increased 24 per cent year on year to $27.2bn, surpassing analysts' expectations for $25.3bn in the three months to the end of June, according to a filing on Wednesday.

Hey guys check out my massive schlong, tell me how good I am please I need it I didn't take it that way.  There's just been a lot of humblebrag posts here and other finance subs lately.

For example, I saw this yesterday in middle class finance (paraphrasing):

""Hey Reddit, I make $350k / year but I only have $1 million invested at 31.  I was wondering if I should be buying quant stocks instead of VOO"" At least 90% of your portfolio should be in a broad fund like S&P, total market, international. 5% can be stuff like gold or some similar type of shit. The other 5% can be speculative like crypto. But if you lose all your speculative money, don't pull from the others. You should consider putting the share price, or the total dollar amount you have in each stock to make it easier for people to give you advice.

At a glance, I would say unless you have some kind of insight into these companies and follow them closely, it might be better to just buy the index (VOO). I think ASTS is speculative at this point. And I say that having done pretty well with it. They may be successful and shoot the moon. Or maybe not. You're off to a decent start with VOO and some GOOG/NVDA, but ASTS and LQDA are speculative and not exactly core holdings. You're young, so dabbling is fine, but don’t mistake gambling for strategy.

I would also recommend going 100% VOO but if you are willing to take a risk, you could do worse, though I wouldn't touch OKLO in your circumstance. Way too speculative and hard to predict that market, even though it's memeing now. That makes sense. Don’t try to understand my logic, I’m new to this so probably just a rookie mistake on my end lol. Do you have any recommendations on how I should have my portfolio? Thank you for the advice! Just buy VOO. Unless you really really really really know what you're looking for, and I'm talking better than Warren Buffett, don't try to buy individual stocks. 

Go watch Common Sense Investing and Plain Bagel videos for a few years to start figuring stuff out. Just buy low fee index funds. 

I would dump it all into VOO with some minimal exposure to hedges. Instead of concentrating into specific stocks you can just leverage up the underlying index with something like TQQQ. You keep the diversification but now take on extra beta due to leverage.

Diversify a little bit with gold and ZROZ but if you have a small account you don’t really need to worry about it too much. You don’t reccomend buying nvidia or other tech stocks outside of VOO? I’m willing to take a risk but I want to make wise choices as well. Should I sell my VIG? Nvidia is 7% of VOO. As is Microsoft. 

Google is 2%. You've already got a lot of those by buying VOO. The point of something like VOO is cheap diversification, which you then undo by doubling down on expensive stocks.

$760 in SPY and NDAQ, $780 in NVDA, $135 in LMT, $190 in RDDT, $505 cash balance +4.68% Open P&L

I make around 300-400 a week and am looking to set myself up for the future. I’m trying not to take many high risk positions. Should I hold everything for now and keep investing in the same stocks? Liquidate some less high performing stocks and keep the cash? Divert to some other stocks because my outlook isn’t great? Any and all suggestions are great as I am not super well versed in this field and am trying to build wealth for the future the right way. 
Just so you know, NDAQ is just the actual exchange. It doesn’t track the nasdaq composite. Need QQQ instead if that’s what you’re trying to do NDAQ is a single company. It's the company that does the NASDAQ 100 (which qqq essentially tries to mimic). 
Qqq is an ETF with 100 companies 
NDAQ is one company A small suggestion, at least make sure to know *what you're buying* before you start. Throwing money blindly at the market is a sure way to lose it all. It doesn't even take 5 seconds of googling to know the difference between Nasdaq the company and Nasdaq the index. Cool. 19 years old! Wish I knew earlier and was like you.

I'd probably start off with a good company and not worry too much so I can sleep.

May I introduce TSMC (Taiwan Semi Conductor) for you to consider. It makes chips for many AI focused companies and their orders are packed for the next couple years.

I am not sure who will win the AI race but I am very confident TSMC is making the chip for the winner.

Best of luck. Cheers. If I were you, I'd just put the money into qqqm or spy/voo. Maybe 90% of it.  And 10% on companies you feel strongly in after doing research. Market goes up, market goes down, market goes up again. You are doing your future self a HUGE service by investing as young as you are. GOOD to see.

1mcuu9h,2025-07-30,"How long did it take you to have confidence in your investment decisions?
So I (35M) just started playing around with trading stocks last week (I have absolutely zero experience whatsoever), and am unsure what I should expect the learning curve to be like?  I'm curious, from the community, roughly how long did it take  you to get the hang of things? For example, should I give up if I can't break even in 6 months? a year? (should I even be thinking about that?) Should I avoid stocks and stick to index/ETFs until I have more capital? So far, I've lost about 3% of my account (its a small 5k account, but does constitute most of my savings lol), and I'm not sure how disappointed/forgiving of myself I should be lol

In a related question (if anyone feels like sharing), I wonder what peoples' general thoughts are about learning this stuff alone, online, from random google searches / social media, vs from coursework, friends, professionals / mentors? I feel a bit rudderless right now doing things on my own tbh, and I wonder what guidance is most practical/efficient. Thanks.
Yes, you should stop trading and stick to broad index funds It only took me a few months to become confident that my decisions are shit. Don't trade stocks with money you aren't ready to lose. 

If you're scared of losing, just buy and hold for 40 years and 85% of the time, you'll win by doing nothing. 

For most people, the sheer amount of time and effort they spent into researching investing, if they put the same effort into say personal relationships or their career or dating, they'll be significantly happier than whatever 2% alpha they generate. It isnt worth it, because you bring no information thats different from the market. You cant ""train to be a trader"". Vast majority fail, and those who do are niche super smart algo quants.

If you need to catch up to some future spending goal, then unfortunately your only way to dial up compensated risk past 100% is leverage, which comes with costs and danger for an emotional person. For example, instead of being 100% VT, you may need to be like 45% SPUU (2x SPY) / 55% ex-US, for 145% equity exposure, something akin to that.

Or utilize short box spreads to buy more stable leveraged instruments like RSSB (100/100 VT/IEF) but 1.5x exposure for 300% exposures to VT and IEF. You should probably start with index ETFs as a solid base, and if you want, give yourself a *small* amount of money to play around with every paycheck. But honestly, the broad research says investing regularly in (and staying invested in) index funds is the best path to building wealth.

Don't be trading in and out every day – that's gambling, not investing. 

Start reading the news (and read broadly) to form your own opinions about what's happening in the world and how that impacts the markets. And there is no real exact timeframe when you'll feel like you've got it all figured out – best to stay humble and remember you're continuing to learn throughout. You could ride a bull market for years only to realize you weren't ready for the first bear market you encounter! I had confidence when I traded a single stock over and over for 18 months until I had made enough for the down payment on my first house. After buying the house, I started again and rode that stock all the way down until the company went bankrupt. Now I put everything in VOO and commercial real estate. keep your 5k as your active portfolio and invest the rest into index funds. If you are a good investor, you should be able to grow you 5k account higher and higher without continuing to contribute to it. If it goes to zero, you should stop. Been a market participant for 24+ years. Been a professional manager for five years. I sleep like a baby but I trust the odds and try to not make decisions myself.

I like to understand what is going on BUT I trust the odds regardless. There’s no argument, especially since you’re starting late. You have so much less time to recover if you lose money- more money than you’ve already lost. 

Most retail traders lose money trading. I would look into r/Bogleheads. It’s not going to be sexy or fun, but long term investments into broad market index funds will be the way to go for 95% of people. Time Traveler: ""I want you to remember this word, okay?

1mcqhal,2025-07-29,"Premise: AI is not a bubble, it's a binary event
The binary event is whether the hundreds of billions or even trillions invested in AI either A) provides a good roic or B) does not provide a good roic.

Companies like meta have been investing massively in AI.  Companies like Nvidia have benefited massively from the capex from companies like meta.

So the premise follows that if meta has been making poor investments they will be punished when it's discovered.  And the discovery that investment into AI offers poor roic means Nvidia will see massive reductions in revenue and margins.

Companies focused on electrification, data center build out, etc have also seen growth and multiple expansion from the AI build out.  That is to say the ramifications of the AI capex spend is far reaching and has large effect on the current earnings and projected growth in the markets beyond Nvidia and meta.

And this premise goes both ways, if hundreds of billions or even trillions invested provides a good roic growth will be massive.  If meta gets a 10% roic on $500B it would add $50B to operating income, nearly doubling their current!

And thus it acts like a binary event.  Thumbs down it could take the market years to achieve the same earnings as today, potentially a lost decade.  Thumbs up and we'll be talking about how cheap these $1-4T valuations were.

Curious on people's thoughts on the matter if they have any.
AI is not binary because AI is not a single investable asset. It's a bubble, bro. It's just like the internet stocks. Internet wasn't a binary event. > So the premise follows that if meta has been making poor investments they will be punished when it's discovered. And the discovery that investment into AI offers poor roic means Nvidia will see massive reductions in revenue and margins.

That sounds a lot like something you could say about any bubble before it bursts. Every bubble happened because the people involved thought there was huge upside and subsequently turned out to have been overly optimistic.

The only difference I see with your analysis is you’re labeling “we don’t know if this time is a bubble or not” as a “binary event”, but that’s just because we live in the present and see past bubbles from the perspective of knowing how they turned out. Isn’t that just a bubble??? Idiot And even if it were, it would have varying positive and negative ROIs depending on the business use case It's a bubble....probably the biggest one ever It's almost exactly like the Dot Com bubble. 

We have a lot of company just throwing ""AI"" on their name without doing anything with AI (or barely doing anything with AI), had a ton of hype around AI, and now we'll get to the weeding out event as more and more investors start asking to see returns on the staggering amount of money companies are paying for AI.

We do have an unhealthy tech space that is much more concentrated than in the Dot Com era, so I would expect that the sorting probably just kicks out a ton of low-lying companies that are just fixing ""AI"" into their titles and keep the massive companies that can actually spend money on this stuff.

But it will be profitable. At the very least, once it can start really doing jobs, I expect companies like Google, Meta, etc, to rent out their AI to companies and make a lot of cash off it. I wish this was chatgpt because at least then it wouldn’t suggest ROIC is a binary. It’s like saying numbers are binary since there are negative and positive ones. Like $1M isn’t better than $50, because they are both positive and not -$1.

Even so, a binary event would allow for a bubble. 

Poorly invested funds in a frenzy is a bubble. The underlying concept can be absolutely sound and have it be a bubble. Like the dotcom bubble. Internet was for real. Companies that added .com to their name because they created a website, and then saw a huge investment are bubbles. Amazon was not. 

Same happened with crypto where some companies added coin or blockchain or crypto to their name and suddenly they rocket off to space. 

Same with AI, plenty of bullshit companies that buy an Anguilla domain and will get investment. A new innovation or technology does not need to be an either/or proposition. Bubble or binary. It is expected that as a new technology appears to be emerging there is a race to create, adopt and integrate. It may or may not work out. Without the investment it won’t be known. There will be winners and losers regardless. There may also be a new dawning of technology. I do understand that there is also the temptation “not to be left behind” so businesses feel obliged to be seen to be pushing the boundaries to compete or stay relevant. This may indeed be wasted capital. Then again the law of unintended consequences applies and also shakes up the old way of doing things to stimulate further assessment or innovation. Will it work? Who knows. Ai certainly is having an impact. The end result will evolve in time. For right now lots of companies are making huge gains that may not be sustainable after the dust has settled. As always each investment should be considered on its own merits. At it's peak the nasdaq 100 was over 200 PE during the dot com boom.

1mcgzh6,2025-07-29,"ChatGPT is amazing for Stock and investment Research
What used to take me hours might take me minutes now with ChatGPT. The caveat is of course \*YOU\* need to be more of an expert because if you aren't you won't know where ChatGPT is wrong or how your questions are the wrong questions.

But if you're very good already, Ai is an amazing time saver. Allow me to illustrate.

I just tore apart Southern Company's investment thesis that Hyperscale Datacenters are driving growth of revenue that justifies 40 year-high multiples.

I'm short SO thinking this isn't true. I was able to grab statistics on datacenters existing, building and planned, in the entire territories of Southern Company. Divide their divisions by power and by natural gas, sort which data centers relied on their own natgas generators (because SO's nat gas provider is not an power plant operator in that way...a data center would have to consume their own nat gas).

I was able to get stats on new MW capacity per subsidiary, and get a percentage of how much of that expansion is Hyperscalers.

For instance Georgia Power's territory is only expanding its MW capacity for hyperscalers by 5%.

And Georgia Power's territory is the LARGEST growth of Hyperscalers into 2027. So 5% growth over 2 more years doesn't seem an amazing reason for 40 year-high multiples.

I think the multiples are related to fear and people are crowding the safe trade for the same reason I'm shorting the SPY and oil.

  
But I also short SO because I understand THEIR business and understand it's overpriced, and that ""safe havens"" don't exist. In a market crash, SO will go in the toilet with everything else.

But I was able to pull a ton of information, cross reference it, and source it with Ai. An amazing tool if you know how to use it and know how to avoid all its problems.
In just minutes you can falsely confirm all of your assumptions and biases! How useful!


As a bonus, you'll even be told how sharp and insightful you are 🙃 Nice try, ChatGPT. It’s good for webscraping faster than I can browse, but that’s it Good bot.

1mc0rwd,2025-07-29,"Curious what do you all think about cloudflare (NET)
I like cloudflare as a product. I also worked with some engineers from there and generally believe they have excellent talent, excellent execution and excellent product. Their free product is something that would cost you few thousands dollars on AWS or Azure. Their paid product is pretty much unmatched except for companies with extremely deep pockets. 

The scale of the company, the amount of public internet traffic that flows through them is mind boggling. They have positioned themselves to benefit from any internet wide phenomenon at a pace that no other company can match. Case in point, blocking/charging AI bots. It’s the current fad, sure, and many other services sprung up to deal with that. However, all the big websites are already using cloudflare, and Cloudflare upsell is how they run their business. Which brings me to the second point; how cloudflare runs their business.


As I mentioned Cloudflare has a free tier that’s insanely generous. Their paid plan is also ridiculously cheap. It’s a no-brainer for any business to get a couple of niceties but it’s also clearly a loss leader. They make all their money analyzing those users usage patterns and calling up those companies to upsell them on other various (often significantly more expensive) services cloudflare offers. They go through cycles of firing all their sales teams, working on products, then hiring a sales team to sell them to their biggest clients, rinse and repeat. I can easily imagine the amount of calls and contracts they can very easily close with a “Just click that button and you’ll block (or get paid by) AI bots”

The ugly part is their financials. They are not a young company (15 years old), but they have also never turned a profit. They have 50% their revenue YoY 18-22, though slowed down to 34% and 28% for 2023-2024. All of their cash flow is diluted by their employees and CEO stock options. 

I was watching it on IPO back in 2019 and remember thinking I’ll wait until they turn a profit. Then I decided to get into 10k in Jan of 2021 ($72 cost basis) thinking I’ll just buy it and forget it. 4 years later and still no profits. I’m up significantly of course. I wanna think that this has no way to go but up in 10 or 20 years. But I keep reminding myself that the company is already 15 years old. I’m waiting for the earnings call this week. Expecting (hoping for?) a significant revenue jump, but not expecting profits sadly. 


My biggest worry is not fully knowing how big that moat I mentioned is. It’s not rocket science to replicate, so not Nvidia, TSMC, ASML type moat. It’s more about the execution and logistics. Microsoft, Amazon, Google cloud drop a Cloudflare competitor yesterday. In fact they all have various “close enough” offerings that are just insanely expensive because they don’t operate anywhere near the efficiency of Cloudflare in that domain. 
Cloudflare is a great company, but I don't think it is a great stock. I like the company, but I would wait them becoming profitable.

Promise of edge computing hasn't really materialized, local computing is cheaper, colocated computing performs better.

Cloudflare cannot grow margins with just CDN and network services, so they need this edge computing, but I don't see it happening in large scale. Been holding for a few years and very happy about that. Wouldn’t add at these levels, but that’s as much to do with the general market as $NET. I haven’t researched them…in your opinion, why haven’t they been profitable in 15 yrs? Personally I think they are shaping up to explode higher in the next few years and am buying more. I’m a software dev and their products are amazing. Investors aren’t technical though so don’t really understand them but us devs sure do. I think I’m arriving at the same conclusion It doesn’t really matter how awesome the company is from a technical prospective when it comes to investing. As a consumer or a user, I love companies that waste their investors money to subsidize my stuff. Burn it all until you go bankrupt and I’ll just move to another company. As an investor though, I avoid those companies. Well it does matter because the technical underpinnings are what makes the products great. You don't understand Cloudflare's products so yeah, don't invest in it. Cloudflare isn't burning investor cash, they haven't raised anything since the IPO. How do you think they can post losses every quarter and still keep going? How do you think public companies raise funds exactly? They doubled their debt and the number of outstanding shares since 2021. That’s how they raise funds. They take on debt and issue shares. If CloudFlare needs $100M, they can print ($100M/current share price), and now they have raised $100M. Going from 146 million shares to 341 million shares at ~$80 a share that’s is raising 15B since their IPO through their stocks, i.e investor money. They have also doubled their debt. You don’t understand how business works, why invest? It’s just gambling at a certain point.

I have over 10k in my bank account just sitting there and feel like it’s time to start investing my money. I’ve looked into SPYs and other stocks like nvidia and Tesla (tech) and want to know what would be the best plan of action for someone like me. Average in on my price and buy certain amounts? Also what percentages should be invested into companies like nvidia and Tesla and apple and which should be invested in spy’s and qqq? I’m sorry if this ain’t allowed just feel like I’m just losing time , I know I’m not going to become a billionaire over night but want to get things rolling. 
If you don't know anything about accounting, forget about buying individual stocks and focus on ETFs if you're looking to invest your savings, it's good to start with a solid plan. consider diversifying your investments to spread the risk. stocks, bonds, and even some real estate can be good options depending on your risk tolerance. also, keeping an eye on market sentiment can help inform your decisions. i built a tool called the Trump Market Index that tracks how Trump's statements affect market feelings. it might give you some insights as you decide where to put your money. just remember to do your research and maybe consult a financial advisor too. good luck! If it's part of QQQ and doesn't outperform it (eg. Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple) then just buy QQQ instead.

If it outperforms QQQ even if it's a component of it then it may be worth buying some shares (eg. Nvidia).

I'd say keep 40-60% of your portfolio in QQQ. Pick other ETFs and stocks for the rest. If it isn't outperforming QQQ then you better get something good in return from it, for example international diversification like EWN and DXJ.",2,0.75,4,0,NiteZTV,investing,['SPY'],plans investment money savings 10k bank account sitting feel like time start investing money ive looked spys stocks like nvidia tesla tech want know would best plan action someone like average price buy certain amounts also percentages invested companies like nvidia tesla apple invested spys qqq im sorry aint allowed feel like im losing time know im going become billionaire night want get things rolling dont know anything accounting forget buying individual stocks focus etfs youre looking invest savings good start solid plan consider diversifying investments spread risk stocks bonds even real estate good options depending risk tolerance also keeping eye market sentiment help inform decisions built tool called trump market index tracks trumps statements affect market feelings might give insights decide put money remember research maybe consult financial advisor good luck part qqq doesnt outperform eg microsoft amazon google apple buy qqq instead outperforms qqq even component may worth buying shares eg nvidia id say keep 4060 portfolio qqq pick etfs stocks rest isnt outperforming qqq better get something good return example international diversification like ewn dxj
1mbnqxx,2025-07-28,"Stoicism in Investing and the Importance of Portfolio Rebalancing
Let me preface by saying everything below is for folks investing in individual stocks/trying to generate excess return and learn about markets - if you’ve got a set it and forget it in index funds, that’s the right call for most people and this post isn’t for you.

Decided to post again on moves I’m making / have already made with my portfolio starting last week and extending for the next couple weeks through earnings. I’ve gotten some positive feedback / requests from newer/younger investors to provide my investment perspectives, so posting this in the hopes it helps some folks build a mental model for how to think about markets and hopefully not to get run over (avoiding big losses is as, if not more important than making big gains in investing). I studied Classics as well as Economics in college, and am always reminded when investing of the importance of stoicism (or in market parlance, mean reversion). Things are almost never as good or as dire as they seem and knowing this influences how I think about markets and how I look to profit through changes in sentiment and market cycles.

First, it’s critical to understand this isn’t a doomsday post but rather it’s important as individual investors to understand market sentiment. In the words of Warren Buffet “be fearful when others are greedy.” Not recommending anyone dump their whole portfolio tomorrow or enter a costly short position, but given we’ve had a 26% run up in 3 months (and much more in certain AI stocks), it’s time to start thinking about taking profits on positions that have materially run up and getting out of positions where valuations are insanely stretched (e.g, if you’re in PLTR, TSLA, Cloud Flare, etc). I’m personally exiting a number of positions and increasing my cash position to ~20-30%.

Positions I’m trimming/exiting:
AMD (out)
BTC (trimmed to <2% of portfolio)
Uber (waiting on earnings to trim/exit)
Draft Kings (waiting on earnings to trim)
CEG (out)
Google (still very long, holding core position but selling my long-dated options over the next few weeks as we hopefully bleed up toward $200 post a very strong earnings quarter - was my single biggest position).

Simple reasons behind this portfolio rebalancing:
1. Several AI stocks I invested in back/before April have run up materially and now are a larger portion of my overall portfolio (increasing portfolio volatility and risk). Have to recognize many of these stocks are priced at or near perfection at this point. It wouldn’t be shocking to see some air come out of this balloon in the short term, though I do believe in the longer term trend.
2. September historically is the worst performing month for the S&P, coupled with the fact that we’re starting to see peak euphoria tendencies (meme stock rallies, wild IPO rides, huge option bets by retail investors who have limited to no experience), spells for me time to reduce my risk.
3. The market right now is priced for the rosiest of scenarios. It seems to believe the economy will remain resilient AND rates will be cut ~2 times this year. I think one of these is likely to be true, but these scenarios are likely to be mutually exclusive, I.e, economy stays resilient and Powell keeps rates steady or economy starts to falter and we see the cuts, either way we surprise to the downside vs expectations. The market is also heavily weighted to the AI trade and is now above 30x earnings (average is closer to 22x the past 30 years)
4. I think the impacts of tariffs haven’t played out in the economic data yet (there’s a lag on these policies as they’re enacted, enforced, and inventory clears) and wouldn’t shock me to see some prints in the fall that start to rattle markets (given where we’re at now from a historical P/E perspective it won’t take much). I don’t think it’s Aug 1 that’ll send us but some higher CPI / lower consumer spending/confidence prints in the early fall that spell weakening economy or rate cuts being off the table.

This is all to say, at a market level, we’ve hit euphoria and I believe the balance of risk is now skewed to the down side. As a long-term investor, I’m always long the market but to different degrees, but for all these reasons, I’m trimming my nosebleed valuation stocks, adding to those with more reasonable valuations, and building a cash position. If we get a 5-10%+ dip (which I think is reasonable given the markets sensitivity to a 50 bps change in rate expectations), I’ll start layering into select positions again. As always, these are my views, not investment advice. Good luck out there!

One way or other at the end of the day this is still a  justification in trying to time the market.  
As per Buffet and Munger ideally you want to buy stocks to hold forever.  
But of course we all need money to spend so your point of cashing out on a run up is good , IF you need the money.  
If you are going to turn around and invest again then it’s timing again.  
Historical data says people are worse off who stay on the sidelines.  
Above is for well researched stocks and ones you believe in the long term. Have you looked at Berkshires holdings? They’ve doubled their cash position in the past year and have been selling down their financials positions in BofA, Citi, Cap One, and others precisely because multiples are running so hot in the financials sector.  If you’re going to just buy and hold an index fund, fine, but if you’re playing individual equities with concentrated positions and trying to generate alpha (like Buffett) you need to have a sense for when to rotate out when the fundamentals no longer justify the price, and the move is to cash while you look for new investment opps I could be wrong but what you're describing is a change in strategy, or more negatively, panicking. From what I understand, rebalancing means trying to return to your original strategy, because the waitings in your account have gotten out of whack. 

But if you're wanting to take investments off the table to have cash, and just sit on it, you're just getting nervous. Learn to read historical performance page, compare to benchmark. You’re likely just justifying panic selling with “rebalancing”. Best of luck. I think you're right in your thinking, however maybe lean towards taking some profits(trim) on most stocks you believe are going into oversold territory, unless something changes in your theiesis of a particular company, at which point you may want to sell all your holdings. This way you still have holdings in companies that continue to rise, and you protect major losses by taking profits. I never said buy and hold index fund. I believe in holding good stocks like Amazon for 30 years to get great returns, I have done it my self. You don’t get that return by trying to time the market. Not really, cash is an asset and at current rates yields over 4%. I think it’s healthy to maintain some level of cash (5-10%) and have been fully invested since April so in many ways, it’s restoring that position and  going a bit overweighting. As I stated I’m also looking for opportunities to redeploy into more reasonably priced stocks but those have been fewer and further between. Trimming massive winners over a 3 month rally is not panicking its prudent risk management. I should specify this is for people want to actively manage their portfolio and think about markets. If you’ve got a set it and forget it strategy, god bless I think that’s appropriate for most people.",0,0.5,7,0,InternationalTop4495,investing,"['TSLA', 'GOOGL']",stoicism investing importance

1max2ws,2025-07-27,"Investing in Magnificent 10 or so?
A lot has been written that the magnificent 7 are the source of most of th4e SP500 gains, so I was wondering if there was an ETF that invests in just those, and - of course - there is: $MAGS.

Then I looked at the hldings, and - of course - as expected: https://i.imgur.com/LPVeJyG.png

And then I thought: what if I were to tweak it:

* remove problem children like $TSLA and and $AAPL for instance
* expand it to include $AVGO, $TSM, $JPM, $V https://i.imgur.com/hu1ypBh.png 

It could be easily implemented with Fidelity's Basket Portfolio.

Is anyone else doing something similar? What are your ins/outs? How is it working for you?
Why stop there? 

I think it's a great idea but maybe expand it out to maybe magnificent 500 IShares has their market-cap TOPT (top 20 S&P stocks) or QTOP (top 30 QQQ stocks) for 0.2% ER.  

They also have a longer run OEF US S&P 100 (the top 100 US stocks) which has good long term # again for 0.2%. Go to r/dividends people do it all the time.  They just buy them and hold them.  With index fund you don't just get the good.  You also get bad or stagnant companies. So index funds have gains and dividends.  So by picking a limited number of good socks you can get better grow or dividends or both.  And if you hold long enough you could see significant gains Not a bad suggestion, and it could go 2 ways:

1. The Magnificent of the SP500
2. The top Magnificent 500 companies

Too bad that Fidelity Basket's limit is 30 securities. Quite interesting, thank you.

> QEF US S&P 100

I believe it's OEF (O, not Q). I already have $PLTR in a separate allocation of my portfolio.

Interestingly enough, it's at #21 by market cap; so it could make the Magnificent 20. I don't understand why that's a problem. VTSAX or FIAX (I think that's the ticket) both give you s&p 500 exposure. 🫡 Pltr",3,0.64,9,0,G4M35,investing,"['AAPL', 'TSLA', 'JPM']",investing magnificent 10 lot written magnificent 7 source th4e sp500 gains wondering etf invests course mags looked hldings course expected thought tweak remove problem children like tsla aapl instance expand include avgo tsm jpm v could easily implemented fidelitys basket portfolio anyone else something similar insouts working stop think great idea maybe expand maybe magnificent 500 ishares marketcap topt top 20 sp stocks qtop top 30 qqq stocks 02 er also longer run oef us sp 100 top 100 us stocks good long term 02 go rdividends people time buy hold index fund dont get good also get bad stagnant companies index funds gains dividends picking limited number good socks get better grow dividends hold long enough could see significant gains bad suggestion could go 2 ways 1 magnificent sp500 2 top magnificent 500 companies bad fidelity baskets limit 30 securities quite interesting thank qef us sp 100 believe oef q already pltr separate allocation portfolio interestingly enough 21 market cap could make magnificent 20 dont understand thats problem vtsax fiax think thats ticket give sp 500 exposure pltr

Hey guys, 

Multiple questions here

I’ve been investing for a while now, mostly in safe stocks like GOOG, NVDA and AMZN for long term with moderate knowledge, mostly long term.

I’m looking to expand my knowledge so investing can be my sideline and maybe my main income in maybe 10 years. Would love to learn calls, short squeeze and research companies. I love to learn but I’m not much of a reader.

1- How do you guys do your DD mostly ? 

2- I know it’s pretty impossible to predict how a stock will go. But like how did you guys find out about PLTR at 15$, GRRR at 4$ or RKLB at 7$ ?

3- do you guys use AI in any way to help you trade ? If so which one and how ? 

4- which YouTube channel or podcast do you guys watch or listen to improve ? 

5- any tools or website to recommend me, free or not, to improve ?

Thanks a lot!! 
Schwab & ToS have good tools. Schwab aggregates a lot of reports too. 

AI just scrapes the internet, it's just going to spit out reddit opinions Those stocks aren't particularly safe, you're just performance chasing which is a guaranteed way to *underperform* over time. You're buying high... Better stick to ETFs if that's your knowledge level.


1. This is incredibly basic stuff. Read the sidebar, read some books or at worse look up some actual tutorials from educated professionals (not influencers) on YouTube. Start by reading the investors page for stocks and their financial documents.



2. Reddit is good, as is twitter. You'll see 1 good stock out of 100 000 pumped bad ones. You'll get fooled big time and lose your money so hard. You'll see bagholders pumping shit and the ones that might get big is *the ones you'll not invest in because they seem to be losers at the time of writing*. You'll litterary know what's good and winner soon bad, that's why they're cheap..



3. The current AI models litterary *can't do stock analysis*. They can't, thats not how they're programmed. What they can do is, at best, summarise said economical reports for you to make it easier to do DD. But asking ChatGPT for stock advice is like asking the local crackhead...


4. None. Anything you see is *old and dated* this any stock advice is useless. Theoretical knowledge and hard facts are okay but there's simply too many scam artists since no one checks credentials. Read a book, get smart.



5. Not really. Investing is litterary buying VOO and chill. Trading/individual stocks is a *full time job done by the world's best professionals* and your trying to beat them, you might as well start jogging and challenge Usaine Bolt. The odds are astronomical that you'll underperform. Your only reasonable chance at winning is *pure luck* and there's no guide to luck. If you want to learn there is no *quick way to succeed, just hard work*. A basic econ degree is at least 3 years if full time studies...good luck! This appears to be a DD submission.

Hi, everyone!

I’m a 22 years old from Spain just starting to invest, I’d say around 350 USD per month, in order to create a good portfolio in the long term. This is how it’s looking right now. Any feedback you could share? Of course it’s not that diversified just yet, but I’m working toward that goal. Next month I’m planning to add Visa, Apple, and I’ll start adding AUM5 (Amundi S&P 500ETF) gradually along individual stocks to ballance risk a little bit. Also, let’s see how UNH’s EC goes.

Thank you!
Maybe some etf that tracks international market (like iusq for example) ? I would recommend DCA'ing into a low cost index fund that tracks the S&P 500 and not bother with individual stocks right now (You're planing to buy Apple which is already pretty high weighted in the Amundi S&P500 ETF). Spend some of your time reading and understanding some fundamentals about investing.


That way you avoid costly mistakes early on (you're young so every dollar you lose from an early investing mistake wont compound for you in the future). 


Over time you can allocate about 10-20% of your portfolio into special situations where you have relative high conviction that they will work out (convicition that you'll gain by understanding the fundamentals). 


Just my 2 cents. Consider adding some international stocks for more diversification in your portfolio. Thanks!

1m9ef9y,2025-07-25,"Saving for bigger home in the next 1-2 years need investing/allocation advice
As the title says wife and I have our starter home we bought in 2018. Low mortgage with okay rate. Life has changed in those 7 years we’ve added 2 children and would like to get into a bigger home that can be forever. Our current home can’t be added onto due to lot and dimension limitations. Ideally would like to keep this home rent it out and purchase a new home once we have enough saved. Currently have about 75k in hysa and another like 25k invested in VOO and NVDA. Also have 529 for the kids. How should I allocate the 75k to help grow the down payment savings? 
Easy answer is that houses won't become more affordable. Given a time frame of 1-2 years you should only invest in a HYSA or bonds. Anything with ETFs, stocks or particularly crypto means *you stand a good chance to lose between 30-100% of your money* within this time frame. Thank you for this response! I do have a small side business to generate extra money. I agree that the timeframe is short and the small gains  in the market probably don’t justify the risks. It’s 208k left. I hadn’t checked the app in a while lol. This is actually a really challenging question. Depends on risk tolerance. 

Options:
1. Hysa maintaining value 
2. You think market is overvalued buy gold and reits
3. You look for undervalued stocks
4. You vti or mgk and chill
5. Go bitcoin crazy
6. You start a small business 
7. You buy a small business 
8. You get into options or futures
9. You flip something you know how to sell
10. Add side gig

What is your risk level? Taking out money in 2 years usually suggests that you should just hysa and add to it. Yeah I mean that’s what I’ve been doing but then there’s part of me that feels like I’m missing out on earning potential especially if our timeline becomes a bit ambiguous as we don’t really know when houses will become more affordable. But yeah I’m pretty much with you. No lies detected. We have a lot of equity in our home and it has doubled in value. I think I’m just making things more difficult with this aggressive plan to try to keep our current property as a rental since our mortgage is so low with can net around $800 based on the going rent in our area. Without this rental piece we would be good to buy tomorrow. But I’m thinking about wealth down the line. Most likely yes, as this wouldn’t derail my life. We are comfortable as is. The new home is a want not a need. So I do think if we lost we would simply be able to wait it out longer to come back. I think the question is more so the degree of risk.

1m9b41j,2025-07-25,"should i convert single stocks into qqq?
looking over old portfolio stuff. hadn't glanced at it in a spell. saw there was a little vz (less than 100 shares) and tsla (less than 50)

vz operates on lots of debt in spite of a decent dividend. TSLA isn't the company i thought it was. interested in getting out. 

thoughts on selling and turning it into QQQ? thank you


Go for it.

Just remember to save some of it for long term capital gains tax. I got out of my Tesla & VZ like 2 months ago, rolled  it over to my VGT & FSELX ETF's. I have a bunch of  QQQ I can't imagine getting out of anytime soon. I say do it! VZ if the dividend isn't compelling you to keep it, go ahead and sell.  I had a lot of VZ at one time but the div eventually wasn't enough to keep me in it.

TLSA who knows, if you're not underwater on it, I'd possibly look at that as a lottery ticket.  Depends on what the size of your total portoflio is.  If TSLA's like 2% or less I'd at least think about keeping it unless you really hate it. Why QQQ?  Why do you think the top 100 companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange are currently undervalued? Thank you for taking a moment to respond. 

The consideration to get rid of vz is based on the stock really not doing anything for years, and that they operate under massive debt, and third it's a single stock.

my understanding, ist single stocks are often not the way to go for people trying to play it safer. I passively agreed to vz under the advisement of a professional a while ago. 

TSLA I thought had some good ideas a few years ago (pre COVID) but this year has really made me reconsider all that. 

QQQ just seems a safer, long term etf that may not have the giant swings but is a collection of companies that will do well over the next two decades.

1m9a4dc,2025-07-25,"Investing Advice For A 38 YO Healthcare Business Consultant.
I would like advice on how to approach investing for someone around my age group (38 years old). I currently have some money set aside in my checking and also in my 401K and I have been anxious to make recurring income using monthly options ETFs like QQQI, SPYI, GPIQ and GPIX. However, it seems like in that decision I also sacrifice growth for income and gives a lot of headache with taxes. My career in Healthcare Consulting is pretty stable (so far lol) and I want to take advantage and Invest the right way in order to balance both reoccurring income and money appreciation. 

In your opinion, what is the best approach to balance both growth but also recurring income that DRIPs over time? Would love to see examples of portfolio breakdowns. 

Have you ever experienced a similar scenario and what did you decide to do? 
Thanks a lot! Very helpful! You can do this but you need to have a budget for the risky moves you make. Majority of your money should be invested in multiple areas. If you don't have time or mentality for growth/value investing then get someone to help you as it was mentioned. Some people just vti and chill. If you enjoy researching companies and building yourself then that is a different conversation. Find a hire a trusted pro. You shouldn’t be managing money, this is no insult. You’re too young to be focused on income. 

Investing right is buying VOO on an automatic weekly basis and only selling when you have something urgent to pay for. 

But you sound like you have the wrong temperament. You will panic sell. Again, no insult here. But you need help. Open a Fidelity account. Have several consultations with their advisors. You can start with what I told you though. Best of luck. If you’re going to do a robo advisor, just weekly buy VOO.

You want income, and you think VOO is boring? Goodness you don’t realize how little you know. Income strategies are the soccer mom mini van of investing brother. 

If you make good money, just find and hire a pro. Most suck, but if you find a good one, they make all the difference. Best of luck. I agree with VOO but it seems too slow and boring haha.

1m95udb,2025-07-25,"You Can Time the Market even though you can't know what the market will do
Yes, this is actually true. I think people get it very wrong when they say ""you can't time the market"".

  
What you can not do is take out a bunch of calls at all time highs and expect to win. Or buy puts when the market crashes 20% in a week (April 2025) and expect to win.

That kind of market prediction is ***GAMBLING*** and will blow up your account.

How a professional times the market is by building positions that work in different ***SCENARIOS*** and then closing those positions when they ""work out"", which Warren Buffett called, workouts.

Right now I have positions that:

1. Go up if the market goes up.
2. Goes up if the market goes down
3. Goes up if Bonds go higher
4. Goes up if Dollar, gold, bitcoin, yatta yatta.

Before the last few months I had a lot more diversity of positions. I had longed gold, longed bonds, longed MSFT, NVDA, (Ai), etc. all at different times.

When NVDA crashed, I bought it.

When it rallied, I sold it.

The point is that to time the market isn't because you're exactly right about time, price and direction.

Timing the market is about being able to survive multiple outcomes, defending or cutting losers (defend if the investment makes sense, sell if the investment thesis changes); and selling your winners or let them ride.

What doesn't work?

Making an exact prediction that makes-or-breaks your portfolio (blows up your account).

What also doesn't work?

Buy and hold with DCA at regular intervals (the usual ""Can't time the market crowd"").

Those people will get a market average and probably not even a very good one because the market is near highs 80% of the time. So you'd get a high cost basis.

Timing the market requires a little patience, good breadth of strategy, and some common sense. And that's it.
Well boys… pack it up. He solved it, dollar cost averaging bad, market timing good. >Right now I have positions that:

>Go up if the market goes up.

>Goes up if the market goes down

It also means you have positions that go down if the market goes up and it goes down if the market goes down. [deleted] This sounds like an excellent strategy to underperform the market. Nope. You are wrong. We have decades of research that shows that for the vast majority of people and institutions time in the market is superior to timing the market.

Are you one of the few that can properly time the market? Maybe. Can you do it for 40 years? Probably not. No no no. You dollar cost average *while* timing the market You don't. time anything you just adjust your exposure Isn't this just making OCO orders? You’re not going to find much support for “actually you can time the market” takes around here, but hope it works out for you.

1m92if3,2025-07-25,"I debunked the Golden Cross (20 years on S&P 500)
The media often talk about the Golden cross and Death cross.

I tested it on SPY over the last 20 years. **It's a very unreliable signal for long-term overperformance.**

**Here are the results :** [**https://imgur.com/a/Cz8WUfS**](https://imgur.com/a/Cz8WUfS)

The strategy rules were:

* Buy when there is a golden cross on the daily chart
* Sell when there is a death cross

If it underperformed big time on the SPY, which has been trending up very well over the last 2 decades, then I can't imagine how useless it would be on other assets that haven't trended as clearly as SPY.
That’s because it reflects past price action… not the future. Yes it often eats a lot of the downturn and misses a lot of the recovery so it’s bad in rapid swings but pretty good on steady trends (up or down).

But you need to show what buying and holding would do in the same timeframe.

Edit: I found an old summary I made just looking at charts, the golden/death cross strategy:

* Lost money in the July 1998 drop (sold low to buy high)
* Made money in Aug 2000 by selling then and rebuying around June 2003 - missed a 3 year drop full of fake pumps and dead cat bounces that lasted years
   * caveat: did not assume money in MMFs/bonds/HYSA, dividends missed or continuously buying the **3 year** dip
   * the practicality and whether it's realistic to hold cash equivalent for 3 years is unknown
* Made money in a drop around Jan 2008, and rebuying around Jul 2009 - missed a massive drop
* Neutral in 1/1/2009-1/1/2018, holding throughout all dips would likely be more beneficial
* Lost some money in the \~Jan 2019 dip (crash?) by missing the dip but buying higher
* Lost money in the covid-19 dip by, again, missing the dip buy buying higher
* Made some little money in 2022 by getting out early and high (by luck? Mar 2022) and rebuying fairly low in Feb 2023

So based on my very crude ""analysis"", no numbers associated with it, just plotting the crosses and looking at the rough sell and buy prices it looks like the golden/death cross strategy is neutral at best. It predicts the past, not the future This is like saying you proved astrology wrong.  No shit.  Technical analysis is complete voodoo bullshit. Sounds great though Shouldn't the cross strategy be the opposite? Death cross means oversold so buy, golden cross means overbought so sell. What? I’m confused.

1m92gvx,2025-07-25,"Run your own Hedge Fund / Family Office!
Sorry for the click-bait(ish) title, but this is something that I have been thinking for a while, and I wanted to share with the community.

My story: I am old. Really, LOL on me, I know.

I grew up poor AF in generational poverty, in a hell hole of a place too. And, ever since I was a kid, I was exposed to both well educated people and rich people as well. And while I was in awe with the educated people, I hated being poor, and I wanted to be financially stable one day.

Fast forward to today, I put myself through college, first one of my expended family and friends to do so, and the overachiever me got 1 BS and 1 MBA, where I also took classes in finance/investing (one of my papers was in binomial derivatives).  All along I also studied on my own personal finances and investing. I still remember my very first investment, I lost $200 in a sure bet stock!  LOL

The core:

I ran my personal finances like running a company: revenue, OpEx, and CapEx.  No matter how poor I was I always lived within my means and I did not fall for the easy consumer credit. Fuck that.

I live in NYC and I still live very frugally, and manage to have fun to on a small budget. And I save what I feel it's a lot of money (remember, I grew up poor AF).

I run my portfolio like a hedge fund, or a Family Office if you will.

And I take the easy/lazy road, that, unbeknown to Social Media and Reddit, often use a simple trick to ""beat"" the market: they invest in the SP500 and *tweak* the returns with some easy minor positions, either shorting the dogs (puts), and boosting the winners (stocks / calls) and pimping their positions by writing calls.

I took my inspiration from them:

1. The vast majority of my portfolio is in QQQ / SPY
2. I have a minority of my portfolio that I have allocated to AI *at large*, MSFT is the largest holding there
3. I have a minority portion of my portfolio that I have allocated to Quantum stocks.
4. I have a minority portion of my portfolio that I have allocated to ""Disruptive Technologies""
5. I have a minority portion of my portfolio that I have allocated to wild cards.
6. Note:
 * 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 above represent <10% of my portfolio cost basis,
 * and I don't rebalance
 * I make monthly buys across all positions religiously on the first day of the month. I accumulate positions, I rarely take a position with a single transaction.
 * I never take money out of my portfolio
7. And yes, wife and I max out on 401K plans at work, invested in SPY. It's all part of the ""portfolio""

I track my NetWorth using Empower, and I track my future cash flow with a simple spreadsheet. My finances are easy: 1 checking account, 4 credit cards (2% cash back citi for personal 2% cash back fidelity for business, 5% cash back CHASe for amazon, 6% cash back AMEX for groceries) that I pay off at the end of the month, all payments are auto-pay to my credit cards or to my checking account.


So, that's my hedge fund. And IMO it's the correct way to look at it.


My advise to you is:

1. Live within your means, paying interest on consumer credit to buy things you don't ned with money you don't have, to impress people you don't like is silly. And if you're broke, there's no investment what will take your negative net worth and make you ""rich"". That's how people fall for scams.
2. Get an education on investing, if it's not your thing just do the BogleHeads way https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio , but if you get a good investment education, your own Hedge Fund can do miracles with your hard earned savings.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
This is a funny way to pretend you’re a hedge fund manager but happy for you bro LOL. I know I am not a hedge fund manager, but for my own personal  portfolio I think that way.

And I am not a political commentator of facebook, or a food critic on yelp, or a cultural agent of change on Instagram either. called barbell start. cheers Just semantics:

In order to be a ""family office"" you need to have a corporation. 

In order to be a ""fund"" there needs to be capital contributions from individuals that aren't related.

A hedge fund is a type of fund that caters only to qualified and accredited investors. 

There are plenty of ""hedge funds"" that have under $10M in assets. And there are plenty of ""retail investors"" that have more than $100M in assets.

The goal of family offices and *most* large hedge funds is not primarily returns but to dampen volatility and to beat inflation.

1m8lphq,2025-07-25,"Where to begin investing in individual stocks?
Hi everyone,

My wife and I (30s) plan on transferring 120k into a brokerage account with hopes of letting it grow. We’ve been investing VOO in our ROTH IRA for years now, but we decided that we also want to begin investing outside of that as well as our money wasn’t growing much sitting in a HYSA

We plan on doing a majority in VOO, but maybe put 30k into different individual stocks. Any recommendations on the growth potential for Google, NVIDIA, amazon, etc?

It’s always a question as to when to enter the market as it’s difficult seeing a high without fully knowing the overall growth potential for these markets

With that said, meta at one point was 400 where people thought it wouldn’t grow more, but alas it’s at 700 now.

Any good value individual stocks to bet on for long term to appreciate a good gain?

What’s everyone’s thoughts on UNH, QS, SOUN, RKLB, or ABAT? Any potential for large growth in the future if we look to hold at least 5 years?
1. All of those are already in VOO. 

2. International diversification is extremely important too.

3. Stock picking is very likely to provide a significantly lower rate of return. Pick your 3 favorite products. The ones you recommend to you friends and family. Buy those companies Bro is not Peter lynch😭😭 I would not listen to this reply it can be interrupted too literally. When replying to people you need to explain yourself a bit clearer, simply saying pick your favourite products isn’t productive. What happens for example he likes some electronic product but the company has rising and debt and horrible earnings aswell as slow sales consecutively? You need to include a lot more in your sentences. Because statistically it’s true. Yes you can have outsized wins if you pick right but statistically for most people you’re more likely to underperform the market than over perform it in individual stocks simply because predicting the future is hard and seeing WERE the growth is coming from is hard. You might pick a good company that grows 9% but because it wasn’t one of the BEST 5 you missed out on an 11% market gain and shed 2% in value. Never just listen to news or friends to pick stocks. If it was that easy, everyone would have been making money. I would suggest understand the company thoroughly. What are their competitors? What are the industry they are in? How much moat they have? What are their financials? What are their products?

For fundamentals, you can check Yahoo Finance or https://myfinsight.com/ I used Core and Satellite investment. My core investment is in S&P 500 on 401k, QQQ 33.3%/SCHG 33.3%/SPMO 33.3% on brokerage account, IBIT 50%/ETHA 50% on IRA.

Satellite investments are individual stocks. Each stocks doesn't go over more than 5% of my over all brokerage account portfolio. I only invest in stocks that I use ever day, literally: PG, PEP, KO, CALM, COST, WMT, MSFT, GOOG, AAPL, NFLX, RSG, ....

I invest on individual stocks for more concentration on stocks I believe in. Yes you are investing in those stocks in index funds but its only a concentration of 2%-3% on index funds. Everyone loved peloton in 2020. They hardly exist now 1. Which ""liberation day""? Trump called his Inauguration January 20nd that and then went and used the same phrase again with his tariff announcement August 2nd before the market went into free fall. At what point would you buy?

2. I believe the Efficient Market Hypothesis is correct more often than not. There are thousands of experts and billions of dollars being spent every day to try to ""beat the market"" I find any individual's odds of beating the system to be quite low especially without serious time commitment. 

3. Single asset or single stock investing often comes with uncompensated risk. Aka additional risk without an additional expected return. 

If you've successfully stock picked and won, I'm excited for you! I hope it goes great, and I genuinely wish you success. For most people, it won't work out that way. It's really easy to look backward and find the stocks you *should have* invested in to make money. But you can't invest in the past. It's a lot harder to find the winner stocks in the future.

1m8i73d,2025-07-24,"Criticism welcome on my 4k investing
I have been using this investing strategy for a few years. I'm in my early 30's. Welcome to any constructive criticism or adjustments I should make. I invest and save minimum of $4,000 a month. Breakdown of that is..

$1,500 for $75 daily market buy of $35 VOO, the other $40 is split between SPMO, SCHB, SCHD, SCHF, and SPYD

$1,000 for my 401k

$580 monthly contribution into Roth IRA

$500 split between 6 CD accounts, each mature 2 months apart. Renewing/ making news ones and rolling over the funds.

$420 goes into SGOV. I use this as a ""warchest"" fund when the market dips. Like they did in April 2025. I'm not lucky enough to time pulling out, before the market will dips. I just buy heavy when they are.

  
Edit: Everything is set on auto deposit and investing. 
One day you'll get the hang of it and take a more relaxed approaching.

Max your 401k.

Max your IRA.

Everything else into your brokerage.

All in VTI, or S&P 500, or equivalent. That's it. There's no need to sit there and plan out daily dollar investing and all that. Personally when someone starts throwing dollar figures, I just skim past it. If it's not ""maxed out"",  your goal is to max it out. [deleted] Daily buys make zero sense to me.

Weekly, biweekly or monthly buys would be just as good and would be a lot less effort on your end. Plus, your purchase history must look like a mess.

I feel like as my portfolio has grown, looking at it has gone down. Investment & wealth are meant to give you a better life & more freedom. You're golden-handcuffing yourself with your approach. [deleted] I work in Bahrain, its tax free location for US citizens. I make little over 8k a month. My rent and utilities is 2k a month, fully furnished 2 bed 2 bath with a pool. Unless your wastefully spending, spending the extra 2k on living expense is a challenge. My thought on why i have the CD's they outperform, my banks saving accounts. They act as my one year emergency fund, earning a high rate than my banks HYS account. You make a valid point on leaving money on the table. As the CD's mature ill transfer to SGOV. What is your income level? It can’t be too high for Roth, but yet you save that much? You must live WELL below your means. 

You should speak with a pro. Maybe not to actually manage your money, but to review how you invest. 

Just off the top of my head: you’re likely under contributing to 401k, thus overpaying your taxes. 

Ditch CD’s for SGOV, turn on div reinvestment and don’t overthink. 

Learn to see historical performance on your platform to compare to benchmark. You’re too young to care about dividends (just overpaying taxes again).

You are doing AWESOME though. But you asked lol If you're comfortable with your process, stick with it. Everyone is different. > $1,500 for $75 daily market buy of $35 VOO, the other $40 is split between SPMO, SCHB, SCHD, SCHF, and SPYD

Why are you buying both VOO and SCHB, which are almost identical? 

Why also a momentum version of US large caps? 

Why are you buying both SCHD and SPYD? They have little overlap but similar ideas.

Why a focus on dividends given [dividend irrelevance] (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendirrelevance.asp)?

Why no emerging markets?

> $420 goes into SGOV. I use this as a ""warchest"" fund when the market dips. Like they did in April 2025. I'm not lucky enough to time pulling out, before the market will dips. I just buy heavy when they are.

Are you comfortably holding onto that when there's a sustained bear market of ten years without any significant dips, like we had most recently after 2010?

How do you decide when to get in? I don't know why people buy CDs now.  They usually have lower rates than a money market fund.

1m86k3r,2025-07-24,"Should I diversify out of google?
Right now I have an investment account, with about 700 shares of googles worth around 110,000, which makes up about half to a third of my 250,000~ $ portfolio. I’ve made some good choices with my other stocks like buying nvidia in 2022, (up 30 grand on that one) other mixes includes blue chip tech stocks like Apple Microsoft, aswell as the s&p 500. I like google and it’s a strong company but I also think that I have too much of it.
I like Google for the long term, but if the 250k is your entire portfolio - you are probably in need of diversification in the direction of the sp500 Why not stop buying more of Google and invest more into the index ,rather than selling it? Contrarian point: concentration is key for outsized returns. 

Google still looks like a steal compared to others mega caps, but trim if it feels too big for you. The PE ratio is still only 20 though. Its well under the valuation of every other MAG7 company and most tech stocks. Even VOO is 27. Diversification is for losers You should Google it or ask Gemini It just ran up like 30% since April; I don't think it's a bad time to sell. Take profits and move it into QQQ or VOO and treat yourself to dinner. Google is still cheap vs other megacaps, but one third is too much. I'm going to be a bit obnoxious - sorry, I hate being the ""well _technically_"" guy but it's an important and easy to miss point for people reading.


Broad market indices are fantastic and diversification is great, but the S&P is _heavily_ weighed in tech just by nature of the US economy having such a strong tech presence. Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Apple each individually make up more than 5% of SPY/VOO.


I do agree though, that much weight in any one stock is risky. It works until it doesn't, you pay double downside risk for a modest extra gain. I agree. I'm holding GOOGL and not interested in selling it. But it's also not 1/3 of my portfolio.

1m85apt,2025-07-24,"Not all top 10 tech stocks are the same
A lot is being said about the high valuations and long outperformance of the tech stocks and how risky and overvalued they are as a bunch. But there's an enormous difference just among the top 10 tech stocks by size.

TSLA is trading at a PE of 177 which doesn't make the remotest bit of sense based on the business that they are in (cars) and could be in (robotaxis, robots, and AI), even if they were wildly successful in new business areas (in which they face stiff competition) there is no way to justify the current valuation.

PLTR's PE is over 600 not much more I need to say about that.

GOOG is trading at a PE of 21. Its core search business is going to be disrupted by AI but it is still entrenched and they have the time and resources to adapt. Meanwhile they own the largest streaming platform in YouTube, and arguably the most actually successful robotaxi business in Waymo. If they were ever split up the parts would be worth far more than the sum.

AAPL's heyday is behind it since their growth is anchored in devices and they will probably never acquire significantly more market share in phones meanwhile they have to create a new Fortune 500 sized business every year just to try to keep the growth going.

AMZN on the other hand is not bound by any particular industry or market. They are getting into satellites, pharmaceutical delivery, health care, and can pick any large market they want to address.

MSFT's new leadership after the atrocious Ballmer has brought the company into huge new markets and they are well positioned to capitalize on AI, with a PE of 39 they are not cheap but by far not the most expensive with solid growth prospects.

I personally think that social media is a scourge upon the earth and is destroying the minds of young and old people alike, but META has essentially monopolies that will not be disrupted. 

Meanwhile these companies are investing nearly $300 billion in cap ex per year and have returned nearly $1 trillion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends over the past 5 years. These aren't unprofitable ""dot com bubble"" stocks but entrenched cash cows.
Palantir is not a top 10 tech market cap stock And if my grandmother had wheels she would have been a bike This isn't very good information. You seem to be largely focused on PE but that has proven to be a poor indicator.

You mention PLTR, you could have bought it in March with a PE of 300 and you would have implied that was way too high; yet had you bought it then you would have about doubled your money. 

GOOG has had a depressed PE all year relative to the mag 7. 

PE tells you what the company is doing today. People buy these companies based on what they think they can do tomorrow. That has always bent he case with TSLA, if they are successful in self driving and now humanoids their value will go to the moon. Whether you think TSLA will or won't, that is your call. But it has nothing to do with current PE [deleted] I’m only going to comment on the Apple part. 

87-88% of US teenagers own an IPhone and expect their next phone to be an iPhone. These teenagers will eventually grow old and hand their own iPhone to their kids. Boomers will slowly fade away and so with the android phone in the US. 

Apples installed base and paid service growth should continue to grow in the US based on the majority of teenagers owning an iPhone. 

Of course I have no crystal ball and nothing can happen. Yea 
NVIDIA, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Broadcom, TSM, Oracle, and Tesla I guess Netflix. But I consider them more of a media company now. 
 
That’s 11ish. But if you don’t count Netflix and Tesla. Pltr does squeeze their way in.

Edit- I don't even agree, I'm just trying to explain what OP might be thinking imo. I agree that TSLA valuation is pure speculation on the future robotaxi business and AI use but ultimately they do face very stiff competition from others in the same market. Waymo and even Amazon (Zoox) are progressing rapidly in their robotaxi testing and rollout. tbh all the concern about GOOG and AI is overblown... its not like Google is being Kodak and just sitting around waiting for the axe to drop.

Google is as much in the AI race as anyone... and they seem to be doing just fine. Put it another way, if you are buying automotives based on PE you would love Ford with a PE of 8. But had you bought 1 year ago, TSLA is up 41% and and F is down -17% Waymo had to completely redesign their tech after that initial rollout around Mountain View. It was a mess. 

As of March this year they are already averaging 250,000 paid autonomous trips a week. Operating in 4 US cities now, steadily working their way up with rollouts in Miami, Atlanta, and DC expected soon, alongside testing in Houston, Dallas, and Vegas.

we're poor by most American *lifestyle* standards. Single income household: $60k/yr tradeworker. Married, Childfree. We are married to our homestead. we don't vacation or travel anymore. I drive a 26 year old truck, wife drives a 12 year old compact.

I (we) started investing in October/November of 2015. Invested everything in VTSAX for 3 years, then started VIG and a few others. by 2018, I had accumulated several quality broad market stocks (AMZN, BP, KO, F, MU, etc...) as well. 90% of Roth is in broad market S&P funds. nothing crazy, all pretty basic and proven. I invested what I could, when I could. in 2019, we paid off our suburban house. we stayed put, saved HYSA, and maxed Roth for 2 years. then we sold our house, bought land, and built our homestead dreamhouse 2022-2023. we currently owe about $140k total on the house & acreage. land @ 1.5% for 12 years. house @ 5.12% with 27 years remaining. I am able to *reliability* contribute about $100/mo to Roth currently.

NET worth: ~$410,000 (mostly house/land)
Good on you mate. I think clean air, home grown food etc is the real wealth, especially with the way things are going. 
Keep saving. They say the first 100k of investments is the hardest. You are so close.  You are the American Dream and a great example to a lot of people who live paycheck to paycheck, thinking they're better off gambling their income on penny stocks or the sports gambling. Survive? OP is not out on the street begging for food. They have 400k in invested assets, living on their 'dream' homestead property on an acreage of land. The wife is not working outside of the home.

There are millions of people in the world that would give their lives to have even the opportunity to achieve what they have. They didn't go on any vacations? Okay, boo who. Their decision not have kids is entirely theirs.

Where in this scenario are they not thriving? Because they don't have a brand new car?

I don't get it. The first 100k is definitely the hardest. They go much faster after that. 

If they maintain that 11.2% return for the 15 years until the Roth is accessible tax free it will grow to \~470k I just thinking about the new American Dream and how it's becoming surviving without kids like OP. wife works full-time on the homestead. *we* worked together at a business we created from the ground up. we sold it in 2023 because profits were down, wife was tired of the clientele, and we couldn't justify the fuel & time to drive 25 miles, one-way, into town 5 days a week. livestock and farming are a full-time job. The first billion is typically harder than the first $100k.

But once you hit your first billion, you can let off the gas a little.

- Warrne Buffet If you and your wife are happy, it sounds like you won the game. Couple points to think about - make sure you have health insurance. You're at the age where something can happen and wipe you out. 

Second, start planning to hire help on the homestead. When 45 turns into 50 and 55, it's going to get a lot harder physically.

I'm not too much older than you and have a house I'm fixing up that came with citrus, olives, figs, etc... and while it's not a ton of trees it's still a lot work that isn't exactly easy on the body.

1m825ok,2025-07-24,"Bond ETFs for EU investors akin to SGOV in returns and liquidity
***To preface this, I've been buying/selling stocks for 4 years I believe, but my knowledge is fairly surface level. And when it comes to any other financial product I am out of my depths.***

Yesterday when reading a pot here I learned about SGOV, they return a 4.53% dividend and pay out every month. I thought this was a very attractive store for my cash instead of my 1.5% savings account here in the EU. But on my brokerage platform they only over the 0-1 year IShares SGOV bonds.

I saw a product that kind of looks similar which is: JPM USD Ultra-short income UCITS ETF. But I have to admit I don't know how different this is compared to SGOV and I am out of my depths on this topic I believe.

I also heard that taking US bonds as someone who pays with euro is not smart since exchange rates can wobble a lot, although this ETF is bought in euro, it is probably pegged to the dollar so there is risk there I assume.

So here is my question. For EU investors what are the options if we are talking about ETFs similar to SGOV with the same kiind of dividend payout and possibly that also pays out more regularly than yearly?

Not asking for someone to tell me where to park my money but I just want to get an idea of the market, I have no clue about bonds. Maybe some reading material as well if you can recommend some?
This involves buying an ETF that holds a basket of short-term (0-1 year) government bonds from the highest-rated Eurozone countries. This is the most direct equivalent to `$SGOV` in terms of diversification across high-quality issuers.

A top choice that is widely available is:

* [iShares € Govt Bond 0-1yr UCITS ETF (Acc)](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00B3FH7618)
   * **Ticker examples:** `IBGZ` (XETRA), `IE00` (Euronext Amsterdam)
   * **ISIN:** `IE00B3FH7618`

This ETF holds bonds from countries like Germany, France, and the Netherlands. Its yield will very closely track the key ECB interest rates (like the deposit facility rate), minus its small expense ratio (TER). It's an excellent place to park Euros to earn the current short-term ""risk-free"" rate. > SGOV, they return a 4.53% dividend

Sometimes. In 2021 it was a 0.03% dividend.

SGOV invests in short-duration, US government treasuries. As far as bond style boxes go, short-duration means very low interest rate sensitivity on principal value, and US government bonds are high credit quality. Generally, a very safe bet...

...other than the fact that, as you note, as a European investor you expose yourself to foreign currency risk. Sometimes that works for you, sometimes against.

The yield will follow short-term interest rates. 

In any event, if you wanted something similar, you'd want a short-duration bond ETF, denominated in Euro and in the Euro zone. iShares does have something along those lines, in the ""iShares € Govt Bond 0-1yr UCITS ETF."" Looks like the 12-month trailing yield is 2.8%. sgov invests in us govt treasuries, its just a money market fund, with a slightly different way of achieving the same rate.  Our short term funding rate (fed funds rate) is much higher than the ecbs, but based on your post i feel like your in the UK, and short sterling rates (SONIA)

the equiv woudl be something liek XSTR which tracks the 1-5y gilts.

the UCITS fund you mentioned actually outperforms SGOV because it invests in corp bonds instead of government treasuries, so the yield is marginally higher. (for the us investors here, that etf in the US is **JPST**)

if you want to yield us short term rates yield, then as a non-dollar investor, you will have to accept the GBPUSD currency risk (or hedge out your GBP exposure, and eat the losses -> this is called a cross currency basis swap. Thanks for this concise summary! I'll look into it, this sounds very attractive Yeah pretty much what I though. Thanks for the information! I'll have a closer look at more EU options and I'll look at the recommendation you made, appreciate the effort. Maybe I should've just said, But I am in the EU economic zone, I assume the UK is not included anymore since they left. But I assume what you said holds true for EU countries so since there is still a Euro-USD risk correct, and the local version of a short interest rate is called euribor (1.9%) and thats even lower than fed funds (4.25) or sonia.  so not much local yield without currency risk. You're right that this was the situation for a long time, but the 1.9% rate you mentioned is outdated. The ECB has hiked rates significantly, and the key overnight rates are now around 4.0%.

This has completely changed the landscape. EU investors can now get a decent, low-risk yield in Euros without taking on currency risk.

The local equivalents to SGOV would be money market ETFs tracking the Euro Short-Term Rate (€STR), like XEON or CSH2, or ultra-short-term government bond ETFs like CBUG. 3m term euribor is 1.939% right now. im staring at the close price at today's wmr.

1m7z4ty,2025-07-24,"What would you say would be the best IPO to invest in based with great potential for growth
So am 62 years old and have left it far too late to start investing but am trying to identify the best way to make some money quickly :) same as everyone else!  I've already purchased some VOO SPY Nvidia etc but think ""gambling"" on the right IPO could be very lucrative.  Ideas?
Are you trying to gamble your retirement money or is this money you’re ok with losing? Ligma is also about to IPO None of them. IPOs are not good like you think they are. Figma is about to IPO, its a product that everyone uses, not sure if the valuation is good. Ive only lost on IPOs personally. Unless you have a $1M margin account, IPOs are not the way to make money. 

I’m a decade behind you ;)… and I’ve never invested in an IPO and I’ve been actively trading since 2008 and investing for over 30yrs now. 

Don’t ever think you can make money quick. 

Can you go outside your house and find something to make money fast? No, of course not…otherwise you would have done that!

There is a reason 90% of day traders loose money. Make some money =/= quickly. 

The only safe-ish way to make money is to take the long-term view and rely on compound interest. Everything else is inherently risky, and unless you’re a professional, it’s more gambling than investing. 

If it’s money you’re fine losing, go ahead. But there isnt a magic cheat code that lets average Joe turn his 300k into 3 Mil for cozy retirement. Yes. Never heard of it, what's uhpdahg?

1m7nbs7,2025-07-23,"Is 75% Net Income spent on CAPEX too much for GOOG?
In April the narrative was ""Tech is spending too much on CAPEX"". It really impacted companies like MSFT and NVDA which at the time was the right call to call that bluff.

But now, with GOOG coming out declaring it wants to spend upwards of 75% of its net income on CAPEX. Is it too much going forward?

GOOG's CAPEX has increased from a 49% average pre 2016, to a current average of 54.2% of its net income. But now it wants to spend nearly 75% for estimated 2025 Net income. And says it'll increase even more in 2026.

A bigger concern is that all this infrastructure has a high attrition rate. Servers need replacing on a 5 year cycle. So the likelihood expensive buildouts now will persist later is a problem as well.

At what point is the CAPEX expenditure too much? 
What's the alternative, if they take their foot off the gas one of the other companies investing at the same rate will surpass them. They can't afford to let up. Spend it! Growing all businesses and most importantly cloud grew 32% and is taking market share. Cloud business alone could be worth 1T+ in 2026. Great return on investment. 

The goal is to get everyone locked into the Google AI ecosystem. Developers making Google Android apps that use Google Gemini models on Google TPUs hosted on Google Cloud. Content creators using Google Veo3 on Google TPUs in Google Cloud and delivering content via Google Youtube. Etc. Exactly.  Assuming their thesis is correct and AI is a groundbreaking tech, investing now is how you become next generation's Google and Apple as opposed to last generation's Yahoo! and Nokia.  

There's a reason why everyone (except Apple) is investing in AI.  They want to be the next ""front page of the internet"" like Google Search.  There is a reason why everyone is investing in VR/MR Glasses.  They want to be the next Smartphone/Apple.

There's not a lot of moments in history where you can lock down billions of people into a ecosystem and it's happening right now.

Now, people may disagree with their thesis and that's a fair stance as well.  But I mean...the fallback is still Google and Apple. Do we really need any more buybacks. Like with how much cash they’re printing what else should they do with it lol. Also judging by segment growth the RoI on capex seems to actually be quite high  They have a more intelligent management team than me, it's a little high in my opinion, but they run such a tight ship and if they continue to be innovative and be competitive I'm just going to keep investing. This exactly, they would rather overspend than underspend. Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft are all spending big bucks here. Its why I bought Google shares recently, they and Meta realize this is a pivotal moment for them, if they dont win then they will become irrelevant long term.

I think Google is making the right moves personally, and their Income Statement looks fantastic They need to make it over the AI transition and make sure to not get left behind.

The worst case is ChatGPT killing search while Google has nothing.

They need to have cutting edge models and keep up in that race and all the capex spend is worth it. Right, a company willing to invest in itself is going to progress more. 

I mean think about it this way, would you rather a company spend only 20% on CAPEX? No way Meanwhile Apple has been shitting the bed all across the board. 

Their ecosystem is great and every hardware I own is Apple. BUT they have been stagnating on everything for years, their version of AI with Siri is just laughably bad given the resources they have and I their only growth is piggybacking off companies selling software through the Apple Store.",164,0.84,102,0,Standard-Sample3642,investing,"['MSFT', 'NVDA']",75 net income spent capex much goog april narrative tech spending much capex really impacted companies like msft nvda time right call call bluff goog coming declaring wants spend upwards 75 net income capex much going forward googs capex increased 49 average pre 2016 current average 542 net income wants spend nearly 75 estimated 2025 net income says itll increase even 2026 bigger concern infrastructure high attrition rate servers need replacing 5 year cycle likelihood expensive buildouts persist later problem well point capex expenditure much whats alternative take foot gas one companies investing rate surpass cant afford let spend growing businesses importantly cloud grew 32 taking market share cloud business alone could worth 1t 2026 great return investment goal get everyone locked google ai ecosystem developers making google android apps use google gemini models google tpus hosted google cloud content creators using google veo3 google tpus google cloud delivering content via google youtube etc exactly assuming thesis correct ai groundbreaking tech investing become next generations google apple opposed last generations yahoo nokia theres reason everyone except apple investing ai want next front page internet like google search reason everyone investing vrmr glasses want next smartphoneapple theres lot moments history lock billions people ecosystem happening right people may disagree thesis thats fair stance well meanthe fallback still google apple really need buybacks like much cash theyre printing else lol also judging segment growth roi capex seems actually quite high intelligent management team little high opinion run tight ship continue innovative competitive im going keep investing exactly would rather overspend underspend meta amazon microsoft spending big bucks bought google shares recently meta realize pivotal moment dont win become irrelevant long term think google making right moves personally income statement looks fantastic need make ai transition make sure get left behind worst case chatgpt killing search google nothing need cutting edge models keep race capex spend worth right company willing invest going progress mean think way would rather company spend 20 capex way meanwhile apple shitting bed across board ecosystem great every hardware apple stagnating everything years version ai siri laughably bad given resources growth piggybacking companies selling software apple store

The company is part of the Nasdaq 100, S&P 100 and S&P 500.”

*Financials according to Seeking Alpha:

Market Cap: $183 billion
Revenue: $8.7 billion (up 19% YOY)
Net Income: $2.5 billion
Debt: $0 🫨
Cash: $4.5 billion
Net Income Margin: 28.4%

Currently trading at approx $494, down from its peak of about $610 in Jan 2025.

The company is saying their business will take a slight hit if tariffs on Germany, Mexico and China (countries they receive parts and equipment from) are high. But with that net income and no debt burden… they are clearly in a great position. 

Of course, this is not financial advice and you should do your own due diligence. Just wanted to bring this to your attention for those who find this as interesting as I do.

Currently sitting on 28 shares and will double it over the course of the next 6 months.
A pe of 69 if I am not mistaken? Would make it rather expensive. Great company, but falling knife. Will watch for support around 477. It happens to everyone, I have my own I wish I could go back in time with but is what it is. Not sure I would use the word disaster lol this is the type of downturn to be taken advantage of especially if it drops further. When a company like this has the inverse of revenues up stock price down, that’s the perfect time to gobble up shares. 

What are a couple of stock plays you have the most interest in right now? It's tough to find quality stocks that aren't vastly overbought. If the market rally continues, I like GOOGL, AAPL, and AMZN to catch up and make new all-time highs. Also watching BA to finally fill that gap to 240 area.

On the more speculative side TMC is my favorite, undersea mining for rare minerals.

Security stocks are always on my radar for longer-term and they have been breaking down recently and may offer lower entries especially if market enters a consolidation or pullback. My favorites are CRWD and ZS. JnJ was trying to do a competitor (Ottava?) but I wonder if they will ever displace any installed Da Vinci systems.  Wonder if the lock-in is similar to what you experience at any corporate IT dept where there's pressure to buy the most widespread, tested vendor solution. Traditionally speaking I agree with you. One could wait for that number to come down some, assuming that it will. But with that said, if you look at a company like Palantir, they’re trading at a PE of around 650 which is just insane. Not that these two companies are in the same category per se, but the value is there so the premium is high > A pe of 69

So it's super cheap! these days, lol

I was looking at a company to invest in, PE 6 and P / cash flow 3. Looks like a good level. I hope it keeps dropping I will continue buying on the way down I agree with you that there are companies which rise very high even with an already high pe. These companies are usually however quite new or with disrupting technology (Tesla, Palantir). You can get very rich from this but it does come with quite a risk. This is my ""one that got away"" that I wish I had purchased a decade ago and just held.

1m7dgdt,2025-07-23,"Gold probably entering bear market soon
It bothers me to see advertisements for investments. Just remember nothing worth buying needs to be advertised.

Gold at these prices will not hedge anything or protect your investments. Even if Gold went to $4000/oz that's only a 15% gain, which is a sneeze for NVDA etc. 15% isn't enough to protect a full equity portfolio and is nothing compared to where bonds will go in a market crash.

Either way the monthly slow stochastic is the poker-tell on gold going back to the beginning when the gold window was closed. So there's no reason not to believe it now. When slow stochastic falls below 80 on the monthly chart that's always been the top. We're getting there soon by the current trajectory. One more month of no new high would meet the criteria.

The linear regression is maxed out, gold only breaks the monthly linear regression at tops as well and it broke above a couple months ago and never made a new high since, just like all previous tops before major bear markets.

I will short Gold when it loses the monthly slow stochastic at 80. That'll signal a new gold bear market and those can last 10+ years.

I'd buy gold back at $2300/oz or below.
They aren't advertising for the investment. They are advertising for the spread they make on selling you the investment.  Same thing when you see a Charles Schwab commercial. Shorting gold seems like a terrible idea because you don’t really know where it’s going to go.

I agree with the general sentiment that I don’t think it’s a good time to buy in a ton.

Silver is in a better position right now.  I've heard that China started buying gold more instead of US Bonds. So gold is overvalued? But Nvidia is not? Interesting,,,

The reason why gold is so high, is because the value of the dollar is so low. And the dollar will continue to fall, due to insane government debt spending. So comparing gold to historic movements is not relevant once you know why gold has risen so much in the first place.  
  
Succes with shorting gold. It is like saying the US will suddenly stop increasing their budget deficit and the FED won't print money in the future anymore. You won’t be buying gold for $2300 an oz until we are able to build it from scratch in a lab. 

I’m not sure gold has a ton of room to run, but zero change it falls that much. Not with every major country being in extreme debt and pushing themselves further into it. op is a technicals trader/alchemist who doesn't understand gold isn't an investment, it's a hedge (albeit one that, while it has performed recently, typically only shows efficacy over extremely long time horizons). “AcTuAlLy” 🤓🥸 

Bro… did you know we can also perform nuclear fusion. But it’s too expensive so we don’t do it yet. 

Bro. It doesn’t matter until you can do it at scale. Thanks. I'll take the otherside of this dumb analysis everyday.

Shortsellers of gold become future gold buyers. Thanks man! If there was a reliable ""forward-looking"" indicator that Gold is going down, people that are likely smarter than you, better financed, better connected and with more resources would act on the information before you ever had the chance to notice. Their act of shorting the commodity would produce headwinds on the price of Gold therefore removing your opportunity to ever take advantage of this inefficiency.

Just stop. I've written this above response or something similar for nearly every asset class you can think of for nearly 20 years and whenever I do get a chance to look through my post history here on Reddit or on the various investing forums or facebook groups I've been a part of and  I see that the ""nobody knows anything"" theory prove itself correct time and time again, the original posters have either deleted their posts or are no longer part of the community or create a ""Yes, but"" excuse, etc.

There is no easy way to make big returns. Instead focus on diversification, a high savings rate and staying the course instead of looking for some secret strategy and you'll do much better and sleep much better. how you gonna short gold bro? you realize you have to pay interest even if you find a broker willing to loan it to you (at a high rate since i can tell you are not institution worthy credit)...you only gain on a massive fall in price.

1m6ujjw,2025-07-23,"S&P Gap at 4650 must be filled.
Historically, CME gaps are filled on the S&P. Since 1997 no gap exists that hasn't been filled except this one.

There's a rather large, glaring and obviously well placed gap at 4650 that coincides with January 2022 top and August 2023 top.

This gap will be filled and make for a good ""buy the dip price"" in the future. No reason to sit on \~40% gains on the $SPY and risk losing all that annualized return while there's an obvious gap to be filled.

The Gap would represent a retest of prior highs from 2021 period and the ""break out"" from 2021 highs which occurred in 2023. A pretty typical retest that happens in every bull market recovery.

Timing the market has never been so easy. Bonds are the obvious bet now.
Nothing actually “must” be done in the markets, I think we’ve learned that just over the last 5 years. Isn’t there still a gap off the covid lows?

1m6tkq5,2025-07-22,"I have a moderately aggressive investing strategy and done well. I am now nervous about weaker dollar coupled with ‘irrational exuberance’. Want to lock in profits
Want to exit the rash NVDA and PLTR world for now. 

Thinking of …

Gold via IAU (30%)

S&P value via SPLV (30%)

Treasuries via SGOV (40%)

This would be in a tax deferred account. 

Thoughts / suggestions / prayers 

SGOV is ultra-short duration Treasury exposure. There might be better alternatives out there. Any suggestions are appreciated.
SGOV is pretty good substitute for MMF or high yield savings acct for 4.1% today.  You could get a slightly better rate with brokered CD's like 4.3% for 3month, currently.  

Do you like how SPLV held up around April-2 this year ?  I doubt it.

The problem with ""exiting"" your aggressive strategy, is that to me, it never feels like a good time to get back in, until the top.  Of course that is much too late. [deleted] Yes, the age old - when to buy and when to sell. Trying to time the market is an expensive hobby.

I don’t own any SPLV yet. What better options exists? SCHD, VYM, VTI? CDs lock you in. I can reenter / reexit SGOV anytime. Yeah. Most pros are very conservative. I like occasionally dabbling a little in the momentum plays as well. I personally think VYMI is the sleeper pick right now, trading at nearly half the forward P/E of VYM or SPLV. It may be international equities but they’re all huge global companies just like the S&P 500, just valued much closer to historic means. You’re planning to go 30% SPLV, the rest basically cash equivalents, and you think a pro portfolio is conservative? 

That’s like criticizing a car brand for not offering fast sporty cars when you are designing mini vans… like really slow mini vans. Like slower than a conservative car maker would make slow mini vans. Lol As I mentioned, I made good money. 

PLTR, DDOG, CRWD, NVDA etc. 

So, for now, plan to lock in my gains.

1m6pcti,2025-07-22,"Going Back to School – $64k to Invest
I'm returning to school soon, and the cost will be about $36k per year after scholarships. I currently have around $100k in cash. 

My original plan was to roll the funds through short term T-bills while attending school which would be risk free and yield decent returns. However, I'm exploring the idea of allocating the remaining $64k (after paying for the first year) into one or two solid companies that could see solid upside in the next 2/3 years. If everything goes well, I would then liquidate a portion of the position for each payment period (after 1 year). The school provides 4 payment periods throughout each semester thankfully.

I’m mainly considering large-cap names that I believe are either fairly valued or potentially undervalued. AAPL, GOOGL, and LLY are on my radar. MSFT is also in the mix as a durable compounder. I’m intentionally avoiding anything too speculative or volatile (like TSLA or NVDA), and I’m not looking at mid-cap or high-beta plays.

Are there any companies this community sees as fitting into this plan or should I likely stick with fixed income? I would greatly appreciate any insights or ideas on where you’d look if you were in a similar situation.

Thanks in advance.
Would not recommend investing the money. In the event of a drawdown, you will have to sell low on the stocks, take on additional debt, and/or delay your education.

I am personally not averse to short-term horizon investing, but only when I can back out of the purchase (to continue holding) and not take on new debt or affect the trajectory of my life/career. Even in your situation tax  harvesting losses would not help, If it came to it.  
There is time the younger you are to wait. The safest choice is likely to put them into a Fidelity Cash Management Account which currently has roughly 4% APY, or otherwise a money market fund which has low risk and is easy to liquidate. SGOV (tbill ETF) is easier than rolling tbills which most are not very good at doing. Set to dividend reinvestment, life is easier. 

Money you don’t intend to touch 5 years or more: VOO, don’t overthink. Have emergency fund. That’s how all personal finance works. Sell when you have something urgent to pay for. 

Anything you might need in two years or less, SGOV. True, I think I needed someone to just say that. I’ll probably just focus on rolling my money from t-bill to t-bill then. Knowing my luck, whatever I put it in, will collapse in share price and then I’m beyond screwed. Thanks for providing a reality check. It doesn't have to be all or nothing. You can do like 80% t bills 20% in whatever you want. Or whatever your risk tolerance is.

I don't have a lot of capital. 5k account and growing but looking into more riskier bets. Trying out options in paper trading with Webull and doing well... And I hate it.

This is all money I'm willing to see go to 0 and have emergency funds saved and a Roth IRA but I still cant bring myself to buying 28DTE calls on NVDA or the like because it's too risky. And I don't have the funds to collect premiums for the wheel strategy. 


This post has mainly just been a rant but I need to ask. When did you decide to say ""fuck it""? What made you feel more comfortable? Did you ever paper trade?  Tell me your story of how you got started so I can turn to the next chapter in my book of investing.

 Thank you. 
The problem with paper trading is that it lacks the ability to simulate psychological and emotional factors.

And depending on the paper trading platform - it may not account for slippage when live trading.

If you are using discretionary trading strategies - paper trading is kinda useless imo.

\[edit\] - And if you are using a mechanical strategy - paper trading is useful for forward-testing. But you should have back-tested your algo's first. And if the forward-testing matches your back-testing expectation - then you probably should be ready to go. Go over the r/wallstreetbets this sub is mostly against options Post it here. I don't accept dms That's true for lots of things related to investing, not just options. It depends entirely on how you do things.  There's nothing inherently bad about options. Youre getting fake fills when u paper trade and can sell with no volume. Dont get false confidence. Just buy 1 contract with real money, lose it all, then realize buying options is ass. Sell options if anything but u need capital to do it. This is a great way to put it. Paper trade to test mechanical strategies rather than just testing my gut. I thank you for the kind and helpful comment. Yeah, I'm not going to buy into their bot shills haha. Options must have a reason for existing beyond gambling addiction. I've always heard that if you use options as intended you can fit it into your normal trade strategy to earn a little extra. If I like a stock, I can sell a put at a reasonable delta and buy in at a discounted price while earning premiums either way. Or selling calls to exit and getting premiums regardless.

1m6m8iy,2025-07-22,"Over exposed to a single stocks?
Hi everyone. 

I’m hoping a discussion on when, how and why shifting investments could or could not be the right thing to do. Especially when taking profits to move them elsewhere. 

Is it smart to hold stocks in companies you’re already exposed to in an ETF? 

For example, if you had 100k USD and your portfolio resembles the below. (Hypothetical) 

VOO - 30% 
NVDA - 40% 
META - 30%

 • Would this be considered over exposed? 

• Would it be beneficial to move everything into an ETF that has exposure to NVDA & META among other things? 

• Would you see greater growth out of your 100k in one place? 

• If you were to sell individual holdings, for considerable gains opening you up for tax obligations how would this affect your decision? 

I understand that investing is a personal journey and decisions are based off your own risk tolerance, time frame, goals, etc. I would just like to hear some discussion of those who have navigated this in the past. 


Thanks in advance. 


Definitely overexposed which makes the portfolio less efficient due to adding idiosyncratic risk which is “not compensated”.

However this will lead to greater returns if those companies outperform the underlying index. Lesser returns if they underperform. That’s obvious.

Selling with considerable capital gains should not be a bad thing at all. Learn to sell when you feel overextended. You lose more than taxes if you lose on your position. Set aside money to pay capital gains next year.

I went from $230k to $2.5M in 2 years on a 100% TSLA stock portfolio. Dumb? Yes. Did it work? Yes. Do I regret making a bad portfolio decision? Absolutely not. \> Is it smart to hold stocks in companies you’re already exposed to in an ETF?

It is irrelevant, neither smart nor dumb.  Having more shares of good stocks is good; having more shares of shitty stocks is bad.

\> Would this be considered over exposed?

If 70% of your assets is two stocks, most people would consider that overexposed.  

\> Would it be beneficial to move everything into an ETF that has exposure to NVDA & META among other things?

If you asked this two years, the answer would have proved definitely not since NVDA and META have kicked butt in that time.  But again most people would consider it safer and more prudent to get your assets more diversified.  So most people would go for safer, but there is a good chance that will make you less money.

\> Would you see greater growth out of your 100k in one place?

No reason for that, unless you have a crystal ball that knows which single thing is going to do best from now on.

\> If you were to sell individual holdings, for considerable gains opening you up for tax obligations how would this affect your decision?

This is the difficult question.  It usually doesn't make sense to pay taxes for no particular reason. Definitely over exposed especially considering that those companies make up like 10% of VOO or something.  If you want to play it “safe” you use ETFs.

If you want to take risk you pick individual stocks.

Many years ago I picked individual stocks (NVDA being one of them) based on convictions and what I consider an edge over the market (my technical programming knowledge). Those factors gave me tolerance for risk and I’m glad I invested in what I did, despite picking some losers as well. Believe it or not I have AMZN taking up 50% of my investment money. Over the last 30 years it had explosive growth. So that’s the good part.

The bad part is it’s in taxable account so I haven’t sold it yet.

Fortunately rest of the portfolio is managed by Fidelity and diversified in stock funds. Bad part is almost 75% of my money is in stocks. Not a good position for a retired person.

You get the most growth by staying in a specific stock (NVDA, META).  
By definition index fund would be diversified hence less performing than specific stock. However it will reduce your exposure to one or two stock. Yes, most people aim for a maximum of 20% of one stock. Since you also have VOO, I would go for about 15%. 

Does it mean a stock can never be higher than 20% of your portfolio? Imo it doesn't, if you bought NVDA a couple of years ago and it became 40% of your portfolio, you can decide to keep it if you believe that it has a decent upside. But be sure to have good risk management and decrease or close your position when it drops to a certain point. AMZN overexposure Apparently there was this guy that had 2M in Sofi at $8, 100% of his account.

This marks a significant shift in the bank’s stance on digital assets.

1m60sgx,2025-07-22,"Advise needed about Edward Jones and Morgan Stanley
A close relative of mine has accounts with Edward Jones’s and Morgan Stanley. He is very unhappy with everything about Morgan Stanley (treatment, investment knowledge of the advisor assigned, etc. ) on the other hand, he is very satisfied with the Edward Jones’ advisor. 

This person asked me my thoughts about these two investment houses. Honestly, I’m a fan of Fidelity, Schwab and vanguard. Mainly because of the amount of data they make available to the investor! I’ve never invested with Morgan Stanley nor Edward Jones. What are your experiences of these two?

What are your thoughts about these two legacy investment houses? 
I mean if you're happy and content why change? Morgan Stanley is one of the top 2-3 broker dealers available.   That being said they have tens of thousands of advisors.   About 1/3 are excellent and another 1/3 are good to very good and the remainder are also rans.   Edward Jones advisors basically only have package products to sell where the MS advisor has most everything in the world available to him.    But a important part of who to use starts with what are the assets under management?   Over ten million?   Nobody is better than MS although some are close.   One million?   That is about the minimum a MS advisor can handle.   Less than that and the account will be so small they likely will ignore it even if they accept accounts that small.   For a one million dollar account or slightly less Edward Jones may have less products to use but they likely will value a small account a lot more than somebody at a big shop like MS. He likely personally knows the EJ advisor. “Assigned” Morgan Stanley means he was probably passed off. 

So no offense here, but: why is this person asking you? It sounds to me like they are not good judges of advisors if they are asking you. 

Brokers are kind of irrelevant, it’s like saying what is better between two car brands, surely you realize this is not really a good question. 

Knowledge of the advisor is rather irrelevant also. People who believe the advisor has some sort of special knowledge tells me they believe in magic recipes (there are none).

How he is treated is DEFINITELY relevant. So if one treats bette than the other, I wonder why he stays with the one he doesn’t like. Hope that helps! edward jones had constantly people who complain about underperforming. It’s probably the biggest investing scam. But maybe he has been lucky so far.

Morgan Stanley is the biggest US AUM investor. Most wealthy and ultra wealthy are with Morgan Stanley. I’m pretty satisfied with them.

But again, at the end of the day, it’s all about the advisor and the person who hired him. The age. Risk tolerance. goal and many other parameters. EJ is crazy bad, fees + commissions literally destroying growth.  Have them take a look at their portfolio growth vs the SP500 over the same period of time and if they're still happy, stay I guess. He asked me because I manage my own portfolio, even though Fidelity and Vanguard and have both assigned me complimentary advisors. I have no use for them as I’ve done pretty well managing my own portfolio. That’s a good answer. Your family member should always be on the lookout for someone better. 

So the purpose of an advisor is to help put on a plan and keep on track. Streamline and optimize, and push to do more. If they don’t do those things, then he might as well be with Fidelity (my favorite self directed platform). 

I assume this person is older though. So they likely don’t want to do it themselves. Yea. Tell him to consolidate, going to a bunch of different firms sucks come legacy passing time.

Margin = bad. Don’t buy an asset with liability. Margin is no joke, don't play until you have 100k in net worth. TRUST ME. This ain't WSB. I have 800k in investments but margin still scary. OP needs to understand that the S&P500 averages 7% over *decades of time*. Buying and holding 1-5-10 years still means you can see a *zero percentage return* called a lost decade. Or just a massive bear market taking you to negative - 30-40%.



OP is about to learn very quickly why there is no such thing as a free lunch. Nope. Stay away from margin for now...and possibly forever. Ladies, liquor, or leverage…

Buy what you can auto on a weekly basis. VOO or QQQM. Sell when you have something urgent to pay for. Earliest you realize this, the better off you will be. Best of luck!! Just stop. 

You’re talking about taking on a lot of risk for an average 2% gain. 

You’ll be sick to your stomach when there’s a 10-20% drop and you’re paying 5% on top of that to hold the bags. 

Just set up an auto transfer from you bank and an auto investment, turn on drip investments and then forget the app exists. I would refrain from that because you would still have to pay down the margin - I generally recommend using margin when there is an explicit path to paying it down. The SPY is an over time bet. 

I would wait one. Margin is a double edged sword, not inherently good or bad. Great if you know how to best leverage it for amplified gains, deadly if you use it to make stupid bets or if you overuse margin on your account. If you do want to use it, make sure you read up on what it is and how it works, it's not cheap money; it can destroy your account balance if you mismanage it.

1m5wzfk,2025-07-21,"Why is the market going up these days?

I know it sounds like a dumb question, and I realize it’s impossible to know, but I’ve asked it before and I’ve always gotten useful responses. “Bonds are doing this, so and so expects someone else to do that, some good things with trade” etc. The only unhelpful responses are “DCA, 401ks, etc”. I’m trying to understand what the motivating factors are that are unique to this quarter.

So why is the market going up right now, specifically the Nasdaq 100? What issues are in play?
""Why"" questions are really hard to answer when there's not a cohesive single agent that can tell you what they're thinking. The weighted sum of all of the actors of the system are willing to pay more for the same shares than they were last quarter.

Why? Well, there isn't really a why. This factor is bigger, that factor is smaller, investor A values one of those factors more than the other, etc. If you listen to any single of them and you get an answer like ""Bonds are doing this"", go look at every other time bonds have done that and see if the market did the same thing then. It probably didn't. Sometimes there are obvious things like inflation being up or down, but _why_ is inflation up or down? It's down to the same complex interactions.

I'd get away from thinking too hard about it, to be honest. Any easily digestible answer is probably wrong. It's not unknowable, like you can go and build up that weighted sum and look at the components and the result and economists spend their whole lives doing exactly that. It's just not going to be some nice round answer like you're hoping for. The money supply is always increasing. The same inflation that hits cheeseburgers that used to cost a dime hits stocks. 

So instead of thinking how much is my portfolio worth in dollars, think how much is it worth in houses, or cheeseburgers, and you see its not gone up nearly as much. Future earnings are expected to be good. This is the closest to a correct answer. The stock market is a “number from today multiplied by a story about tomorrow.” Dollar losing value

1m5wqv7,2025-07-21,"I was gifted some Iraqi Dinar, what should I do?
Hello all,

So an old neighbor may be 80s.. gifted me $25,000 Iraqi Dinar and told me to sign up on 
""DINAR RECAPS NEWSLETTER"" and to contact them to open a bank account and they will tell me when to deposit the money because they will exchange it for ""gold"" and they will also tell me when i can corvert that to money. He said this is worth 100k USD, and he wants to help my husband and I to buy a house. 

Y'all, I cried because he is so kind-hearted, but also, I got a little sad he lost his wife about a year ago. In my head, I was like, ""This sounds too good to be true,"" and well... I came across many reddit posts talking about this scam.

How should I break it down to him ? This is a scam. Maybe I should just keep the bill somewhere to remember my kind-hearted neighbor?

Thank you all. 


UPDATE: I SENT HIM AN EMAIL (SATURDAY MORNING) AND THANKED HIM AND BASICALLY TOLD HIM ITS A SCAM AND THAT I WAS GLAD TO RETURN THE DINARS BACK TO HIM. 

I JUST SPOKE TO HIM. APPARENTLY, HE HASNT READ MY EMAIL AND LAUGHED WHEN I SAID ITS A SCAM. HE ADVISED TO OPEN THE ACCOUNT AND CONVERT THE MONEY. HE SAID HE HAD THE IQD FOR LIKE 10 YEARS AND PEOPLE SPECULATE IS A SCAM AND IF I GOOGLE IT I'LL FIND PEOPLE SAYING IS A SCAM AND OTHERS SUCCESSFULLY GETTING THEIR MONEY. 

Y'ALL I TRIED. OH WELL. 
Google ""iraqi dinar scam""

Print out the top results and show him Shit. Oh god. This is a shitty situation to be in. I would honestly just be direct. There's no good way to do this. I appreciate it. Does your neighbor have any family that you can speak with? There is always the risk that your neighbor will get scammed out of more of their money. Kind of a shitty move to not at least try and tell him before he ends up eating cat food That exchange rate works out to about 19 bucks according to current google. No, I never even saw anyone visit them, and that just made me assume they only had each other. Ugh, yeah, I would hate for him to keep on getting scammed. And I when I visited him... I saw their scientology certificates as well. So I'm sure he is getting scammed at other places as well. 😕 Wait - do you have to tell him? 

Maybe just play along and let him think he changed your life? Aww, it was a nice gesture. But now its time for you to do something for him. You need to tell him its a scam.  It might not go over well but at least try before all his money is gone. He sounds like a good guy with not many people left, I think he deserves someone trying to help him.

If he thinks $25k Iraqi dinar is worth $100k USD. He says he has $30m USD worth that would be $7.5m Iraqi Dinar which is $5750 USD.

Natural Gas is now in a technical bearish signal. Below the 200 day and falling. The Nat-Gas // Crude ratio is at post GFC lows range which after as much inflation we've had shows extreme bearishness in both oil and nat-gas.

The ratio being on the bottom ratio should push drillers to seek more oily fields instead of gassy fields, or cap their fracks entirely. If the prices were healthy then it'd be ""bullish"" but shuttering business due to unhealthy prices is indicative of economic problems in the industries most sensitive to economic output.

Outside of Oil and Gas there's Copper.

SCCO which is a solid US copper producer has called copper's bluff. If you look at copper prices such as in 2008, the copper prices fell LAST. Not before the market crashed first. So it's interesting we see ""high copper prices"" but copper miners are not rallying with the copper price at larger.

Mine investors have more leverage to commodities than the commodities themselves so miners tend to front-run commodity prices, not follow them.

Declining oil producer stocks, gas producer stocks, and miner producer stocks shows a problem in the underbelly of the economy.

1m5q9mb,2025-07-21,"Another reason selling SPY makes sense now.
The VX (Vix) is now at historical levels that always signal bear markets. 2022, 2018, 2008, 2000, which is the furthest back you can go without reconstructed implied vol.

Regardless, this indicator is irrefutable because it's part of the ""Great Carry Trade"" which is detailed in the math-analysis book ""The rise of Carry"". Which demonstrates that older FOREX carry trades were replaced with a SPY/Vix carry trade.

Thus with Vix at these values, SPY cannot go higher. The explosive downside potential is already astronomical.

And this is just one (albeit a strong one) sign of many others that the market top is near.
[deleted] Maybe Op is buying and needs us to sell? Good luck with that theory.

VIX is around 16. In secular bull markets, VIX can go lower. In 1995 VIX averaged around 14 and the *high for the entire year* was 16.99.

When VIX spikes it is certainly not a ""bear market"" signal. It may indicate normal, expected, and healthy volatility in a bull market.

That said, I'm glad to see posts like this. The more who think the market is about to crash, the higher it will go. Stop beating around the bush. Just tell me when to sell everything. Is it today? See above post... [deleted] The VIX is below where it was in in 2019.  Just monitor share repurchase agreements when they slow/stop then panic!

1m5otcm,2025-07-21,"Selling almost everything but bonds. What I'm keeping.
Sold today, CCJ

Selling RIOT, MSTX which were my bitcoin exposures.

Possibly keeping TMC (which I believe in the Deep Sea mining tech). But It's hard to keep something so volatile as a deep sea mine, mining is hard enough.

Will most likely keep:  
JEPQ (I see no reason not to just hold and DCA).

F (Such a good cost basis that I think I'll just keep it as is).

MO

PFE

HRZN (A risky but good historically dividend payer. It risks lower NAV due to IPO drought which will only get worse, but it has a great basket of companies it does private financing with).

TLTW  
TMF (which are my bond exposure, not principal secured).

I have direct bond ownership as well, so I moved over all of my:  
NVDA, MSFT into direct bond ownership at 170 and 500 prices respectively.

This market is just a clown show. People said ""earnings are better now than before"" but they actually aren't. The earnings are ""better"" because of a declining dollar. Which is fine, but that's not the same as ""PE is good"".

The market is grossly over valued going into an earnings recession at best. At worst we get a massive housing crisis that crushes earnings for 30% of the US economy, and a debt crisis that crushes earnings for MSFT, NVDA, META, GOOG, AMZN, etc.

The two halves of the economy that usually plays one off the other are both staring at their own disasters.

What I will buy later.

JEPQ after QQQ corrects (whatever that looks like).  
GLD if 20% drop in gold.  
Bitcoin at $80,000 to $90,000 this cycle.  
CCJ if a 30% or greater correction.  
TMC (if I sell) if it drops to 200day.  
KO if dividend yield reaches 3.3%  
CVX (oil exposure) if I can get a 7.5%+ dividend yield.  
MO at 7%+ Div yield but not stacking right now.

In rate cuts I'll be flipping my TMF/TLTW into mostly TBT and just sell covered calls on that to keep a good cost basis until the next rate hiking cycle.

1m5o8uc,2025-07-21,"Another reason to sell this *top*
Come August, the $SPY will be 23% higher than it was Aug 2024, but on declining earnings. And earnings will continue to decline going into rate-cuts. The market appears to be calling ""Trump's bluff"" on tariffs, and not behaving rationally. It made sense in February 2025 that we could go a bit higher. And that the April sell off was an over reaction.

But now this is just becoming banana-zone ridiculous blow-off top status in everything.

Southern Company is trading almost at a 50 year low on dividend yield, which is nonsense because Southern Company has NOTHING to do with the ""electricity utility Ai thesis"" that is supposedly driving the high valuations in Utility companies. Instead we are just in an ""everything bubble"" where valuations are absurd and has nothing to do with Ai or Bitcoin or ""cash on the side"" or anything.

It's a classic blow-off top leading into rate cuts. Which means it's more likely to do with Dealer hedging which drags price higher in this case. 

I just moved all my CCJ uranium affiliate over to Bonds (TMF and TLTW specifically). I didn't even wait 1 month for the ""long term capital gains"" because I think in 1 month CCJ will reverse and bonds will rally, negating all the savings a long term capital gain would trigger.

The market usually times itself like that, and because August/September was a good time to buy, CCJ is bound for a crash into August/September as the market denies long-term holders an exit.

Easy trap if you ask me.

As for the broader market. SPY to top out into August makes sense so I'm continuing to add shorts on SPY, SO and KO. My break evens using options are still above the current prices of all three so that's a good short.

I'll add to oil shorts and XLE shorts when the front months start to roll off for me.

I haven't seen this kind of banana-zone rally since 2000s, except its built on even flimsier earnings and higher R\* real-rates.
USD just lost around ~10% of value. So earnings and growth will have a tendency to look good on paper if reported in USD. Timing the market = recipee for failure PE of the the S&P500 has been increasing with relation to the value of the S&P500 so earnings are improving.  Currently we are up 8.3% from the 200-day MA which is not all that much considering.   With that said we are overbought in many areas.  Fundamentals must improve to justify the high price. How many shares have been taken off the market because of share buybacks? It's not a fixed, static system. 

How many companies are still doing share buybacks? Maybe.  But USD has also devalued quite a bit since a year ago. Look at the bond rates. Markets are up but it's not right to think it's the same ""value"". ""This time it's different...""

I spent 2 years doing VOO and chill in my ROTH and individual, but during the tariff stuff, I started putting money into individual stocks. I bought TSLA, NVDA, ASTS, and most recently OPEN. Everything has gone up so fast that the % of my account in VOO has decreased from about 80% to around 50%. Should I reallocate? I know I happened to catch a good time in the market, but the gains sure have been nice. It's tempting to veer from the straight and narrow here, but what % do you guys normally allocate to your ""safer investments"" vs your individual stocks? 
100% ETFs that are tied to the overall market 98% etfs and 2% individual stocks for me to scratch that itch and remind myself that I am not smart enough to beat the market in the long term. > what % do you guys normally allocate to your ""safer investments"" vs your individual stocks?

100 and 0 respectively. for me the perfect ratio is 100:0 There is no % of individual stocks to funds that universally makes sense. It has to be situational because it depends on the specific investments and the reason you chose to allocate some portion to individual stocks.

Most people wouldn't be comfortable with like 15% in individual stocks. Another thing to consider is how they effect your overall allocation. For a well diversified portfolio, if the individual stocks you have are all us large cap then that would count against your s&p500 allocation.

Ex if your overall target allocation is 10% fixed income, 30% international, 10% us smid 50% us large cap, and 20% of your total is in individual stocks loke nvda and appl then you'd only want 30% in voo. That means you have like 1/3 of your us large cap allocation in a single company. yes sir, I got a big loss holdings individual stocks holding long-term then realizing I can't beat the market forever Yes, that's one of my concerns as well, although some of it is in a ROTH so I dont pay short term gains in that right?

1m5lggx,2025-07-21,"Investment Advice for ROTH IRA
Hello, I am 25 and am looking for advice on my Roth IRA. 

Currently own VT, FXAIX, and SPY. 

Looking for an aggressive investing strategy to maximize gains since I am still young, and wondering if there is any overlap between my three positions.

  
Thanks!
Pick one. FXAIX, VOO and SPY all track the same thing, S&P 500 Index. I'd go with cheapest. I personally use FXROX in my Roth, Total Market w/0 ER. Your allocation doesn’t make sense. FXAIX and SPY both track the S&P 500 so get rid of SPY because FXAIX is cheaper (0.015% vs 0.09% ER).

VT is a global index fund so it already includes companies in the S&P 500, so you can either go 100% VT or 100% FXAIX. I'll check it out, thanks! Seems like more risk is associated with FBTC but could work with my investing strategy. Why FXAIX and SPY? Just go 100% FXAIX or VT.

Until your portfolio starts to get close to $100k, the amount of money you can save and contribute every year will make more difference than anything. The sooner you can max contributions for a given year, the better! Basic advice is to research what you’re buying before you do so. Use basic search functions here or elsewhere to learn about what these ETFs actually are VTI (gives you total US stock exposure) instead of VOO. Few stocks with S&P 500 are trading at stretched valuations for quite some years. This usually means below average performance going forward.

1m580dz,2025-07-21,"What sectors are you bullish on for the next few years?
Lately stocks like NVDA, AMD and TSM have been on a strong run. Everyone seems focused on AI chips, data centers and anything related to compute power. I’m wondering what other sectors people are watching going into the next few years. Are there any areas you think are still under the radar or worth positioning into before they take off? 
Nuclear power and fuel.  A resurgence 50 years in the making is happening now.

Global infrastructure especially data centers and logistics.

Digitization of finance, FinTech, and bringing the unbanked, rural, and impoverished into the global economy.

AI-driven disruption and productivity of certain industries like legal and medical advice, advertising, content creation.

The health care industry in the US is an unmitigated disaster and I feel that some company is going to come in and disrupt, plunder, and fix it. Might be Amazon might be someone else but few industries in the world are more ripe for streamlining and disruption. I’m a healthcare worker, and I think it is most likely that our industry will simply continue to be plundered by middlemen until nobody wants to be a medical professional anymore. All the money is in insurance and bloated administration. I don’t think anyone can come in and “fix” it without destroying the insurance industry, and good luck with that. Space and Defense Sector. I would say Minerals but it’s kinda effy to hold in a long term perspective I doubt anyone can guess what the next AI is but Nuclear in general seems to have a brighter future these days than before. At least here in the US.

Ironically to power AI haha Energy

Cybersecurity

AI  & Robotics

Cloudstorage

Clean Energy ( I still have doubts on this one )

Aerospace & Defence (especially EU based companies) Brining in the unbanked, rural and impoverished … these a fine social justice goals, but since we are on an investment sub let’s be real.  These are not served today because there is no money in serving them, so hardly a growth opportunity. I don't think people fathom the robot revolution that's coming. There's a bit of hype but as soon as they really start selling that's going to be a whole other level. I’m a pharmacist, and so far Amazon pharmacy seems to be a flop. It has been very slow to get off the ground. If Amazon bought an insurance company and started price gouging the little guys, then they could become a giant parasite on the industry like CVS Caremark. The reimbursements for prescriptions are tiny and sometimes negative. It then becomes a numbers game and a dick swinging contest between large players. It is almost like an insurance cartel. We actually lose money on each GLP-1 (Ozempic, Mounjaro, Zepbound, etc) we dispense. So these revolutionary weight loss and diabetes medications are basically hot potatoes that pharmacies try to transfer away so someone else eats the cost. Then there are insurance audits, where the insurance companies try to find creative ways to steal money back that they already paid you.

1m4vf34,2025-07-20,"Should I be investing into an index tracking fund or actively managed account?
I have about $100k invested in an actively managed account with JPM. Should I just be putting all of that into an index tracking fund? When I first started investing, I thought someone managing it would be safer, but I never talk to those people and I could obviously invest fee free myself. Is that the way to go?
Index fund is almsot always the answer because the active management fees kill you. Unless you’re soemone who will freak out when the market dips and you need someone to talk you down from bad decisions you don’t need an active rmanager Putting aside the fact that the mgt fee often negates any actual gains achieved, why would you pay someone to buy  an index fund (which is already passively managed by the fund managers) when you can simply buy it yourself  and cut out the middle man? Cool no worries Would you believe that anyone could be so confident in broad market index funds being superior to any actively managed fund that a *1 million dollar* bet was made?

This isn't really relevant.  The top performing active funds over the past 5 years typically are NOT in the top quartile in the next 5 years.  The fact the fund outperformed yesterday does not suggest it will tomorrow.

But >90% of active funds will underperform their relevant index over a 10 year period.  There is no way to pick out the 5-10% outperformers in advance, and they don't seem to occur any more frequently that what you would expect by random chance. I’d look at what’s been the return of your actively invested fund versus the S&P accounting for management fees. The majority of people on here will tell you not to use an actively managed fund but to use a boglehead strategy. What do you pay? How much do add to it? How often?

Hey everyone,

I just finished putting together a **deep-dive due diligence** on AbCellera Biologics (ABCL), covering its entire journey from 2012 to today. This document includes:

* A detailed history of the company and its founder Carl Hansen
* Analysis of their business model and key partnerships
* Insights into their proprietary pipeline and royalty-bearing programs
* Financial performance and growth trajectory
* My personal perspective on their long-term potential

The goal was to create a **thorough and objective resource** for anyone interested in ABCL’s story and future prospects. I relied on a wide range of publicly available sources and, since English isn’t my first language, I also used AI assistance to refine the writing and ensure clarity.

If you find any factual inaccuracies or areas that could be improved, please let me know. I’ve been reviewing it multiple times, but I’d gladly update it based on community feedback.

Everyone had their opportunity to buy on a major dip only a few months ago.

Also, PLTR on a list to buy on a dip? Unless it dips 70% I’m good. Probably just VTI Not one of those None.. if u like this list than buy voo. I dont trust large caps and their growth doesn't match my portfolio personally. Many on this list are over valued. Most notably is PLTR Every single time there is a major dip in the market caused by some major news people come to the investment subs saying this is the start of the entire market meltdown and it’s unlike any other dip that we’ve ever had. 

What they don’t get is that the dips are ALWAYS different. The dot com crash, housing bubble, COVID, tariffs, etc are all different but the market always recovers. 

Maybe one day it won’t recover but history has taught us that it’s always worth it to buy the dip so far. So is this presuming that you have cash set aside to buy the dips? Costco Yeah. Same feeling with the forward PE and analysts who are saying it's a good buy. 
My feeling is they have lost it on the creative SaaS market. Newbie creators are using canva and designers have moved on to figma etc.,. The tiktok crowd isn't using Adobe products anymore.

1m49n0n,2025-07-19,"Is this a good start to my investing journey?
I’m thinking of starting by splitting my investments 3 equal ways between VOO, SPY, and VTI. I’m 19 years old and hoping to eventually be getting a 10-13% annual return and hopefully retire around 35 years old. Is 3-3.5 million enough to retire? Any help is very much appreciated!

Great that you’re starting early, BUT you're basically buying the S&P 500 three times. VOO and SPY track the same index, so that's just redundancy with different expense ratios. VTI adds a little mid/small-cap, but not much new exposure. Ditch the duplicates and diversify globally if you're serious (= add something like VXUS). Also, 10-13% per year? Good luck. Check this breakdown of your allocation: https://www.insightfol.io/en/portfolios/report/738484f21e/ That's like going to the ice cream shop and getting a scoop of homemade vanilla, french vanilla, and vanilla bean.  Doesn't make any sense.  It's two S&P500 funds, and total US market fund (which is like 85% S&P500).

Keep VTI, and add an international fund like VXUS, in a split anywhere from 60/40 to 80/20.  Or just buy the global stock market in one click with something like VT. The three way split seems pointless. Just stick to VTI. I would add international too. 3-3.5 million might be enough to retire at the age of 35 in a random city in North Carolina for example. Not enough to retire in San Francisco. So, it depends. That's only one factor to consider in your calculations, albeit a big one Those 3 funds are more or less the same thing (VTI is weighted by market cap, so it is largely composed of the stocks in VOO/SPY), so just pick one of them. 

After several years of historic returns, the US market is severely overvalued and poised for a decade of poor returns (i.e. a big crash followed by a return to more normal growth). You would do well to put some money in something like VEA or VIGI (international large cap growth/blend) or VWO (emerging markets) so that your portfolio better weathers a downturn.

Investing in lower-performing but lower-volatility equities, and regularly rebalancing between them during downturns, actually leads to *better* long-term performance - you can do some simple backtesting online using different mixes of VOO, VYM, and VIG to convince yourself this is true. You should use actual historical returns and learn how to factor for inflation. 

You would need to save $120k a year for the next 16 year, at 7% real return, to get to $3.5 millions at 35. I think it's quite optimistic to expect 10-13% annual return from broad market indices. Also, don't forget inflation. 5-7% is probably more realistic. As other’s already said 3 stocks you listed are similar so pick one.  


Lookup historical performance of any of the stocks you listed (Past is no guarantee of future performance).  
Whatever average % they returned yearly is what you can estimate.

  
if you want to retire at 35 you have 15 years to make your target (3-3.5M)  
Remember today’s 3.5M is lot less 15 years from now due to inflation.

  
There are plenty of tools to tell you if the money is enough or not.  
Fidelity has a great retirement tool. It takes into account inflation, rate of return (3 scenarios better than average, average, worse than average), detailed budget in your retirement lifestyle etc. It runs Monte Carlo simulations and gives you a table showing when you will hit your target and will it last rest of your life. I agree with everyone here but you don’t need VXUS at the moment. It isn’t the 20th century, the largest “US” companies have expanded all over the world. When you buy Apple you are buying into international markets by default because you have Apple products sold worldwide. A typical 3 fund approach is what I would go with such as VTI SCHG QQQ Awesome thank you a lot!

1m3zww7,2025-07-19,"anybody investing in these 10%+ dividend yield ETF's?
Ok so recently I came across a few a few actively managed ETF's providing some crazy dividend yields and I was wondering if anybody has a LARGE majority of their market investments in them

SPYI - 12% dividend yield  
QQQI - 13.80%  
JEPQ - 11.30%

These are relatively new, so I assume theyre a little riskier than traditional index fund investing, so thats why I had to ask.
I have clients in qqqi and spyi, the dividend yield rates is accurate.

If your your primary objective is monthly dividends, QQQi is fantastic. If your primary objective is growth, QQQ is the significantly better. I think you're suppose to put money into them not clients. You investment people are an odd bunch. Just retired, got JEPQ, JEPI, GPIX, GPIQ, SCHD, VIG, VOO, SGOV to collect some monthly passive income.  Still have some growth funds but adjusted right before retirement to about 50/50 now It is a sacrifice worth making. I like QQQM for long term growth because of the lower expense ration Money is fungible, at the end of the day it doesn't really matter if your ""passive income"" source is dividends or if it's capital gains from appreciation/growth.  In fact, it's more tax efficient to fund your retirement on capital gains rather then dividends (that being said most earnings from dividend funds other than JEPQ/JEPI are qualified so the difference is nonexistent, and you should be funding your retirement from tax-advantaged accounts anyways).

If you're married filing jointly and only pulling a combined ~$120k in SS + capital gains + all other income you're actually in the 0% capital gains bracket, whereas unqualified dividends would be taxed at income tax rates. JEPI and JEPQ are not at all new, their distributions rise with volatility. You trade growth for income with them, and depending on where you pay taxes the taxation may be unfavourable or zero (eg in case of their UCITS counterparts in some EU countries). They are really good at what they do, but are not for those who’re still in the accumulation phase. If one consumes the distributions their growth is essentially zero.

Personally can’t wait for the day I plug everything into them. $ULTY Probably selling covered calls. What’s the benefit of dividends over growth for total return? I.e. in what situation would you choose dividends over owning growth and just selling periodically?

Hi everyone. I live in  Turkey and  I have a long term investment plan  I dont want to be a stock guru so all of my investments will be  ETFs.  my aim is to maximize growth overtime and when its time for retirement I will park the bus to relatively safer assets my portfolio exposure contains of Turkey,US and EU ETFs. I'm planing to reallocate basket 2 times a year based on market conditions

here is my current allocation

\----------------------------------------------------

VTI : 25%

VGT: 25%

IIE: 15% (Turkey's hedge fund)

IIH: 35% (Turkey actively managed stock fund)

\----------------------------------------------------

Thematic ETFs:  15% of overall portfolio  this category allocation and ETFs tends to change more frequent than overall basket

HRZ:  34% (Turkey IPO ETF)

EUAD: 32% (Europe Aerospace and Defense ETF)

MSTY: 32% ( don't judge me I have great entry point on this one its  is my best investment so far lol)

\----------------------------------------------------

Crypto: %10 of overall portfolio

BTC: 50%

ETH: 50%

\----------------------------------------------------

Commodities/Money Market: 10%

NAU: 60% (Turkey's precious metal fund)

40% (Turkey's money market fund)

I'm open to any suggestions. My current strategy is that I will keep the base structure (for instance current allocation)  and then I'll start decreasing risky assets overtime until retirement
Are you in turkey or from turkey and is the Turkish funds in the Lira or another currency?

I don't remember reading that Turkey's stock market was doing that great, I wouldn't be putting money into a small geopolitical country that has an inflation rate north of 30% but thats just me.

My strategy would be to get my money out of the Lira and out of Turkey. Etorro and Interactive brokers European divisions allow Turkish citizens to open brokerages in Europe, says google.  

I can't say I'm anywhere near an expert on whats going on in Turkey or their financial markets but I'd take that 10% commodities and buy physical gold and silver rather than holding it. I live in Turkey and yes you are correct I wouldn't want to put my investment into Turkish lira but I dont have too many options unfortunately, nonetheless a lot of  actively managed stock funds in Turkey actually beat  SPY and NASDAQ in the pass.

1m3q1fa,2025-07-19,"How is my portfolio looking?
I’ve been trading investing for a couple years, mostly just trading. This is my first time truly buying to hold. I got around 500 invested currently in my account and with 100 in cash to do some risky plays with. I’m leaning to leveraged etfs for the most part due to my low capital size.

I’m holding NVDA, RIOT, MSFT, SPY, SOXL, SPXL, QQQU, GS, JEPQ, SCHW, BITX, TNA, LBRDP, KMI, CVX, VICI, AAPL, and KKR. 

Thinking of adding 30-50 bucks a month to keep my port growing. 

How am i doing?
Nah bro, just do 100% SP500 stop trying to be the next stock picking guru. Your money is so little that it doesn’t even matter what you do at this point. You need to focus more on getting your money up. College/trade school/military/business what ever it is focus on the income. Probably worse than 100% VOO Just sell the whole thing and buy 100% VT and you’ll suddenly have a perfectly allocated portfolio. 

No need to overcomplicate it. As others said, just go 100% on S&P 500 or an all world passive ETF, keep adding every month and forget about it.

If you haven't heard of SPIVA, look into it. If the overwhelming majority of professional traders with all their resources, working long hours full time can't beat the market it is close to impossible for you to do so.

If you really like trading and you want to ignore the empirical research - find your niche, a sector you want to follow, really do your research and allocate 10-20% of your total investment to trading. What do you think is materially going to change in a week? You have to shift your time perspective for investing. You should be looking to buy stocks or etfs and hold them for years. At the very least until you can get  long-term capital gains so you aren't hit too badly by the tax man. You have no Hedges for those Volatile LETFs and others. Gonna be hurting severely next Bear market.

SOXL is not even positive over last 4 years. Yet if would understand the Math, could have made over 1,000% harvesting the Decay. I’d give it a solid D+. 

Better than buying random penny stocks, but over leveraged towards individual companies and bleeding cash to leveraged funds. 

You’ve achieved a lower expected return (thanks to leverage bleed / expense ratios) than a diversified index fund with about 1000x the drawdown risk. 

In the context of the Modern Portfolio Theory “Efficient Frontier”, you’d be about a mile off the chart to the right on the x-axis.

Exponentially high risk with lower expected return. 

TLDR: Liquidate everything and buy one properly diversified total world equities fund like VT. It’s $7 per $10k invested to align yourself perfectly with global market weights.

not happy with gains and high fees! close to 600$
a year Roth IRA account
Got rid of my financial advisor today after I was not happy with gains and high fees! close to 600$ a year Roth IRA account

As the title says I ended up getting rid of my financial advisor which I had for four years. I was getting charged quite a bit in fees seems like every 3 months I was being charged 150 to $180 for his Services also he had me invested in multiple ETFs which were not performing as well as I thought they would. I was only up about 12% after 4 years on total gain.  This is a Roth Ira btw

My question is - I'm trying to sell off all these bad performing ETFs that he had me invested in and invest in basically a two to three fund Etf portfolio. 

So far I have bought since selling other etfs 80% in vti and 20% in fbtc

Any reason to add a third etf? 

Also the best performing etf he had I kept so far is Spyg. Which I'm up 35% in 4 years. Should I hang on to this or sell and buy more vti? I'm 32 years old

Thanks for any advice. I believe I did the right thing. 
12% after 4 years in this environment is criminal. Your new setup is clean, but 20% in FBTC is a pretty heavy Bitcoin tilt for a Roth unless you're super high conviction. SPYG overlaps a lot with VTI, so probably redundant. What I'd think about is adding some international exposure (e.g. VXUS). Check this report on your allocation: [https://www.insightfol.io/en/portfolios/report/e112e6637c/](https://www.insightfol.io/en/portfolios/report/e112e6637c/) For anyone with under 10 million investment asset, they don't need anyone. Fees were high and gains were not impressive. Why would I keep him? Ding ding ding. Everyone knows what to do in the gym but some can’t get their ass in and do it without a trainer.

A good financial advisor is valuable for those who may make emotional decisions with money. wrong - every day we hear about folks telling they sold during covid or this year and lost a lot of money not being in the market. This guy without advisor might end up in one or two years taking stupid decision at the wrong time. A majority of retail investors are hugely and badly underperforming the market. Op speaking about $ for the fee instead of %, wanting to invest 20% in BTC, and not speaking about benchmark for his investment is showing he might end up even worse without advisor. That was clear from the post. You fired your financial advisor because of performance and fees with the plan to ask reddit instead? 

Shouldn't you've have asked your financial advisor to review your investments and adjust your allocation to align with your goals? It all depend. What was the benchmark? how old is Op? S&P500 has been up 45% in 4 years, but if you had Bond and International, with a conservative risk, it’s where he might have end up.

I started investing like half a year ago 15k$, i investing almost everything at s&p 500 , recently i started buying nvidia, google , uber, shopify .
But still the largest part is s&p, i want to invest for long term and im kind of new to trading with single stocks, i would like to get advice and help because im trying to learn and im happy if you can comment what do you think
VTI or VOO. Set it and forget it, and then thank yourself 30 years from now. So currently thats kind of what im doing, like google nvidia, even shopify is working with ai I got a 1 banking etf also i forgot to add it, im a lil afraid of crypto, i think its too risky to me The first step to **investing** is humility. You are not smarter than the market.

What you're describing is gambling. Which is fine, and you can make a lot of money. Or lose it, too.

At a minimum, fund your Roth IRA first and use that money for the safe VTI/VOO investments. I see, lately i followed after etherium, i saw it was pumping and it sorr of a short squeeze, i missed it anyways, if i will try to go into that world of crypto a lil what you think i should do , i heard about solana also, but take in mind that i wint invest a lot into it but probably less than 10 % Thx for the opinion, ill take it into consideration Etf VOO and more VOO. Focus on well positioned AI stocks, and companies you believe will stick around the next 10-20 years.
MSFT is a good one. Stable. Like you are talking about buying more etfs, like qqq? Maybe add some banking in there. I’d have at least one stock or an ETF.

1m39pgt,2025-07-18,"Thoughts on what I should do.
I invested a chunk of money a while back and hadn’t added to it in a while. Marriage, two kids, etc. 
what should be my next move? I have some cash on hand to add, but I feel as though the gap of where my averages are and where the market is just doesn’t make sense to add right now. 

Averages:
 
Spy: $413.70
Google: 95.25
Amazon: $104.42
Apple: $146.08
Apple is struggling to increase revenue (and have actually been decreasing since 2022), the other two will most likely keep increasing revenue and see their stocks go higher. Google is actually valued quite low. SP500 is generally considered a good bet with a good risk to reward profile. VOO or QQQM, set to auto weekly. Work to increase your weekly. That’s all you can do. 

What you’re doing is falling in love with basis. Tons of people have 300-1200% return with little baby bags. 

Had they just DCA’ed they would have a TON more money. Don’t rely on self discipline, set to auto. Work to increase auto. Best of luck. VOO for S&P, replace Apple with NVDA or MSFT. 
Amazon is a safe play too. Decent portfolio Well, let's start with some basics: what are your financial goals? Or rather, what are life goals for you and your spouse, and what will it take monetarily to get to them? 

(If you haven't talked about these things, Money for Couples is a great book with a helpful framework.) Just get a world index like VT. Makes investment decisions off of your averages doesn’t make sense Index funds seem smart.  Buy them in small increments over a six month period.  Then don’t look back.  In ten years, you’ll be very happy!

Put money (somewhat evenly) into: 
1) S&P 500 Fund (SPY, VOO, VUG, IVV)
2) QQQ (nasdaq 100 fund)
3) BRK-B (Berkshire Hathaway)
4) Blackstone (if more risk seeking)

Then pick a couple individual stocks if you must (but understand, the funds above own a ton of AAPL, NVDA, MSFT etc).  You’ll own them by default without the daily risk of something hitting any one company.  

That said, a lot of people have made a ton of money just staying in the Mag 7, lol.  Who knows! SPY ETF is by far your best of the choices. The other S&P 500 ETFs mentioned by others are great, as well. I'm not aware of a company named Spy so I'm assuming you meant the ETF, however that is selling around $600 presently It makes zero sense.

1m39cub,2025-07-18,"Just reached $1000 in my US portfolio (US investment is around 10% of my total portfolio)
I’m a 27M Indian and I have around 10% of my portfolio invested in the US market, half VT and half Google for now. Planning to dump more into Nvidia if it dips, else continue VT and chill. My returns just crossed 10%, leading to $1000 US portfolio value. I just started a job after an MBA last year so I have been investing regularly for a year now. 

I have around $9000 in Indian index funds and gold bonds. I know $10k isn’t much for most people here, but it’s a big amount in India and I’m pumped to finally reach $10k invested. 

Since I’ll most likely be retiring in India, I’m not going to focus more than 10% of my portfolio on international diversification. Can’t wait to reach $100k now. Baby steps. I’ll get there sooner or later as long as I spend less than I earn and invest the rest. 

People who’ve spent years to reach $100k and above, I’d love to know your experience! 
True but investing in US comes with forex transfer costs and taxation issues. Foreign investment from India is highly restricted and getting dollars converted to rupees is a big hassle. Which is why even though a depreciating rupee means a US investment is doubly beneficial, most Indians don’t go that route for the majority of their portfolio. 

Also, I work in India, in case there’s some confusion. If I were working in the US with a US bank account, I’d have invested 90% in VT and 10% in stocks. Why does retiring in India mean limiting international exposure? Genuinely curious. I would think regardless of where you retire, you invest where you expect to get good returns.  Interesting feedback. I was curious as I'm sure I suffer from home country bias and it's interesting hearing another perspective.  I’m mostly a boglehead, around 90% of my portfolio is either index funds or gold bonds. So I don’t do much analysis on individual stocks. 

That disclaimer aside, I currently only own shares in CDSL and BSE. I bought both at dip, and the former is at 50% gain right now and BSE is at 5% (bought it a week ago when it dipped 20% from ATH). Any indian company you are bullish on? Correct me if I'm wrong, 10k USD in India would be the equivalent of 2 years salary right? If so that's pretty good! India's version of the SP500 also outbeats most of US indexes the past 5 years. Over the past year it did dissapoint though. Realise that there is a market shift going on since Trump administration that might get reflected in a couple of quartes/years. Loads of governments (mainly Europe) aren't only steering away from dealing with US, but will also start taxing ad revenue from companies like Google and Meta. https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vt Maybe Consider Charles Schwab: they open international accounts. Minimal fees. Hi ther. 31M here.

1m2by4h,2025-07-17,"TSMC just crushed Q2. Here’s why I’m still holding (and glad I bought the dip at $145)
I’ve had TSM in the portfolio for a while now (wrote a deep dive on it ages ago which still holds up). Earlier this year, when everyone freaked out over tariffs and the stock dipped to \~$145, I flagged it as a chance to load up. I bumped it to over 5% of the portfolio.

Fast forward to Q2 2025 earnings …yeah. No regrets.

The numbers slapped:

* Revenue: $31.67B, up 54% YoY 🤯
* Net income: $9.2B, up 60%
* EPS: $2.47 (beat by $0.16)
* Gross margin: 58.6% (up big from 54.1%)
* Full-year revenue growth now expected to hit 30% (up from 20% earlier)

The stock popped. And it should’ve.

What’s driving it? AI. Lots of it.

TSMC’s HPC segment now makes up 60% of total revenue. That’s up from 52% last year. Meanwhile, smartphones are just 27% of the pie now.

The 3nm node is 24% of wafer revenue already. That’s up from 15% last quarter. Nvidia, AMD, Apple, etc. are all over it. The 5nm node is still king (36%), but 3nm is catching up fast.

Revenue from the U.S. now makes up 75% of total sales. China? Just 9%. So much for “dependence on China.”

Earnings call had some juicy bits too:

Biggest Q&A themes were:

1. Can TSM actually keep up with all this AI demand?
2. When are AI customers moving to bleeding-edge nodes like 2nm and A16?

Management basically said: yes, fabs are ramping, we’re good. And yes, AI clients are *absolutely* moving to the newest stuff sooner due to power efficiency. These data centers eat electricity like crazy. CEO said the biggest constraint for AI players is power. A16 (coming 2026) is supposed to be 20% more efficient than 2nm, which already beats 3nm.

Also, about 30% of their future advanced node capacity will be in Arizona, not Taiwan. That’s a pretty clear signal they’re hedging geo risks.

Couple other things:

* Q3 rev guide: $31.8B to $33B.
* FX headwinds (strong NT$) hit margins a bit, but they still see 53%+ long-term gross margins.
* Capex for 2025: \~$40B.
* They called out tariffs and weak consumer markets as risks, but AI growth more than offsets that

If you  want more details on my TSM thesis, I wrote a full deep dive back in March (with way more context, valuation, risks, etc):

[https://www.beatingthetide.com/p/tsmc-stock-why-this-semiconductor](https://www.beatingthetide.com/p/tsmc-stock-why-this-semiconductor)

1m1y10k,2025-07-17,"Is a dot com bubble kind crash possible again?
Hey guys. When I used to look at charts of spy, qqq. I used to look at different time periods and they were all mostly positive with great returns. 2007-2025, 2013-2025, 2002-2025. All worked out great. 

Until recently I accidentally zoomed out a little bit more. And found that if you had bought qqq in 2000, it would have taken you 15 years to breakeven. That's a lot of time. Even for spy, even though it broke even at around 2007, it crashed immediately after finally started giving profits in 2013. 

Was wondering if you guys think such downturns are possible again. And what would you do if it were to happen. Coz buy and hold would be really challenging in this scenario for most investors. 

Now wether it might happen, I am not sure. But I Iooked at P/E ratio of nasdaq 100 and it's around 32.5 and forward p/e is 27.5. and comparing with the the 2000 period, it was around 80-100. What would you guys say that has fundamentally changed in the market that there can't be decade long drawdowns anymore. 
Can you not assume that over a long enough period (5-10 years) stock markets go up?
Yes. Next question  You can’t time it, if you’re scared and wait around, you can possibly miss out on substantial gains

If you’re nervous, hold shares for long term and then hedge & buy a few puts as insurance for if things go down substantially If you zoom out till 1990, you will see that QQQ made a 800% gain between 1995-2000.This was greed and  based on highly overvalued internet companies who made little profits.today nasdaq 100 is much better balanced between sectors. Also the mag7 companies also make good revenue, high nett profits and yearly growth what explains their high PE valuations. This also pushes up sp500 PE’s. So comparing today’s PE with 20 years ago and conclude we market is overpriced doesn’t make sence. The higher PE’s in growth companies will stay.  But can a 50% drawdown happen again in the future? Yes it can, when we would have high valuations and a bear market starts together with some other world event,.. QQQ dropped -30% in 2020 covid crash, -34% in 2022 bear market,.. if something else would have tumbled down when QQQ sat at -30% more downside would be possible The old saying is that history does not repeat but it does rhyme.

The conditions now are not as crazy as during the dotcom boom and bust.   Valuations are high, but not  nearly as crazy as in the late 1990s.

There will be a pullback most likely, but not anywhere near as severe IN 2000.

I unfortunately had a tech heavy portfolio at the beginning of 2000.  The good news is that I knew it was funny money as my portfolio had quadrupled in the last 3 years before the bust,   I was selling and rebalancing, but not fast enough.    What we have now does not have the same crazy feel as 1997-2000. I love the idea of OP “accidentally” zooming out to 2000. That must have been quite a surprise to see there were more candles! To elaborate:

* The Stock Market's ""Market Cap"" right now is based on vast majority of people holding and a few people trading.
* If an event happens that requires majority of stock owners to need more liquid than they accounted for, this could trigger a large sale event reducing all prices across the board.

TLDR: If enough people think that they need to sell stocks at the same time, boom. They aren't just possible, they are almost certain to happen again at some point.

Buy and hold is very difficult during those markets. That is why it is vitally important to have at minimum 3-6 months emergency fund so that you don't ever have to think about needing to liquidate anything from the market while it's down.

If you're closer to retirement, then you should bump that up to about 12-18 months of an emergency fund so you don't have to touch your portfolio for a while. Thanks. It’s the snake you don’t see that bites you War.

I’m a moderately conservative investor, I don’t have much time to research stocks. Most of my IRA is in ETF’s or NVDA. For my rainy day fund I got into Nvidia (120 shares avg 117) during the tariff dip, and that’s been great, I regret not doing more. I have about 40k sitting there. I thought about a HYSA, someone suggested ULTY, but that seems fishy and I do t fully get it. I was thinking some other AI or tech plays. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
If this is an emergency fund it should not be invested in the market. [deleted] SGOV. Get used to DCA, then increase your auto. You’re hurting yourself. Man's up 24% Year in nvda instead of 4% money market. You're right that it's not ""properly invested"" for a emergency fund. You could also argue that he got lucky and this was a far better place to keep it.

I'd probably sell nvda and put it into sp500 or money market now, or a mix of both For 40k and easy access, get SPAXX at Fidelity. If you want 'safe', use VUSXX treasury-based money market that is state tax exempt if you report the dividends correctly.   If you want 'diverse', use VT (or VTI for just US funds). So if you're down 30-40% because the economy is trash and you, in turn, loose your job you would rather sell those investments likely at a loss instead of have cash set aside? \> Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

1m1e6ci,2025-07-16,"For stock held by ETFs & Mutual Funds, who votes in shareholder meetings?
(Maybe meta question related to investment but hope it is allowed).

I suddenly realizing that since switching from holding individual stock that I no longer see proxy vote invites.

I don't think that my votes for my 100s of shares was meaningful nor well informed when I was voting directly, and in many cases I just ticked ""voting with board recommendations"".

However with an EFT owning a significant (and growing) stake in companies, are there any rules for how they should vote?  Or is there a risk for a ETF manager suddenly becoming an activist?  

The flip side if ETFs has rules for voting with board, would that not quickly add up to over 50% of votes and if so what would that do to shareholder accountability ?
It depends on the fund manager. 

In the US - investment managers have stewardship committees which are required to vote in the best interest of their shareholders. 

Some investment managers also have proxy voting processes so that fund shareholders can vote - for example Vanguard and Blackrock and SSgA;

[https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/about-us/investment-stewardship/blackrock-voting-choice](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/about-us/investment-stewardship/blackrock-voting-choice)

However even if this becomes the norm I am guessing most people will not vote, you would get hundreds of proxy votes usually on boring stuff like picking an auditor .

However here is a guideline on how vanguard will vote, and its not really just rubber stamping the BOD, its to vote in the best interest of the shareholders but that gives them lots of leeway and its not totally defined



[https://pcg.law.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/5-Vanguards-proxy-voting-guidelines-\_-Vanguard.pdf](https://pcg.law.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/5-Vanguards-proxy-voting-guidelines-_-Vanguard.pdf) I’d prefer the fund manager to vote. I never vote on my shares. I figure the fund managers are smarter than I am and our interests are mostly aligned (increasing the size of the fund) so I have no issue blindly putting my trust in them. If they miss their benchmarks they’ll eventually get fired. As long as they stick to the fundamentals objective as stated in the prospectus, I don’t really care what decisions they make, I just want to maximize total return.

Would you risk your job and reputation in an industry just to make a political statement? Probably not.

1m19rzv,2025-07-16,"J.P. Morgan and Bank of America are in talks with Other Major Banks about a jointly operated Stablecoin Project run on Ethereum
J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America are both exploring cryptocurrency and stablecoin initiatives, signaling a potential shift in how traditional banks approach digital assets. J.P. Morgan has launched a digital deposit token called JPM Coin, and is piloting a new USD denominated deposit token called JPM D for institutional clients. Bank of America is also reportedly advancing its own stablecoin plans. 

J.P. Morgan already uses JPM Coin built on the Ethereum Platform for its wholesale payments business, and recently reported it now handles over $1 billion in transactions daily.

They are also reportedly planning to allow clients to use cryptocurrency-linked assets, including Bitcoin ETFs, as collateral for loans. (This is huge)

Bank of America is reportedly exploring the development of a stablecoin and has accelerated its blockchain strategy recently. 

They are also reportedly becoming more crypto-friendly, with CEO Brian Moynihan stating the bank has to enter the stablecoin market as soon as possible.

But the most important part of this news is... both J.P. Morgan and Bank of America are reportedly in talks with OTHER MAJOR BANKS about a JOINTLY operated stablecoin project which will soon take place after the ""crypto-vote"" passes by the House Of Rep's this week.

Are these SOME the reasons why ETH and XRP have been running much higher?
Why do they need the blockchain for that?

It is not like it make transactions faster or cheaper. Safer? Maybe. Anonymous? Unlikely.

They are just chasing the dumb money hype.

Satoshi Nakamoto is spin on his grave. This must be giving the XRP fanboys an aneurysm, why would major banks adopt an off the shelf product controlled centrally by a for-profit company when they can just build their own on ethereum? I mean circle's stable coin has something like 60 billion coins, thats 60 billion dollars in deposits , and no interest on those deposits

If people are willing to deposit money at zero % interest , any bank would want to get in on that. They will likely use a rollup over Ethereum, like RobinHood [1] or Deutsche Bank [2] are doing. A rollup is its own blockchain but settles cryptographic proofs on Ethereum which allows it to derive its security from Ethereum's consensus mechanism. Rollups use the Ethereum layer 1 for settlement and pay ETH to do so.

The advantage for these banks is that rollup transactions are very cheap and rollups can be incredibly fast, reaching thousands of transactions per second. They also have full control of the rollup, so they can be permissioned walled gardens. But they settle on a shared credibly neutral network. So interbank settlement goes from D+2 to a cryptographic proof posted on Ethereum the next  block (12 seconds).

This is the first technology where both the dollars and the other assets are on the same ledger which enables a speed otherwise not possible. Stablecoins also can be accessible to a much larger audience that doesn't have access to US banking services. The government likes them because with the Genius bill they have to be backed by treasury bills which reinforces US dollar hegemony. Take your pick, there's reasons for government, the businesses, and retail. Blockchain is just an interoperable public open source protocol, like TCP/IP. 

So instead of a multi day settlement between JPdatabase and BoAdatabase, they just update the ledger entry on the Ethereum protocol. 

People are just used to thinking money can only exist in proprietary intranets and not the internet because a solution for enforceable scarcity hadn't been solved for when Internet Protocol was invented. They are building a L2 on the Ethereum blockchain. What do you mean with ""they are not in investing in ETH blockchain"" ? It's not necessarily that ETH is used in the rollup to pay for transactions. That's a possibility, and many public rollups do it like that but private rollups can also decide to abstract it away. Transactions on a rollup may be free or paid in a stablecoin. 

It's the rollup itself that pays ETH to settle its proofs. The rollup lives on top of the L1, to include its proofs in Ethereum it must pay ETH. Think of rollups as applications on Ethereum, they are the users of Ethereum and they pay for it. My USDC at Coinbase gets 4.1% currently. 

I think banks will compete with sharing some of the interest if you hold it on their platform just like they do with CD's or anything else. 

They want you to do your banking there so that you use them for other banking products. Maybe I'm cynical, but i read this as banks looking to create their own ""company store"" scrip.

1m117vv,2025-07-16,"Seeking portfolio optimization advice rolled over Ira

Hello,
I recently rolled over approximately $15,000 from my previous employer's 401(k) into a Fidelity IRA. My goal is to build a strong, long-term growth portfolio by evenly investing in stocks, with ongoing monthly contributions.
Here's my initial allocation breakdown for the $15,000:
 * Technology/Growth:
   * Microsoft (MSFT): $2000
   * Apple (AAPL): $2000
   * NVIDIA (NVDA): $1,500
   * Amazon (AMZN): $1,000
   * Palantir (PLTR): $1,000
   * Snowflake (SNOW): $1,000
   * Super Micro Computer (SMCI): $1,000
 * ETFs (Tech-Focused):
   * Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ): $1,500
   * VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH): $1,500
 * Consumer/Healthcare/Staples:
   * Visa (V): $750
   * Costco Wholesale (COST): $750
   * Procter & Gamble (PG): $1,000
   * Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): $1,000

My Objectives:
 * Long-term capital appreciation.
 * Diversification across promising sectors/companies.
 * Consistency with monthly contributions.
Questions for the Community:
 * Given my initial selections and goals, do you have any suggestions for optimizing this portfolio?
 * Are there any particular stocks you would add, remove, or adjust the weighting of?
 * Are there any sectors or types of companies I might be overlooking for a ""strong portfolio""?
Any insights or recommendations would be greatly appreciated as I look to build a robust investment foundation.
Thank you!
 
Are you willing to diversify more? And how about utilizing leverage in the form of LETFs?

You’re already very concentrated in tech so it would reduce idiosyncratic risk if you just roll over your individual stock picks into QQQ. The tech stocks already have high  growth rates  baked into their current pricing.

Unless you think you are smarter than the overall wisdom of the market I suggest just getting the overall market average return by buying low costs broad market ETFs such as VTI/ITOT/SCHB total US stock market ETFs and VXUS/IXUS international stock market ETFs.

Yes, boring.   But in investing boring is sometimes the best. Solid start tech-heavy but full of winners. I’d maybe dial back a bit on overlap (QQQ + MSFT, AAPL, NVDA) and consider adding financials or industrials for balance. Monthly DCA will go a long way! Most of your money should not be in individual stocks, and this is not diversified. I am open to any suggestions and look into them.

Please share more info (: Thank you so much for your suggestions.

You’re right. I’ll be looking into these.

I def want to make a smart decision with this. Which one do you have on your mind I’ll look into them !

Thank you! You should look into gold, managed futures, and treasury bonds for diversification across asset classes. If you are young you should only allocate a small percent of your portfolio to these.

You can employ a TQQQ 200SMA strategy or just buy QQQ only instead of picking out individual stocks to reduce individual stock risk. I am 37 and my wife is 29

We started a business which grew big and we want to start investing for the future especially now that we have a 3 years old and want to make sure we are in good hands when we are about 55-60 If you are risk-averse I would not recommend leverage. You can expect to stomach a drawdown of 50% of your invested assets sometime in the future should you choose to employ the 200SMA TQQQ strategy, but of course it comes with great reward to the risk.

1m0yc2h,2025-07-16,"I know you're not supposed to time the market but should I wait until after Trump's tariffs on August 1st to invest into VOO
And should I pull my invested money out before then and then put it back in after the stocks tank?

I really don't know what I'm talking about I just heard tariffs August 1st and don't want to lose money like when the stocks tanked in April. I know they'll always go back up but wouldn't pulling out then going back in after the dip make more sense?

Okay thanks for the replies I understand now, don't time it. Second question what should I put my money into, VOO/S&P/ Google?

“I know I am not supposed to time the market, but should I time the market”? it might not even go down Still very risky, I'm waiting after world war 3 as thats the biggest dip I mean this in the nicest of ways but


> I know I'm not supposed to time the market but should I try timing the market?


That's all I saw in your title Literally no one says it will. If you had said the same thing anytime between his first major tariffs announcement and now you'd have missed out on all time highs. You make your money in the stock market by ALWAYS being invested and riding out the bumps, not by asking people on reddit if it's right to time the market. There are several reasons why timing the market is typically a poor decision:


1) Odds are you're young (and by that I mean anything below like 40). This means that your investing time horizon is like 20-30 years. The tariff thing will be like one day two weeks from now. Trump's presidency itself will only be another 3.5 years. Your portfolio will outlive these things. Other presidents will be elected. New technologies will be invented. Paradigms will be shifted. The key to successful investing is to tune out the noise.


2) You know about Aug 1. That means everyone else knows about it too. That means that everyone has already taken it into account, and the prices today already reflect it as if today is already Aug 2.


3) 100 different things can happen between then and now. A deal can be struck that convinces Trump to repeal the tariffs. Trump could delay them again. Companies could report they are doing well despite them. An amazing jobs report or CPI report could come out. Rates could be lowered. Etc, etc. You don't have a crystal ball and you have no way of knowing what will truly happen in the next two weeks, two months, two years, or two decades.


4) Prices of stocks (over time) are not determined by what is happening in the world today. They are determined by people's best guess of which companies or industries will prosper in the future.


5) 2024 was an _incredible_ year for the stock market overall, yet from January to May, [all the gains were attributable to just 9 days.](https://archive.is/5wnT9) It is highly unlikely you would have been able to perfectly figure out which 9 days those were in advance to know when to keep your money in and when to take it out.

1m0yb0u,2025-07-16,"27 years old stocks or real estate $100,000 Capital
I can get a $400,000 loan from the bank to invest into real estate using my $100,000 as collateral. My plan was to buy 5 homes, put a tenant into each and make passive income.

Or I can open up a IRA and put the $100,000 into a ETF like SPY. Which one is more likely to give me better returns? There is also a 401K but I'm not sure which one is more beneficial. 
Buy the 5 homes! But do you have the trade skills to be a landlord? And the charisma/people skills? And be firm when it inevitably comes time to evict? Always one problem tenant… Where are you getting 5 homes for $400k though??  Assuming they would be rent ready You can't put $100,000 into an IRA, there is an annual limit, even if you're self employed. 


Also, 5 homes? With $400k down? Sounds risky as shit TBH.  5 homes isnt just going to be 400k stop. Do you have the money to support taxes/utilities/repairs/mortgage/ rental insurance. What if no one lives in them will you manage to make the payments on the building without the income for several months? 

If you are going into this blind start with one rental property. There's no way this can fail! yes, my family works in real estate and they offered to help. This! Bitcoin's CAGR is 50%. If you think real estate will render you more then by all means go with real estate. If not, BTC is the obvious choice considering the almost null overhead compared to real estate. You can only put $7k into an IRA per year. 

You usually cannot contribute directly to a 401k; it has to come out of your paycheck. Real estate is not “passive income.” How it was labeled that way I have no idea. You have to deal with maintenance, repairs, rising property taxes and insurance costs, tenants not paying and their extensive rights, lawsuits, property damage, and other stuff I’m prob forgetting. How is that passive?

Also ask yourself: am I investing for income or growth? If you’re 27 you should prob be thinking growth so you can set yourself up for retirement. In that case it’s easy: max out tax-advantaged accounts like HSA, Roth IRA, 401(k) and if you still have money to invest open a taxable brokerage account. SPY is fine and mix in some IEFA for Int’l,  VB for small cap, and IEMG for emerging markets. I wouldn't in vest in growth index funds.  These funds have a tendency to not have any returns or very small returns. Sometime for several years in a row in long bear markets.  I would rather invest the money in QQQI 13% dividend yield.  This would earn you 13k a year of income,  And if you reinvest all of the income you will have 200K in about 5 years.  Or if needed you could turn off auto reinvestment and  in a month money from the dividends will appear in your account and you can use that car as you wish.",0,0.32,16,0,Snoo_60933,investing,['SPY'],27 years old stocks real estate 100000 capital get 400000 loan bank invest real estate using 100000 collateral plan buy 5 homes put tenant make passive income open ira put 100000 etf like spy one likely give better returns also 401k im sure one beneficial buy 5 homes trade skills landlord charismapeople skills firm inevitably comes time evict always one problem tenant getting 5 homes 400k though assuming would rent ready cant put 100000 ira annual limit even youre self employed also 5 homes 400k sounds risky shit tbh 5 homes isnt going 400k stop money support taxesutilitiesrepairsmortgage rental insurance one lives manage make payments building without income several months going blind start one rental property theres way fail yes family works real estate offered help bitcoins cagr 50 think real estate render means go real estate btc obvious choice considering almost null overhead compared real estate put 7k ira per year usually cannot contribute directly 401k come paycheck real estate passive income labeled way idea deal maintenance repairs rising property taxes insurance costs tenants paying extensive rights lawsuits property damage stuff im prob forgetting passive also ask investing income growth youre 27 prob thinking growth set retirement case easy max taxadvantaged accounts like hsa roth ira 401k still money invest open taxable brokerage account spy fine mix iefa intl vb small cap iemg emerging markets wouldnt vest growth index funds funds tendency returns small returns sometime several years row long bear markets would rather invest money qqqi 13 dividend yield would earn 13k year income reinvest income 200k 5 years needed could turn auto reinvestment month money dividends appear account use car wish
1m0rxui,2025-07-15,"No circle-jerking, Honest to heart questions: Why would a seasonal investor choose Dividens over income-based-strategies Options?
Why do some investors prefer dividend investing, which offers modest income (e.g., \~$3,400 post-tax on $100,000 at 4% yield) plus growth through stock appreciation, over the Wheel Strategy, which generates significantly higher income (e.g., \~$39,750 post-tax on $100,000 from weekly option premiums), despite both strategies benefiting from potential stock price growth? Additionally, could using margin to amplify capital (e.g., borrowing 50% to invest $150,000) meaningfully boost returns for either strategy, and if so, why might investors still hesitate to leverage margin for these approaches?

You may argue about ""set and forget"" but you guys are on a subeditor that discuss investing, I feel like you wouldn't mind the extra work. Also some values may not be accurate reflection of current price.

# Math Breakdown

* **Dividend Investing (Without Margin)**:
   * **Capital**: $100,000.
   * **Yield**: 4% (e.g., diversified portfolio with ETFs like VYM or stocks like JPM, KO).
   * **Annual Income (Pre-Tax)**: $100,000 × 4% = $4,000.
   * **Tax**: 15% federal on qualified dividends.
   * **Post-Tax Income**: $4,000 × (1 - 0.15) = $3,400/year.
   * **Growth**: Potential stock price appreciation (e.g., 7% annually) + dividend growth (e.g., 5–8%/year).
* **Dividend Investing (With 50% Margin)**:
   * **Total Capital**: $150,000 ($100,000 cash + $50,000 borrowed at 7% margin rate, typical for brokers like IBKR).
   * **Annual Income (Pre-Tax)**: $150,000 × 4% = $6,000.
   * **Margin Interest**: $50,000 × 7% = $3,500/year.
   * **Net Income (Pre-Tax)**: $6,000 - $3,500 = $2,500.
   * **Tax**: 15% federal on dividends.
   * **Post-Tax Income**: $2,500 × (1 - 0.15) = $2,125/year.
   * **Growth**: Appreciation on $150,000 (e.g., 7% = $10,500/year pre-tax).
* **Wheel Strategy (Without Margin, HOOD Example)**:
   * **Capital**: $98,340 (10 contracts, 1,000 shares at $98.34/share).
   * **Premium**: $98/contract/week (30-delta puts/calls, 10 contracts = $980/week).
   * **Annual Income (Pre-Tax)**: $980 × 52 weeks = $50,960.
   * **Tax**: 22% federal on option premiums (ordinary income).
   * **Post-Tax Income**: $50,960 × (1 - 0.22) = \~$39,750/year.
   * **Growth**: Potential stock appreciation if assigned (e.g., HOOD price increase).
* **Wheel Strategy (With 50% Margin, HOOD Example)**:
   * **Total Capital**: $147,510 ($98,340 cash + $49,170 borrowed at 7% margin rate).
   * **Contracts**: 15 contracts (1,500 shares at $98.34/share).
   * **Premium**: $98/contract/week × 15 = $1,470/week.
   * **Annual Income (Pre-Tax)**: $1,470 × 52 weeks = $76,440.
   * **Margin Interest**: $49,170 × 7% = $3,442/year.
   * **Net Income (Pre-Tax)**: $76,440 - $3,442 = $72,998.
   * **Tax**: 22% federal on option premiums.
   * **Post-Tax Income**: $72,998 × (1 - 0.22) = \~$56,939/year.
   * **Growth**: Appreciation on 1,500 shares if assigned.
>which generates significantly higher income (e.g., \~$39,750 post-tax on $100,000 from weekly option premiums)

This is an illusion - there is no way to consistently earn 51% yield on an investment. If you can generate $57k in income from $100k then you don't need to argue why other people aren't doing it. You would give absolutely zero fucks. And yet here you are... Your math is woefully incomplete.

Options aren't free money. Your puts will be assigned sometimes, and then you will lose money. And then when you sell your calls, they will get called away and you will lose upside. The combination is such that you wind up earning less running the wheel than if you just held the underlying.

This is both true in theory (because you would expect a fair market to price options fairly, and you are making a risk-off trade) and in practice (you can look up simulations of wheel performance and see that it tends to underperform simple buy-and-hold). Or, if you only want to look at half the picture, you can just look at the historical performance of a call-selling ETF like XYLD vs. SPY. That's quite a jump! The wheel strategy is a great way to pay a ton of taxes and miss out on upside. It’s also way, way more work than just owning a stock. I have a full time job, I don’t have the time or desire to trade options and monitor my positions.

That’s also why I like stocks over real estate. I don’t want to put the effort in. 

But seriously, the risk that your shares get called away and you miss out on a sharp move up is too much for me to stomach.  You can’t raise that argument being the OP.  Foul!  You’re outta here!!!!!!! Not to mention the OPs example concentrates his entire position PLUS 50% leverage in Robinhood stock - a highly speculative and volatile company prone to huge swings, historically. A big price move against him, especially with all that leverage, could damn near wipe out his position. His whole premise just assumes Robinhood is rangebound which is absurd. If you can predict stock movements better than the market, then you will beat the market. It doesn't matter if you do so with options, shares, futures, etc. If you start from the assumption that you have an edge, then you can succeed in a number of ways, and there's no real discussion here.

If you *can't* outguess the market, then you can in fact say which approach gives higher returns. The highest long-term expected return will come with the highest risk. The person selling options is getting a lower-risk trade, given that they are getting a guaranteed payment upfront, while the buyer is making a risky trade buying something that might not pay off at all. All else being equal, the option buyer is not going to do so unless they expect to win that bet, on average. Meaning that they will gain more money in the long run through averages.

And since you're on the other side of that bet, that means you are *losing* money on average, relative to the option buyer. This doesn't mean you lose money overall, but rather that you are earning less than the underlying security will return by itself.

In a purely market sense you would say that neither approach is 'superior'. One is making a lower-risk, lower-return move (option selling) and the other is making a higher-risk, higher-return move (option buying). If you prefer stability, then you can get it, at some cost of higher returns. It's the same idea as adding bonds to your portfolio. It's not worse, just different. I can do that. It wouldn't involve investing and would be illegal and...


It's basically Breaking Bad... Robinhood has extremely high implied volatility, which is why the options premiums are juiced. If you used an index fund or a boring mature company stock, the premiums in your example aren’t even remotely possible. And again, your example completely ignores swings in the underlying stock price - which could wipe out your capital especially when highly leveraged and concentrated in a volatile stock. A volatile stock with high IV is not going to be rangebound, which is the optimal scenario for an option wheel strategy.",0,0.38,45,0,Tinominor,investing,['JPM'],circlejerking honest heart questions would seasonal investor choose dividens incomebasedstrategies options investors prefer dividend investing offers modest income eg 3400 posttax 100000 4 yield plus growth stock appreciation wheel strategy generates significantly higher income eg 39750 posttax 100000 weekly option premiums despite strategies benefiting potential stock price growth additionally could using margin amplify capital eg borrowing 50 invest 150000 meaningfully boost returns either strategy might investors still hesitate leverage margin approaches may argue set forget guys subeditor discuss investing feel like wouldnt mind extra work also values may accurate reflection current price math breakdown dividend investing without margin capital 100000 yield 4 eg diversified portfolio etfs like vym stocks like jpm ko annual income pretax 100000 4 4000 tax 15 federal qualified dividends posttax income 4000 1 015 3400year growth potential stock price appreciation eg 7 annually dividend growth eg 58year dividend investing 50 margin total capital 150000 100000 cash 50000 borrowed 7 margin rate typical brokers like ibkr annual income pretax 150000 4 6000 margin interest 50000 7 3500year net income pretax 6000 3500 2500 tax 15 federal dividends posttax income 2500 1 015 2125year growth appreciation 150000 eg 7 10500year pretax wheel strategy without margin hood example capital 98340 10 contracts 1000 shares 9834share premium 98contractweek 30delta putscalls 10 contracts 980week annual income pretax 980 52 weeks 50960 tax 22 federal option premiums ordinary income posttax income 50960 1 022 39750year growth potential stock appreciation assigned eg hood price increase wheel strategy 50 margin hood example total capital 147510 98340 cash 49170 borrowed 7 margin rate contracts 15 contracts 1500 shares 9834share premium 98contractweek 15 1470week annual income pretax 1470 52 weeks 76440 margin interest 49170 7 3442year net income pretax 76440 3442 72998 tax 22 federal option premiums posttax income 72998 1 022 56939year growth appreciation 1500 shares assigned generates significantly higher income eg 39750 posttax 100000 weekly option premiums illusion way consistently earn 51 yield investment generate 57k income 100k dont need argue people arent would give absolutely zero fucks yet math woefully incomplete options arent free money puts assigned sometimes lose money sell calls get called away lose upside combination wind earning less running wheel held underlying true theory would expect fair market price options fairly making riskoff trade practice look simulations wheel performance see tends underperform simple buyandhold want look half picture look historical performance callselling etf like xyld vs spy thats quite jump wheel strategy great way pay ton taxes miss upside also way way work owning stock full time job dont time desire trade options monitor positions thats also like stocks real estate dont want put effort seriously risk shares get called away miss sharp move much stomach cant raise argument op foul youre outta mention ops example concentrates entire position plus 50 leverage robinhood stock highly speculative volatile company prone huge swings historically big price move especially leverage could damn near wipe position whole premise assumes robinhood rangebound absurd predict stock movements better market beat market doesnt matter options shares futures etc start assumption edge succeed number ways theres real discussion cant outguess market fact say approach gives higher returns highest longterm expected return come highest risk person selling options getting lowerrisk trade given getting guaranteed payment upfront buyer making risky trade buying something might pay else equal option buyer going unless expect win bet average meaning gain money long run averages since youre side bet means losing money average relative option buyer doesnt mean lose money overall rather earning less underlying security return purely market sense would say neither approach superior one making lowerrisk lowerreturn move option selling making higherrisk higherreturn move option buying prefer stability get cost higher returns idea adding bonds portfolio worse different wouldnt involve investing would illegal basically breaking bad robinhood extremely high implied volatility options premiums juiced used index fund boring mature company stock premiums example arent even remotely possible example completely ignores swings underlying stock price could wipe capital especially highly leveraged concentrated volatile stock volatile stock high iv going rangebound optimal scenario option wheel strategy

I've looked through quite a few but haven't found really want I'm looking for.  
I like Koyfin since it is the most affordable Bloomberg-like software. Though it might be a bit overwhelming at first if you haven't used financial software like that before. They also don't have research so you will need to source that from your brokerage or somewhere else. Yet to find a one stop shop. I use Yahoo Finance, Fidelity, and the Stock Events app. Try download, desktop IBKR if is available in your country it’s a broker app very useful with so many tools, and it’s for free. If there was a platform that was geared to the investors to do their own research’ and do it like the big boys and had a built in learning guide like Duolingo built it. Is this be something you’d spend $20/ month on?

I don’t care how close you are with your mom. One layoff from a job and she will take that money to “keep the lights on.”

Money breaks a lot of relationships up. You should be paying those, you are old enough to do your own taxes. You have no legal right over that account or money as it is right now. Close the account and open one in your name. He right on that, you want YOUR money in YOUR name There’s no fees to having your own account. Taxes only come on gains so if you don’t sell you don’t pay taxes. You can also use your realized gains to pay off those taxes. As for benefits: Full legal control, no complications around ownership, you’ll learn more, freedoms to use the money how you please. Stay the furthest away you can from options 100% Open your own account. Put majority of your money in an ETF. I’m 23 and personally like SCHG the most, it’s large cap US growth companies. You’re young so you want to look at growth companies. Then you can pick a couple individual stocks that you like. If not just throw it all in SCHG to keep it easy. Depends on the type of account. But either way you should be able to get the money tax/fee free. If it’s an individual brokerage under solely your parents name then they can either keep or sell the stocks and gift you the money (up to 18k a year tax free) if it’s a joint account you can work with the brokerage to make if fully yours. I don't think that Robinhood supports custodial account. It should have been opened as a custodial account at a broker that supports it. It would have been more tax efficient. 

Doing what you suggest creates a tax complication for you and your mother. 

You may want to just keep it simple and have your mom close the account and give you the proceeds. And you can reimburse her for the tax burden on the gains. I’d definitely open my own account now at 18 — just feels way better to have full control and not worry about tax stuff in someone else’s name.

1m0j15t,2025-07-15,"Deep ITM Put Credit spreads
What's the catch? Right now, I have 10 put credits spread on SPY 607/606 that expire 7/31.

Each one is giving me a credit of $13. Yes, I am aware I am risking $100 for $13. I look at the market every day to see if I need to manage any of my positions. The month of July tends to be a green month. With that being said, I feel very confident in this position and do not mind waiting 15-20 days to receive my $130 credit. So, what am I missing? This feels too good to be true of a trade.


I guess that I'm not sure what you are asking. Your spread is not itm and it's not deep.

Are you asking what happens when your spread goes itm?

SPY is currently trading at $625.

Call contracts less than $625 are itm. Call contracts more than $625 are otm.

Put contracts more than $625 are itm. Put contracts less than $625 are otm.

You said you had a put credit spread of 606/607 - that is less than $625.

So your credit spread is otm.

If both legs of the spread goes itm - you incur max loss.

Also - not sure if you tried to use an alt to respond to me - but this strategy using a put credit spread is a reasonable trade if you believe that SPY will be flat or increase in the next 2 weeks.

There is always early assignment risk - but I don't think that will occur unless there is a dividend event in the next 2 weeks. And these are puts - not calls. A whole lot. These are about 20 delta puts - you are not really deep itm. The spread reduces the position delta so it may seem like it's deep. 

But it's a regular bull put spread with a pretty normal P/L.  Credit of around $13/contract with max loss of around $88/contract.

Don't fool yourself that it's deep. It's not. Use XSP or SPX, not spy. The early assignment risk is real 

It looks like people are telling you what's going on. You're pretty much playing a casino game with five squares. One is red and four are green. You say I'm going to bet on Green, okay you can make a little money but your risk is landing on that red 

So there's an extremely high probability you will make money on this trade. But if you do it over and over and over and over the question is how long before you hit red? 

Like you can make some money with this strategy and people do it, it's just kind of questionable what the yearly returns will wind up being SPX options are european style options and cash settled. There is no early assignment risk. Now I am even more confused. 607/606 range is not ITM on SPY? Spy has early assignment risk for the ITM puts you wrote. 

SPX may be better for strategies that include ITM short options because it lacks this risk. Wouldn’t I still get assigned on SPX? Correct - that is max loss of \~$88/contract that I mentioned. 

Not sure that I understand your question.

Are you familiar with the P/L curve of a bull put spread at expiration?

\[edit\] - oh - I see why you are confused. I wasn't clear. You are not ITM. What you described is not ITM.

1m044z8,2025-07-15,"RVHP.  This biotech company has high potential to make us rich!!

Company Overview

Reviva Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: RVPH) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapies for central nervous system (CNS), respiratory, inflammatory, and cardiometabolic diseases. Its lead candidate, Brilaroxazine (RP5063), targets schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders, with promising Phase 3 results and an NDA filing expected in Q3 2025 A B.

Investment Thesis: Why RVPH Is a Strong Buy

1. Promising Drug Pipeline

• Brilaroxazine has demonstrated robust efficacy across multiple symptom domains in schizophrenia, including negative symptoms, with low adverse event rates B.
• Additional indications under development include bipolar disorder, depression, ADHD, Alzheimer’s psychosis, pulmonary hypertension, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis A.
• The company is also advancing RP1208 for depression and obesity.


2. Analyst Ratings & Price Targets

Metric	Value	
Consensus Rating	Strong Buy C D	
Average Price Target	$9.00 (+2200% upside) C D	
High Target	$17.00	
Low Target	$3.00	
Analyst Coverage	5 analysts, all bullish D	


Brokerages like D. Boral Capital and HC Wainwright have consistently maintained buy ratings, citing undervaluation and strong clinical data D E.

3. Undervalued Market Cap

• Current Market Cap: ~$18.8M F
• Book Value per Share: $0.02 F
• Price-to-Book Ratio: 19.6 (suggests overvaluation on assets, but justified by pipeline potential) F
• Cash Position: ~$5.3M as of Q2 2025 G


Despite a steep drop in share price (down ~78% YTD), the valuation does not reflect the upside from Brilaroxazine’s NDA and potential commercialization.

4. Insider & Institutional Confidence

• Insider Ownership: 27.18% F
• Institutional Ownership: 63.18% F


High insider and institutional ownership signals strong internal and market confidence in the company’s trajectory.

5. SEC Filings & Financial Discipline

• Recent 10-Q (May 2025) and 10-K (April 2025) filings show disciplined R&D spending and strategic capital raises to support clinical milestones H I.
• The company completed a $10M public offering in June 2025 to fund operations and regulatory submissions B.

Risks & Considerations

• Cash Burn: Negative free cash flow of ~$18.5M TTM G.
• Regulatory Risk: Approval of Brilaroxazine is not guaranteed.
• Dilution: Frequent public offerings may dilute shareholder value.
• Short Interest: ~10% of float sold short, indicating bearish sentiment F.

Strategic Catalysts

• Q3 2025: NDA filing for Brilaroxazine in schizophrenia.
• Q4 2025: Potential FDA feedback and partnership announcements.
• 2026+: Expansion into respiratory and metabolic indications.

Conclusion

RVPH presents a high-risk, high-reward opportunity for investors seeking exposure to biotech innovation. With a strong clinical pipeline, bullish analyst sentiment, and significant upside potential, RVPH is positioned as a speculative but compelling buy for those with a tolerance for volatility and a long-term profit!
Pump? Dump? I have to ask how 200 percent tariffs are going to hit pharma stocks.

Also - as a reminder - analysts research cited in this post is from D. Boral Capital and HC Wainwright.

The ratio of the S&P 500 Index to the S&P 500 Equal-Weight Index—a measure of U.S. market concentration—has historically hit around 20% before every recession in the past 40 years.

That ratio is now once again nearing 20%, sitting at a historic high.

Keeping eyes on NVDA, AMD, TSLA, BGM, PLTR, CRCL recently. 
Markets never had access to liquidity like today. Everybody and their mother can buy stocks off their phone which was unheard of 20 years ago. That plus buy the dip mentality and a fed that prints at the first sign of trouble means multiples will probably stay higher than normal moving forward. Only time will tell though. Lets see your short position. Anyone and their mother can also sell stocks off their phones fyi This time it’s different  Thank you, but to be clear, that post was purely sharing an observation about that specific concentration metric hitting a historically significant level – not a declaration of my personal trading book. No active short positions tied to that post here.

I know this comment could be downvoted, but I still have to say that others' opinions are always blurry to your own investments, the best choices are only on your own hands. We can discuss with each other about the technical or fundamental. The ones who ask you to go long or short could be a fraud, or pumping and dumping shit. let’s see paul allen’s card The line going up can continue to go way up. There’s actually a recession right now, but this time it’s a recession in buying power.

1ml84x2,2025-08-08,"The timing release of gpt5 suggests to me Altman knows this Market is going to crash
I tagged this as fundamentals due diligence due to the fact that I have researched this 

Sam Altman released gpt5. I have used it quite a bit and I find it to be much better than previous models. However, the very first time I asked it something I actually knew it gave me the incorrect answer. I asked about the local housing supply and I even told them what websites to look at and they got it wrong by 40%

That makes me question just how much information they gave me. That wasn't correct that I didn't know factually before I asked. 

Hallucinations apparently have dropped from 33% to under 5% with gpt5 that is excellent! That is a great improvement 

However Sam Altman, I am sorry that is not PHD level 
Physicists like Edward Whitton and Neil Tyson degrees don't make make mathematic mistakes 5% of the time they make them Less than 1%. 

By releasing 
Gpt5 in this current economic environment where the CPI data could spark a sell-off next week, Altman knows the valuations have gotten far ahead themselves? And when asked this morning on squawk box when he was going to start seeing an roi he said I don't know. We're just going to keep building until we aren't making any more progress. So he is going to spend another trillion dollars to improve that 5% mistake rate to under 1% and that lasts 4 percent is going to be the hardest 4% they've ever scaled. 

Now how does this have to do with tying into the market? 
Well currently currently open AI is worth something like 300 billion but is valued at 500 billion in terms of market valuation. Meaning his employees can sell shares if they were eligible today knowing that there is going to be a pullback before they the company is actually worth half a trillion dollars 

This would allow the employees to walk away with a paycheck and then head over to meta or Microsoft or Google. Ees here's the catch. The employees can't sell their shares until January 2026 at the earliest ... So if Sam Altman is smart as smart as me and I'm sure he is. Lol. He is going to make sure that the valuation of his company is not worth it to his employees to walk away at that moment. Cuz a sell-off in shares from his employees and walking away could be disastrous for open AI 

However, if he has devalued the other companies in the market as well because of oversaturation or pushing them so fast so far that they fail or run into major hurdles the lure of going to other companies would not be that exciting. Meta will for sure face another antitrust lawsuit Altman just needs to wait that out 

Anyways that's just my take. I like to look at things in layers because I don't understand why he rolled out such a crappy version of gpt5. It would be like the iPhone rushing out a supercycle a iPhone that had chat GPT5 on it. But they aren't going to do that because that's not th this is not the peak moment for Apple to capitalize on the AI Revolution and people can finally see that Apple is going to capitalize on it
Where you buy your crack cocaine? Seems be very good quality Altman has no idea when the market will crash You are new to this stock market thing I see lol. seriously. or a manic episode They just created a liquidity event for employees that valued the company at 500 billion.

1mk7k21,2025-08-07,"If PLTR goes to become $1T from here, you will gain only 100%
What would you do -

Bought when it was $8/9. At this point, my cost basis is 0 because I also made more by selling covered calls than I invested in PLTR stock. So, as I have nothing left to lose on PLTR out of pocket, I am trying to figure out whether and how to exit.

So....

If PLTR grows to become $1T from here, the gain from here would just be 100%.

The valuation is so rich, that continued growth in revenue will be required at much higher rate than what NVDA had during its bull run ( from $400 to $1T was done between 2022 to 2023). Some data pulled by chatgpt -

https://preview.redd.it/nb2pn6hc1nhf1.png?width=939&format=png&auto=webp&s=1141d8f57bbf37e7f93956b5d792ee4b7bcb79f1

.

**And if 'AI' is the reason for PLTR's bull run, it seems highly valued compared to that of NVDA during same phase.**

At this point, it has started to make sense to book profit and reinvest in future dips. That's my reasoning based only on simple SP and growth numbers.

Any other longs contemplating this ? What's your theory if you have decided to exit/continue to hold at current SP ?

Also, if you are thinking to buy PLTR NOW, what's your theory and what are your realistic expectations?

not advice. dyor.

Edit - Update. I exited 90% and keeping 10% in PLTR. Also, have a **speculative small position** in PLTZ (inverse/short 2x PLTR), going to keep adding upto certain limit only and then hold. Will eat up some of my realized profit from PLTR, but it ""feels"" :) PLTZ can likely give 100%+ sometime in the future. Just a speculation. Not advice.  
Not gonna say this means you should or should not invest in PLTR, not gonna check your math.

Only gonna say that is GOOD to check out market caps when thinking about investing in something, particularly if you have hopes of 10×ing your investment. Sometimes it's mathematically unrealistic (or impossible in a given time frame). If PLTR hits 4.5 trillion, it will be because we’re all slaves in Peter Thiel’s network state fiefdom anyway. Buying palantir is just betting on mass surveillance I mean if you put it like that, i guess imma go buy some Although I agree with you. People were saying it was incredibly unrealistic for NVDA to hit 1T just a couple years ago. Now it’s valued at 4.5T and it’s the most valuable company in the world I've been a high growth tech investor for over 20 years.  While the 48% YoY quarterly revenue growth sounds great, it's not that impressive when the base number is well under $1b.  

Can't claim to be a shareholder, but I do agree with OP assessment that the risk/reward isn't that great at this point.  Then again I would have said the same when the share price was half the current value.  It ""tanked"" to what $75-ish in early April - and I still didn't think it was worth the investment.

The way I look at it is I can make just as much gain if not more on other stocks, where I can sleep at night owning them.  While I do agree that PLTR has a very unique platform offering, I don't see them (at least not at this point) as some one stop AI/data analytics shop for the corporate and business world.  I see the landscape shifting quite a bit in this area with winners TBD, rather than PLTR as some lead innovator.

Stocks such as ZM and RNG sprinted ahead during pandemic era and failed to live up to the hype.  PLTR situation is of course a bit different - but you see what can happen when valuation runs far ahead of performance. Yep I sold apple in 2016 because it was unfathomable a company could get any bigger.  But here we are lol. You have a better chance of gaining 100% in MSFT or Googl Its crazy to me seeing pople invest in their own demise.

Even with all the turmoil and uncertainty the US is still the place to invest.

What are the alternatives? China? Can’t trust their numbers. And you definitely can’t trust their government. Anytime a Chinese company gets too powerful it gets stomp by the CCP.

Europe? Hell no. Way too much regulation. Way too much taxation. Absolutely terrible place to grow a business. 

Brazil? Russia? Emerging markets? Good luck with that.

The USA is absolutely dominating big tech. Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and NVIDIA. And the current administration will let these companies continue their monopolies as long as they pay the president tribute. Which for these trillion dollar companies is a rounding error.

But the dollar is crashing? Nonsense. The dollar is stronger than in 2020-2022 and 2003-2016. Don’t be fooled by propagandists who are pushing a narrative. 


These other countries have one big advantage: they're run by governments that aren't actively trying to destroy their nations. Can we really trust the US numbers much longer though? Trump will just continue firing whoever reports inconvenient facts until every position is filled by a loyalist willing to lie for him. Idk what the alternative is though, I'm still buying US.. [deleted] Yeah because you can totally trust the numbers in Trump’s America.

America is still the place to invest, because of the fact it’s a capitalistic hellhole. The whole system is designed in a way where profits are the only thing that matters. You sound like a typical American who doesn’t even own a passport and has never traveled outside the U.S. Too much taxation in Europe? What are you talking about? Monaco, for example, is tax-free. In fact, many American companies have moved to Europe, especially to Amsterdam, because of better corporate tax rates.

You say you can’t trust China? Well, guess what, China is far more modern than you might imagine. The same goes for Russia. You’ve clearly fallen for Western propaganda and, like many Americans, don’t seem to know much about the world.

Did you know the largest chipmaker in the world, ASML, is based in Europe? Probably not. Some of the world’s largest companies come from a small European country, the Netherlands. Think Shell, Booking, ASML, Philips, Heineken, and many others. Imagine how many more globally influential companies are based there in Europe. It’s a very large Economy. The Euro is also stronger than the dollar. 

Also, why do you only name China, Russia and Brazil as examples. Are those the only countries you could think of?

However I do agree that tech companies in the usa are pretty good investments. Especially Nvdia, palantir, apple, microsoft. Enron says what? I'm invested in Canadian stocks. They have never been higher. Plus Canada faired extremely well during the 2008 recession and the guy responsible for that is currently the Prime Minister. Climate change and natural resources are going to make Canada a world powerhouse in the next 10 to 15 years. Trump is leading the US into a hard fall. The US economy and current fiscal strategy resembles that of the 1920s. And we all know what happened then. And the US haven't learned their lesson and safeguarded against similar future issues. China is poised to easily take the lead in tech. You're kidding yourself if you think otherwise. Same with the EV market. i have my savings in st treasuries and i am at a loss as to what to do now, because as we know trump is going to slaughter that market.   been struggling with this since kugler left.

1mitjqn,2025-08-06,"Google’s new AI model creates video game worlds in real time
Google DeepMind is releasing a new version of its AI “world” model, called Genie 3, capable of generating 3D environments that users and AI agents can interact with in real time. The company is also promising that users will be able to interact with the worlds for much longer than before and that the model will actually remember where things are when you look away from them.

World models are a type of AI system that can simulate environments for purposes like education, entertainment, or to help train robots or AI agents. With world models, you give them a prompt and they generate a space that you can move around in like you would in a video game, but instead of the world being handcrafted with 3D assets, it’s all being generated with AI. It’s an area Google is putting a lot of effort into; the company showed off Genie 2 in December, which could create interactive worlds based off of an image, and it’s building a world models team led by a former co-lead of OpenAI’s Sora video generation tool.
The assumption that something is a video game world, just because it is a digital world, is wrong. Video game assumes it is payable AND fun/horrifying/challenging etc. I wish they had a different term. Such as render game assets. These are cool and all but is there any AI company out there trying to utilize AI to make interactions with NPCs more dynamic and interesting? I don't think randomly generating sloppy graphics or characters is that interesting. I'd rather have a thoroughly thought out vibrant world where my actions and the progress of events cause NPCs to react accordingly and hand out quests or tasks relative to them. Until today I've not seen a well-crafted game with such functions. I think people might be missing the point with these. 

Right now all 3d engines render using lots of triangles. It’s amazing that we can get things to look so good using this technique. 

This is a completely different rending approach. I could imagine things like rendering a forest or tree, which typically are hard to do with triangles use this technique. 

3d engines use something called LOD to render far off objects. They could use this to render much higher resolution background far off in the distance instead of LOD. 

This stuff is very very interesting. Not to mention NPCs which you can talk to like real people - no more ‘I took an arrow to the knee’. Can the assets be transferred to unreal engine? And it should always be in the back of your mind that AI doesn't create it only steals, & restructures. Let's not start with this shit. The Unreal team demos that recently.

Roberts Imperial Court is going to have to do some VERY interesting mental gymnastics. I know you are being sarcastic, but man, isn’t that a shame and indictment of the current court? 

(They will absolutely ignore precedent whenever they want.) It seems that the ""religious discrimination"" is about the bank forcing their wholesome god-fearing employees to work alongside the heretical gays.

That makes sense. There have been similar claims lately about things like porn (it's sex abuse, so we should ban it) and vaccines (also religious discrimination). The snowflake factor that’s overtaken the Republican Party is breathtaking. As if SCOTUS gives a shit about the law anymore. They’re saying republican bias includes not allowing banking to Nazis, aren’t they? 

Trump: protecting Nazis. Is it possible that the ""discrimination"" was based on some sort of credit report 🤔 sounds like George Soros deep state stuff! This is nothing more than a red herring that will allow the Trump admin to simply prosecute anyone they want to.  Basically if you don’t do business as they command, then you are discriminating. Financial Organizations dont like crypto currency companies because they have a bad habit of not following Anti-money laundering laws, and banking them means additional due diligence that those companies inevitably fail. 

When they arent literally just making money by facilitating fraud like elder exploitation.

Most literally cant be banked while remaining in compliance.  

But yeah, its ""political""... Sounds like fantasies of persecution.

1mgif0a,2025-08-03,"Top Politician Trades Breakdown: July 2025 - What Are They Signaling?
Here’s a summary of the top 10 buys and sells by Congress this past month. Some interesting themes are emerging that might hint at what insiders expect in the months ahead.



https://preview.redd.it/vfwou904wsgf1.png?width=1256&format=png&auto=webp&s=caa0e23a3bea2da2a13bb1a53c22445b2bf20ca9

 **Top 10 Buys**

AVGO (Broadcom) - Nancy Pelosi Pelosi’s million-dollar buy into AVGO isn’t subtle. With their recent AI-related chip expansion and VMware integration closing, this may be a bet on long-term enterprise cloud and AI infrastructure growth.

US Treasury Bills - Earl Leroy Carter Classic flight to safety. With markets at all-time highs and trade noise heating up (tariff headlines), this could be a defensive hedge. Interestingly, he also sold Treasuries in the same timeframe. More on that below.

OGVXX (Money Market) - John Rose Another safety play - cash-like instruments are getting love. Could be bracing for volatility, especially with elections nearing and major tech earnings coming up.

BTCUSD (Bitcoin) - Brandon Gill Multiple buys into BTC suggest confidence and possibly anticipating more inflows or a response to a weakening dollar narrative.

University Kansas Hospital Bonds - Suzan DelBene Healthcare muni bonds at this size ($250k–$500k) could be a longer-term interest rate or infrastructure play. Not exciting, but steady.

Los Angeles CA Water Utility Bonds - Scott Peters Another muni. These are low-risk, long-term yielders - could be indicative of a rate peak thesis where bonds get reloaded.

AAL (American Airlines) - Tim Moore Surprising pick given airline volatility. Could be a bet on travel demand heading into holiday season or reversion after summer pullback.

L (Loews Corp), MKL, WTM - James French Hill All three are insurance/financial plays. Might signal expectations of rate stability or cash-generating businesses getting revalued upward.

AAPL (Apple) - Tim Moore Classic long-term hold, but interesting timing with their earnings just around the corner. Potential bet on improved guidance or new AI hype/momentum?

TD (Toronto-Dominion Bank) - Ro Khanna A cross-border financial? Possibly a rate sensitivity play or anticipation of North American banking consolidation.



https://preview.redd.it/f6f1joy4wsgf1.png?width=1254&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3ced532acfcf8b3d2b49632c4d230c2eeb7d91a

**Top 10 Sells**

US Treasury Bills - Earl Leroy Carter Yep - same guy who bought them. This could be a rollover into new durations, but could also suggest shifting allocations as yields peak.

OGVXX (Money Market) - John Rose Again, selling a cash-equivalent here. He may be rotating from safety into something else (or raising cash for new plays). Possibly speculative.

TNA (Small-Cap Bull ETF) - Tim Moore Selling leveraged small-cap exposure after a recent rally might be locking in gains - or reducing risk ahead of election-driven volatility.

SMCWX, AGTHX, CWGIX - John Rose Mutual fund trimming across growth and world funds. This could be part of broader de-risking or tax optimization.

DAL (Delta Airlines) - Dave McCormick Sold just days after earnings. Might be disappointed with guidance or concerned about fuel prices and consumer strength.

MSFT - John Rose A bold sell ahead of earnings. Could be locking in profit or anticipating weaker guidance in AI capex. 

GOOGL - John Rose Same theme - multiple big tech sells pre-earnings. 

BX (Blackstone) - James French Hill PE and REITs are sensitive to interest rates. This might suggest expectations of tighter credit or weaker returns ahead in private markets.

SFNC - James French Hill Regional bank sell - still cautious sentiment in small bank exposure. Heavily affected by rate hikes and CRE risk.

FLL - Susie Lee Smaller cap regional casino operator - likely shedding risk, or expecting slower discretionary spend in Q3.

**Final Takes**

There’s a clear theme of hedging risk and rotating defensively, especially among repeat names like John Rose and Tim Moore. Treasuries, money markets, munis, and even Bitcoin are showing up - each for different reasons, but the common thread may be caution. The big question is: What are they expecting on the macro front? Inflation resurgence? Rate volatility? A tech correction?



The August 1 tariff changes are already in effect, now the real question is how global trade partners respond. Keep an eye on potential retaliation or ripple effects in the coming days. With Jackson Hole just weeks away, any signs of volatility could be early moves from smart money repositioning ahead of the Fed.

1mghvuc,2025-08-03,"How to track live charts with a watchlist?
Hi everyone,

I'm having an issue with my broker: they don't offer live charts for free, and I have to pay an exorbitant subscription fee (10 dollars per chart, seriously?). I want to monitor my stock watchlist with real-time charts without breaking the bank. I used to rely on Yahoo Finance, but the charts often don’t update automatically, and I have to refresh the page, which is annoying. I tried TradingView, but the free version limits the watchlist size, so it’s not ideal. Google Finance isn’t live, so that’s a no-go.

Does anyone know a good website or platform (free or low-cost) that provides reliable real-time charts and a customizable watchlist without too many restrictions? I’d love to have tools like technical indicators and a smooth, bug-free experience to analyze my stocks easily. If you have any recommendations, I’d really appreciate your suggestions! 

Thanks in advance!

1mghrvv,2025-08-03,"Week Recap: Weak job market, tariffs, and no rate cut. The S&P 500 closed lower 2.36%. It's biggest weekly drop since the week of May 18. July 28, 2025 – August 1, 2025
First of all, I don't want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it visualized via closing prices from July 25 to August 1.

I had 18-week streak in Week Recap, but I took a break the last 2-week. Now, it's time for a fresh start 😀

We know that August 1 is the tariff deadline, so we can wait to high volality. As expected, the stock market closed the week in negative. The S&P 500 made 4-day losing streak.

📊 Here are the S&P 500's week-by-week results for the last 4 week,

July 3 close at 6,279.35 - July 11 close at 6,259.75 🔴 (-0.31%)

July 11 close at 6,259.75 - July 18 close at 6,296.79 🟢 (0.59%)

July 18 close at 6,296.79 - July 25 close at 6,388.64 🟢 (1.46%)

July 25 close at 6,388.64 - August 1 close at 6,238.01 🔴 (-2.36%)

🔸 Monday: This week started with good news from EU that U.S. reached a trade deal. EU will purchase $750B worth of energy and invest $600B more than previously planned. The stock market opened mixed. The S&P 500 was lower, but Nasdaq was higher. During the session, Morgan Stanley's Wilson predicted 7,200 by Mid-2026. Also, Oppenheimer raised year end target to 7,100 from 5,950. The stock market closed slightly higher. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: The most important event was FOMC meeting in this week. Before the FOMC, the stock market opened flat. Job openings data released and fell by 275,000 to 7.437 million. Job market was weak in July. On the other hand, consumer confidence jumped 95.2 to 97.2 in July. It is still weak, but it is higher the lowest level in March. The U.S. and China have agreed to extend tariff truce, but it wasn't enough to lift. The stock market closed lower. 🔴

🔸 Wednesday: Before the session, Q2 GDP was released and came at 3.0%. Q1 was -0.5%. It's a positive sign and the stock market opened higher. During the session, FOMC meeting completed and interest rates unchanged as expected. Powell said we have made no decisions about September meeting. However, CME FedWatch tool is showing 80% possibility of 25 point rate cut in September. The stock market closed lower again. 🔴

🔸 Thursday: Before the session, Fed's favorite economic indicator that Core PCE inflation was released. Previous month data was revised to 2.8% year-over-year. July data is same as June and expectations. On the other hand, Microsoft and Meta released their earnings on Wednesday. The stocks smashed the expectations. The stock market opened higher. During the session, tariffs concerns dropped the indexes and the stock market closed lower. 🔴

🔸 Friday: And, August 1 arrived. The unemployment rate rose in July. The stock market opened lower. Tariffs on Canada were increased from 25% to 35%. Many countries were impacted this increments because they did not reach any agreement yet. Trump announced the new tariffs will start August 7. The stock market closed lower. Also, he fires head of labor statistics. The S&P 500 dropped 1.60% and it's highest single day drop since May 21. 🔴

We were in a good rally, but tariff concerns cut again. While a few countries have agreed, many are still in negotiations or something. Also, job market did not help to lift as Powell. I think, 6,400 might be highest level for a while. After the September, I'm still optimistic. 

What do you think? What do you think? How was your week?

❓ Note: Many people have asked where screenshots come from in my previous posts. I'm using Stock+ on iPhone and iPad. You can find it on the App Store. If you're using Android, I'm now sure if it's available, but you can try searching ""Stock Map"" or ""Heat Map"". 
but but but he’s a… businessman.. The rally was losing steam even before the job numbers fiasco. Probably even before the earnings season started, if we are to look at the earnings reactions. Pullback was coming nonetheless. It was inevitable. Stocks don’t always go up. Depends what inflation does. Weak job market means potential rate cut, and there’s plenty room for rate cut No.  The market participants have ignored the data for awhile.  This will go on until the wreckage of the economy is in their front yards trying to hammer down their doors. Why did Amazon fall so much harder than the rest? Market doesn’t seem rational at all anymore. Who knows. At least you don’t have to see and hear Kamala Harris laugh on interviews on TV, right? I agree with you. After the S&P 500 rebounded from 5k, we saw fastly recovering. Most of people have been talking about 6300-6400 bands. I think so, we will see a bit flat market until at least first rate cut in September (I hope). However, if U.S. reach an agreement with China, the situation could change.

It sure is healthy to have the fate of the entire market rest on one company How many Americans are buying index funds while not realizing ~40% of their investment is in 10 companies (highest ever) 7 companies actually. And they are all centered around & 100% banking on AI; with exception to amazon. That said, point still stands, absolutely baffling that the entire US economy rests on seven companies that are very likely heavily inflated in value. The performance of those 10 companies is the reason they’re buying Nasdaq 100 and S&P Growth Funds instead of target date funds. Saying no one uses Google is crazy. Google maps, google docs , google disk, gmail, Waymo, Gemini. Comparing Google to Kodak is beyond crazy bro.

1meigeq,2025-08-01,"The US stock market is undefeated against ex-US, the US dollar, and inflation
There's been a lot of talk about the US equities market being down in real terms as the dollar has been losing strength. That got me thinking - let's using TradingView to measure SPY (as a proxy for the overall market) against...

[SPY normalized for the US dollar](https://preview.redd.it/1tw67hf4yagf1.png?width=3019&format=png&auto=webp&s=991890ec18b7e815b19598be5dbcfb963eba588a)

I found it interesting that SPY took until 2014 to recover from the .com and 2008 crashes, however when normalizing for the US dollar, it actually fully recovered by 2011. Also, this shows how strong equities are to fight off inflation. If you have assets, inflation isn't gonna do anything to your net worth. If you don't, you're boned.

TL;DR - US equities go up and to the right, always, no matter what they're measured against.
The US has been an hegemonic power for almost a century, thats the only reason… times are changing tho The ex-US figure is the one that matters for the claim that you're making, and you can see right there on your graph that it's down since the beginning of 2025. That's what all the talk is about. It did. European Markets combined with the euro outperformed the SPX by like 10% ytd. [deleted] That assumes an independent fed and independent statistics bureau. The US is pushing closer and closer to a one party system - THEIRS. Also, the executive branch has been consolidating power and Congress has been giving away its power more and more. 

We are at a point where checks and balances are close to fully deteriorating. A president is now immune from all prosecution and can do whatever they want as long as the opposition does not hold both houses and a high majority in the senate.

If we turn to an el salvador, Turkey or Russia, US exceptionalism can end.  Do we become China where the president starts really meddling with companies?  

While it isnt the end, Americans are becoming more and more ok with a centralization of power where Congress isnt even needed Yes, that's what inflation is. China isn’t the richest nation. US still continues to hold that title.

PPP is irrelevant when comparing two countries output in global economy, GDP is better. PPP is better when looking at domestic metrics. 

Even by national wealth, US leads. You should read more about China. They are already the richest nation and largest trade partner of the world, but their technology and military is advancing fast too. I was talking YTD. Dax is up 17% ytd. Additionally the euro is up 11.4% ytd.


Comparatively the s&p 500 performed 24% worse ytd.


Edit: Even looking only at the performance since april 7th, the Dax + Euro outperformed the SPX by 2.1%.
In the end, I agree with your idea though, that you should probably not flee the US Market. It wasn't a good idea in april and it is not a good idea now. Considering the weak USD, it's even likely, that investing in the US as a foreign investor is a good idea atm.

So the US does need our metals. Who would’ve thunk. ""Willing to work""

More like America desperately needs them or else manufacturing there will be cost prohibitive. Carney is too smart to fall for Trump's bluffs. He has a PhD in economics. He was a VP at Goldman Sachs, and ran Bank of Canada and Bank of England. Only foreigner to ever run BoE. A few days ago, Aluminerie Alouette in Sept-Îles announced that it had shifted the majority of its aluminum exports from the U.S. to Europe. In January, only 4% of its output was shipped to Europe; by July, that figure had surged to 80%, according to the CEO.

Aluminerie Alouette is the largest aluminum smelter in both North and South America. Its annual production is nearly equivalent to the total yearly aluminum output of the United States.

Poly market are just regards like us betting. Honestly zero valuable indication of what will happen. They're just not sure how the economy will react to all these tariffs. If inflation starts increasing, even if unemployment increases as well, they'll have to keep or raise rates.

The fact that inflation is still higher than target, but rates are also high, shows that something isn't quite right Yes but at least they do it with some money and not just post a reddit comment >unemployment increases

Depends. A few places are expecting them to deal with the unemployment side of their dual mandate over inflation. Ik we've had some talks with a senior economist at our bank that it is more likely than not what will happen.

1mdfu4i,2025-07-30,"More Tariff News - 50% Tariff on Copper
President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/) on Wednesday signed on order imposing a universal 50% tariff on [copper](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/@HG.1/) imports, the latest metal he has targeted with a steep import tax.

U.S. copper prices plunged as much as 18% in after-hours trading as soon as the White House announced the new tariff rate. Copper miners [Freeport-McMoRan](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/FCX/) and [Southern Copper](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SCCO/) were down about 10% and more than 6%, respectively.

The sell-off, if it holds through Thursday’s trading session, will mark the metal’s largest single-day decline since 1989.

The new, higher copper tariffs go into effect Friday, according to a [fact sheet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/07/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-takes-action-to-address-the-threat-to-national-security-from-imports-of-copper/) released by the White House.
Why make anything in America if all your input costs will be 50% more? Can just make it in Japan or Europe. No higher costs to produce and ship to the world, Americans pay only 15% tariff tax to buy it.

>Note before the read: Not a professional or any predictor. Only personal perspective, please do your own research before doing any investing.   


📉 **Signal 1: Stocks vs. Bonds — Expected Returns Near Convergence**  
The first chart compares expected returns of the S&P 500 and 10-year U.S. Treasuries. The spread is now near zero—meaning equities and bonds are offering similar prospective returns. This often signals an overheated equity market and may trigger capital rotation back into bonds.

  
📊 **Signal 2: Overextended Breadth**  
The second chart shows the percentage of S&P 500 stocks trading above their 50-day moving average. Once again, it has surpassed the 75% threshold—levels that have marked local peaks at least twice in the past year.



**♦︎ About the Gold**

That golden dip in April might have been the year’s best. A deeper pullback could come later this year—and when it does, it might be the perfect time to pounce on **SQQQ**.

1m92iqp,2025-07-25,"I debunked the Golden Cross (20 years on S&P 500)
The media often talk about the Golden cross and Death cross.

I tested it on SPY over the last 20 years. **It's a very unreliable signal for long-term overperformance.**

The strategy rules were:

* Buy when there is a golden cross on the daily chart
* Sell when there is a death cross

If it underperformed big time on the SPY, which has been trending up very well over the last 2 decades, then I can't imagine how useless it would be on other assets that haven't trended as clearly as SPY.
Sounds to me like bs used to swing sentiment on the uninformed I think it would actually be more successful on other assets. 

SPY price is way more efficient than the average stock price, and the more efficient a market, the less likely you are to beat a buy/hold strategy. Exactly. Did you try the same backtest on an annual chart with daily bar lengths? I’m curious if those results would be better or worse. Its astrology. The results will be the same. Try UPRO with the same exact buy/sell dates as above. Which golden cross? 50 and 200 ma?

1m8f0mi,2025-07-24,"Tesla falls out of trillion-dollar club after ugly earnings
Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) stock came under pressure Thursday after it posted an earnings and revenue miss in the second quarter and CEO Elon Musk hinted at a ""few rough quarters"" amid mounting challenges for the automaker.

Tesla reported second quarter revenue of $22.50 billion vs. $22.64 billion expected (per Bloomberg consensus), a 12% drop compared with the $25.05 billion reported a year ago. Tesla posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.40 vs $0.42, with operating income coming in at $923 million vs. $1.23 billion expected.

Tesla's revenue from the sale of regulatory credits fell to $439 million from $890 million a year earlier, and will continue to drop following passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), the company said. Musk spent months blasting the bill, but Trump signed it into law earlier this month.

Tesla stock closed [down 8.2% on Thursday](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-slides-after-earnings-miss-musk-warns-of-few-rough-quarters-221407333.html).
Should be worth at least 90% less Elmo made his bed, now he has to lie in it. It's still way overpriced. Now with government subsidies drying up, the company is going to have some hard times ahead. The ironic thing is that Elon was actively funding Trump's campaign, so he is the indirect cause of the loss of income from government subsidies. He is arguably the DIRECT cause of ALL of his losses at this point Good, fuck Elon Musk Don't worry, they'll be back soon enough. Tesla is always bouncing in and out of the trillion dollar club tbh. 

No I don't agree with the valuation but they've been bouncing in and out pretty constantly lol. Exactly my valuation - but that was based on Q4/24 numbers Waymo, Uber, traditional automakers, China...

I would very much like some solid advice here. I'm new to the market in this capacity sans having a few IRA's etc and the typical 401k.

“I have no real knowledge of which is a good or bad stock.” Sounds like you shouldn’t be buying individual stock. Buy the S&P 500 or S&P 500 growth (SPYG) and don’t touch it. VTI.

We spend more than what i was advising on a couple drunken weekends...People telling people they give terrible advice on a stock thats turned $3K into $50K probably should stfu. I can tell you an individual stock thay has great potential. But first, how much of the $10,000 are you willing to lose? Don’t buy stocks, buy ETF’s.  I’m a big fan of JEPQ and SCHD.  ETF’s are like buying a small basket of different stocks that experts put together for a particular goal.  It will be lower risk than individual stocks but also likely not as high of a reward depending on the ETF performance. I’m no pro so grain of salt and all but that’s how I think about it. People here are going to tell you to be average and buy something like a etf that will take you 40 years to retire. My advice is do deep research and look for next megatrends (sectors like space, ai, medicine, energy)…And choose the likely winners in those sectors, i did it an i massively outperformed the market How old are you? Do you have time to watch things closely? What are your expectations?. If you have time to watch and that money can be lost and not break you, then you can play some stocks. If you cant stand to lose it tomorrow/next month/next year..buy mutual funds or etf's. Stocks are a gamble for the most part. I only have 10% of my portfolio in actual stocks.

1m7lp78,2025-07-23,"Google Crushes Earnings… and the Stock Drops? Classic Market Nonsense.
Google just reported and they crushed everything. Top line beat. Bottom line beat. Revenue beat. Profit beat. They beat by a lot. And at one point after hours, the stock was down 3 percent. That doesn’t make sense.

This is the kind of stuff that drives me nuts. It’s proof that in the short run, stocks are a voting machine. In the long run, they’re a weighing machine. Google is one of the best businesses out there. They own the number one and number two search engines in the world, Google and YouTube. That’s insane. It’s an incredible business.

I still think Google is one of the most reasonably priced of the Magnificent 7 stocks. Of course, people are worried about AI. Everyone thinks AI is going to completely change search. That might be true, or it might be overblown. We really don’t know yet. But the fear is there.

Still, the fundamentals are strong. This company is executing. They’re growing. They’re profitable. And yet they get punished after reporting great numbers. That’s the market for you. It’s short-term noise.

They’ll have their conference call and we’ll see what comes out of that. But the reality is, Google is an incredible business. If you want to know what I think it’s worth, go to our YouTube channel or our 24/7 platform. I break it all down there.

This is why discipline matters. This is why you focus on fundamentals. Ignore the short-term moves. Stay focused on value.

1m68tfb,2025-07-22,"The U.S. stock market’s rebound that started in May looks like it’s nearing its end.
After accurately predicting the sharp market crash in March earlier this year, I now believe we’re once again on the brink of a major downturn.

Having watched the markets for years, one thing I’ve learned for sure: about 80% of the dry financial theories I studied in business school are useless when it comes to actual trading—unless you’re a researcher or academic.

Let’s hope this call is on point too. We’ll see by year-end.



Yet, I'm still giving it a try on some stocks that might look pretty much potential:

IBM, NVDA, TSMC, BGM and CSCO
Retail have been taking out record leverage. You just know what’s next 😅 Can you elaborate on why it will drop? 

Yes its at an all time high 

But what factors based on the graph makes you say it will crash? 

Genuinely curious A few red flags on the technical side: 1) Divergence between price and momentum (RSI), 2) Parabolic moves historically correct hard, 3) Retail participation at extremes. Fundamentally, earnings revisions are slowing while rates stay high, and credit stress is bubbling under the surface (watch commercial real estate). That said, timing is always the tricky part—this could drag on for months before breaking. Here are three undeniable facts:

\- At some point, the market WILL crash. If you aren't leveraged up to your eyeballs, you will survive that crash.

\- At some point after the crash, the market will reach a new ATH, UNLESS the USA/capitalism dies.

\- If capitalism dies, none of these charts mean shit anyway. If you account for the dying dollar the markets are technically down year to date. That and an economy that is clearly slowing. Consumer spending has slowed, although it has remained healthy so far for now. Wage growth is slowing. Inflation is ticking back up and remains sticky above 2%. While layoffs haven’t fully accelerated yet, job growth is slowing. Do up mean people have been doing insane option trading?

1m3gzs3,2025-07-18,"UNH to bounce back?
Does the theory of institutions suppressing UNH stock prices to accumulate stocks through the dark pool make sense? 

UNH showed high dark pool volume every single day, avg 50% of total trading. Today, dark pool trades spiked to 7.5M shares, nearly double the usual volume.

The price stabilized into the close instead of breaking down further. I dk if that’s unusual behavior but it feels like it should have spiralled more.

With earnings on July 29, this could be classic stealth accumulation right?
wear down weak hands, load in silence, then allow the move to unfold.

Or maybe im the idiot left holding the bag.
Institutions own \~90% of the stock's shares, the weird conspiracies do not explain the price movement. It's much simpler. ELV, a similar healthcare company, reported earnings on Thursday and their stock is now down almost 20%, mostly due to poor guidance. A lot of people look at that and think UNH's earnings will present a similar outcome. Healthcare in general is down a lot this week. Movement to tech and growth stocks. It's that simple. Molina and cnc earnings next week. Then unh. A lot of catalysts for volatility. [removed] I think most of the downside from ELV’s weak guidance is already priced into UNH. There was a sharp dip when ELV reported. I’d normally be a buyer here given the valuation and long-term strength of the sector. But the ongoing DOJ investigation makes me cautious in the short term.

That said, insider buying at these levels is encouraging, and the fact that healthcare insurers are among the most powerful lobbying forces in Washington suggests there’s still a strong chance of favorable policy or sentiment shifts. If DOJ noise fades or Q2 earnings surprise, this sector could bounce back fast. Ran the theory by chatgpt, checked the sources cited afterwards. Data is good. You can google or check it at chartexchange or whalestream yourself to be sure. I suppose in the very near term it benefits institutions if they are buying more here, but institutions as a whole would likely prefer the stock was back trading at $600 than less than half that. Some larger institutions are even suing the company for not denying enough claims (and thus higher costs and thinner margins). Same thing happened 2 weeks ago at around 302 then it spiked to 325 and shot back down I expect to see it somewhere under 280 depending how the rest of healthcare earnings go. ELV definitely didn’t give them momentum w the earnings but I think unh is gonna crush these estimates. My plan is to go with some nice August 8th calls about 310/315 if we get a Green Day on Monday. It’s obvious the news outlets are trying to crush this stock with anything they can to shake people out and buy lower. The rich get richer 🤷🏼‍♂️ Im not familiar with structured notes at all. But if the win condition is for UNH to not fall below 40%, then this just seems like free money at this point Just did a quick google on structured notes.
You're risking 40% of your investment for a potential what? 10% return? Idk but it sounds terrifying unless im understanding it wrongly.

1m2gpgc,2025-07-17,"What strategies do you guys use to exit/take profit on an all time high stock?
Im trying to figure out some strategies to exit a position/take profit on all time high stocks without selling and then stock keep running constantly (for example recently on MSFT and NVDA and how they just go up and right permanently at ATH lately)

Its obviously much easier to see support and resistance when stocks arent at all time high and can see trends and patterns in the stock price, but when its at all time high what strategies do you use to know when the trend is reversing or it may be time to sell and take all those juicy profits?

This is mainly directed to people who swing trade for profit and not investors who just buy and never sell. I'm looking for strategies on when you feel confident a stock has reached its top and a pretty significant down trend is starting.
Msft has been hitting aths consistently for years with like 2 misses since dot com bubble. If you are worried about aths on mega corps I don’t know what to tell you. It’s a long term hold not a day trader position. I think whether a stock is at an all time high is completely irrelevant in deciding when to sell. The only thing you should ask is what your time horizon is for withdraw and whether you think, given the stock and market conditions, you will receive adequate returns by the time you need to withdraw. 

Ideally, your time horizon should be very far out in the future and you should DCA your investments. It’s the best long term strategy and is entirely independent of whether you’re at an all time high now Why doesn’t everyone just sell high and buy lower, are they all stupid? Sell ITM or NTM call options and exit with the premium and the capital gains. A good no Brainerd strategy is if you hit 100% return, sell half. I like to look for 2 ""tops"" in a downsloped ""M"" formation, that is to say a runup then a bounce off, say $400, pushes back down and runs back up but fails to attain higher than previous, like $397.

I have trade logs going back about 9 years, this strategy is solid for a swing trading mindset. Have something you want to do with the profits or at least buy money market and shoot for the next dip, but be prepared that it may not come for a while if we keep pushing up.

If you are a long term investor then don't even bother selling! Just add :) Yes Ehhh - look at this from a different perspective. . . I’m a “buy and hold” guy and I own lots of MSFT.  I’ll probably sell a little tomorrow to take some profits and I park that in a HYSA for dry powder later or to start a position in a new company.  

Opportunities will always present themselves, but I never sell MSFT to hope it goes lower and then buy it back.  I am simply taking some money off the table.

I bought a bunch of stock in April and it was the “dry powder” that paid for the buys. Personally I don’t believe timing is a reliable or safe thing to do.  However…. You might consider trading options as a way to earn money without selling.  Since you own the stock already it’s less risky than other options strategies. I stay in.

This move could challenge Google's dominance in the browser market and impact its advertising revenue model. We saw GOOG move on the announcement of Perplexity's development of a web browser, so today will likely see GOOG moving down as well depending on how well the presentation goes. If the presentation doesn't have any revolutionary features, I'm more interested in looking at a GOOG long.

This spiked massively premarket but I want to continue watching this- the black box warning is actually a positive sign because it means that it'll be allowed to stay on market despite causing patient deaths. Future risks are potential for further adverse events related to ELEVIDYS, regulatory scrutiny, typical risks when dealing with biotech.

1m1qulj,2025-07-16,"My portfolio : yes, i'm losing money severly ...
Hi everyone,

  
This is my ""extra EU portfolio"". Yes that oculd be ""strange"" how i said it but in France, we've got a specific tax advantaged EU portofolio, (we can buy only european stock for 150 000€ max and we have to keep this amount in the portfolio during 5 years to get timeless tax advantage ...

  
So you will find only US/UK/Aus stock on this portfolio. Sorry it's in french but you will understand easily. I hide some information about how much i put on these stocks.

  
So what do you think ?

my dream : sell everything and keep only 4 stocks with the best entry possible. Because i was f...ed by Euro/Dollars change (more than 14% of loss in addition)

My biggest mistake is to try to use my brain and try to fit my stock with the economic trend. Finally, i should have only followed the trend of reddit : Rocket lab, ast space, one quantum stock, circle and robinhood, and i would be richer than today ...

Some explanation of my portfolio :

\- AI stock : so i took Arista as leader of networking for AI data center, Marvell for custom chipset and their strong position in this sector (google, amazon and some other big cap company). And Vertiv for the part of cooling data center. I got Nvidia and Amazon but i sold before 2 april and during deepseek. I got Coreweave, TSS inc and Nebius, both make me money, i just follow reddit trend, and that works sometime

\- Energy : Trump wanted to open the market of LNG for the world and this energy is used for data center. So i took cheniere and kinder morgan, that doesn't move, it's blocked. I take ITM power for Green Hydrogen, but the stock is dropping hard since i bough it (-20% in one week)

\-Gold : i take Genesis minerals, the stock is dropping too while gold begin its rally. Why ? i don't know...

  
I got Arista, Cheniere, Kinder Morgan, and Marvell since the early year.


You got NVIDIA and sold during deepseek... Yeah I can see the problem there I am astonished by the amount of people who don't actually read yearly company reports or properly research a company's management and then act surprised at their poor investment results. 

Neither Grok, nor some macroeconomic gambling will make you rich. Unless you are one of the few geniuses who can consistently predict the economy or write SOTA ML models which can do it for you, stick to actually doing in-depth company research and picking a handful of good businesses you deeply understand in industries that you have experience in.

And let's be real, the fact that you are posting here instead of working for RenTech should be enough evidence for you to know that you are not one of those geniuses. > Gold : i take Genesis minerals, the stock is dropping too while gold begin its rally. Why ? i don't know...

Well you picked a stock in a company which operates exclusively in one region, and its performance is going to depend on the output of a limited number of assets in this one specific place. 

You invested in a company. If you actually want to invest in gold then you go with something like IAUM. You’re not good at this. Buy an etf and stop playing around. i got only etf sp500 and Nasdaq. 90 of my portfolios are on ETF (SP500 and Nasdaq) and you can see on the pannel, the mention of ETP lol

Second, i know i can lose money, it's not the question. The question is why i lost money with good company and good sector ?

Why Rocketlab take 100% in one month with nothing, while Arista Network can't come back to ATH like other AI stock while it's the leader and really good earning ?

That is the question ...

Most professionals beat the market. If you can make an effort of translation, you should listen to William Higgons, he is a fund manager, he beats the market every years with only european smallcap (and few big cap ...). He explains why he beats the market every years and why other funds don't. It's not a matter of skills ... The advice would probably be to not invest in gold mining companies if you want to invest in gold and expect the same results ANET is a great company, I am long and wish I bought more under 100. The fear is that Nvidia is trying to cut into their networking business. 

Rocket lab is all hype. Basically a meme stock at this point with some small government contracts and decent growth. It got a huge boost after Elon’s fight with Trump. I’ve talked to several people who know nothing about investing who have purchased rocket lab in the last year. 

Momentum chasing is how you lose in the long run. It’s really only a short term trading strategy. Just gotta be patient and let those outlandish valuations go. Eventually they crash and burn, or will be dead money for a decade. Slow and steady wins the race

Imo Tesla is m company that will be dead money for 10 years, even with all the exciting developments that could happen. All because the price you pay today is for profits they might produce 10 years from now. Grok is the worst AI, it checks for elons opinions before giving info. HOW!!@!@????

1m16ldf,2025-07-16,"Do stocks in targeted 401k index funds have an unfair advantage?
Since these stocks are purchased automatically by millions of employees every paycheck won't their stock prices almost always go up regardless of any short-term issues? 

* For example, if a company like AAPL, which is frequently in targeted index funds, came out with a bad product, lots of people would sell their individual shares.  However, since it is part of most targeted index funds lots of people will still actually be buying it with their paychecks regardless of their latest bad announcement.


It seems competitively unfair that a majority of peoples 401ks go to a select few mega companies that will continue to grow indefinitely in a self fulfilling cycle.  

* People are buying AAPL because it is a top holding in most 401ks, which means its valuation will continue to grow, which means people will continue buying it, which means it will remain a top holding forever.
I see your point, but you could also argue that we always have people retiring and using the same funds every single day And yet, these stocks experience the same dips at the same time during global events as all others (Covid-dip March 2020, start of Ukraine war 2022, last August, this „Liberation Day“…. Yes, a stock in a popular index or a target of popular funds will trade at a premium.  But it should be noted most funds are market cap weighted.  So if Apple falls at say 3X vs the rest of the pack, it will be purchased a third as much.

This is an argument for buying small-caps...many are not on big name indexes so do not get that passive fund fire hose of buys .  But...many small-caps are garbage companies or struggle with financing for growth. I don’t know if they have an unfair advantage but they definitely have an advantage. Index funds tend to invest in the S&P 500 which are better capitalized than smaller stocks in the Russell 2000. The bottom 50% of earners only own 9% of the stock market, which are probably US numbers vs. .non-US numbers even lower. 

In contrast the top 10% of wealthy people in the U.S. own .. 93% of stocks.  Not to mention most have 2x more in bonds over stocks (except for “founders” like Gates, Ellison, etc.. with Buffett being the odd investor out). The vast majority aren’t going to own much mutual funds/ETFs either.  Probably the same globally as the wealthy can have multiple worldwide residences (immigration controls are for the “poors”).  Watched Bloomberg last night where a blurb mentioned a family who made their money in Scandinavia .. then decamped to Singapore and now are buying lots of US/Euro stocks (I then switched to something a little more relevant.. the late Andrew Bourdain’s show on how to make my campesino diet [rice and beans w/an egg] more flavorful, .. but I digress). 

So there’s a bunch of active money still moving the stock market. What you're describing is known as an index bubble.

It's the same reason why stocks see sudden rises or dips when they get listed or delisted from a large index fund. Being listed on a large index fund ensures passive capital flows through 401k contributions. Yes, but it is diluted in what is now a massive market overall.

You're on the right track, in general the killing of pension programs and getting people to use 401ks to invest has been very lucrative for Wall St, remember you didn't used to have to do that.

Now, companies weild our combined retirement assets as a source of power for their own means. Fidelity Investments, for example, definitely uses the Trillions under their control for their benefit, and this is something that should be examined. You’re hitting on the passive flow paradox big index names like AAPL get auto bought no matter the news. Feels like momentum fueled by structure, not fundamentals. It’s not like a stock being included in big funds is hidden from investors. The Trade Desk (TTD) was added to the S&P500 yesterday and saw a huge jump for this exact reason. 

Pension funds are inherently risk-averse. They don’t want to pay massive fees to have tons of active management of their assets, and they don’t want to hold tons of speculative stocks that might go to 0. Large, stable companies get rewarded by being added to indexes like the S&P500 or Nasdaq100. Also if a fund manager removes Apple from their portfolio it will cause the market cap to drop due to large selling volume, market cap drops then every index fund has to reduce its weighting cause a tonne more selling.

1lz83ul,2025-07-14,"Prime Day 2025 U.S. retailers drove $24.1 billion in online spend, up 30.3% from 2024, according to new data from Adobe
July 12 (Reuters) - Online spending soared $24.1 billion across U.S. retailers during the stretch from July 8 to 11 – dubbed ""Black Friday in Summer"", outpacing Adobe Analytics' prior forecast, as eager shoppers rushed to snap up deep discounts on back-to-school essentials.Retailers recorded online sales growth of 30.3% during events that included Amazon Prime Day, Adobe said on Saturday, compared with [its projections of ](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-prime-day-set-lift-us-online-sales-238-billion-adobe-estimates-2025-07-07/)28.4%.

Online retail sales in the U.S. rose 11% to [$14.2 billion a year ago](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-prime-day-boosts-us-online-sales-142-bln-adobe-says-2024-07-18/).The Prime Day event has also been cemented as a ""back-to-school"" shopping moment, as consumers jumped on early deals to stock up on essentials and get ahead of the back-to-school rush, Adobe said. 

Several major retailers including e-commerce giant [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) [(AMZN.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/AMZN.O), Walmart [(WMT.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/WMT.N), Target [(TGT.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/TGT.N) as well as Best Buy [(BBY.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/BBY.N) have been launching deal events with strong discounts, encouraging shoppers to trade up on expensive items they might normally pass [on.Amazon.com](http://on.Amazon.com) extended its sales window to 96 hours, up from the typical 48, featuring aggressive promotions on categories ranging from apparel to electronics.

A wave of enticing deals comes at a time when heightened trade tensions amid the Trump administration's volatile tariff policies have rattled consumers and businesses, and as the new August 1 deadline for countries to renegotiate trade agreements with the United States looms.

According to the report, shopping on mobile was the dominant transaction channel during the Prime Day event, driving 53.2% of online sales, above Adobe's forecast of 52.5%.

According to Adobe, overall discounts across U.S. retailers were between 11% and 24%, compared with the prior forecast range of 10% to 24%.Apparel had the biggest deals at 24%, compared with 20% last year, while electronics were at 23%, similar to last year.

Didnt I just read an article that it was down 41% in first day sales? That's one way to fudge the numbers. Prime day last year was only 2 days. This year they made it 4 days The lack of interest is probably why it was 4 days instead of 2 to begin with But the deals were barely any good. Plus more opportunity to make sure all the media and affiliate ads reach everyone. But rather unfortunate timing right after Bezoz and Lizard Woman had that big ostentatious LOOK HOW FUCKING RICH WE ARE wedding in Venice. The first Item I wanted was 120 before prime, $118 during due to a ""24%"" sale after jacking up the price. 
The second item ""16%"" off was actually higher then before prime 
What a joke So they DOUBLED the number of days that make up ""Prime Day"" and grew the Prime event by only 11%? It was 2 days last year, so opening it up to 4 days with only an 11% spike shows that this Prime event was a disaster.

1mn4xdd,2025-08-11,"$PSTV Just Set Their 1 for 25 Reverse Split Date for August 15th!
Another major update, Another major post... 
PSTV just announced their 1 for 25 reverse split is set for August 15th! Perfectly timed during the SNO/ASCO CNS Metastases Conference (August 14–16), where they’ll be presenting multiple major catalysts in front of the world . This same conference has sent other biotechs Flying...This timing could make August one of the most exciting months in PSTV’s history.

In my opinion this is Huge for us..

Higher Share Price Attracts Bigger Investors...
The reverse split will push the stock price from what it is now, to around $20, removing the penny stock stigma and making it attractive to institutions and funds that can’t touch low priced shares.
And. Before I see 100 comments about it... YES.. stocks normally do drop after a reverse split UNLESS they are immediately followed by a major catalyst. Which is why the timing of this split is absolutely PERFECT..

There are SEVERAL major Catalysts Lined Up at the Conference... 

PSTV will present final clinical trial results for REYOBIQ targeting leptomeningeal metastases... a critical, underserved brain cancer area. They’ll also update on their CNSide diagnostic launch and educational symposium, all of which could be massive value drivers.

Compressed Float Means Bigger Moves,
Fewer shares post split means any surge in buying around these catalysts could cause sharper, faster price spikes..  great for all of you momentum traders.

Recently received $3 Million Department of Defense grant, FDA IND clearance for trials, and $1.6 Million CPRIT funding show credible backing and reduce financial risks.

I know I'm going to get A LOT of push back for this post so I'll post the math here and make it simple... 

Let’s say you put $10,000 into PSTV at 80 cents a share BEFORE the reverse split... That means you owned 12,500 shares....

When the 1 for 25 reverse split happens on August 15th, your shares get combined into just 500 shares, but the price jumps by 25 times... (From 80 cents to about $20). Your total investment still adds up to about $10,000 right after the split.

Now, here’s where it gets VERY interesting... Using our pre split price, let's see how much you could really make with a $10k investment at .80 cents....

If the stock moves up to $1.20, your investment jumps to $15,000.. that’s a 50% gain.

If it climbs to $2.00, you’re sitting on $25,000...a 150% gain.

And if things really take off, hitting $4.00, your $10,000 grows to $50,000!! that’s 5x your money. When we think this thing holds sentiment to make a run towards $10!! 

This isnt all unicorns and rainbows though... There is some serious red flags still and this is STILL a volatile stock..PSTV has done several reverse splits in recent years. This can be a red flag for serious investors... indicating ongoing struggles to keep the stock price up and maintain listing compliance. It might shake confidence that the company can sustain long term growth...The company’s near term value HEAVILY depends on successful presentations and data at the conference this week.... If results are underwhelming or delayed, the stock could suffer significant declines. That creates a “binary” risk where the outcome drastically affects your investment.

August 15 represents a pivotal moment for PSTV, as the reverse stock split streamlines the share structure coinciding with the release of crucial clinical data and corporate updates. If these factors align favorably, the stock could experience MASIVE upward momentum. However, it is important to acknowledge that this remains a high risk investment characterized by considerable volatility, so risk management and position sizing are essential.

Im honestly interested in knowing what's going through everyone's head...Are you gearing up to hold through the split or playing it safe? What’s your take on PSTV's position? 
Right, you haven’t specifically told anyone to buy it, but you are actively selling the stock.  That what your posts are.  You telling us all the reasons why we should buy this stock.  Yah, I didn’t reread your whole posts, just went back to see if I misread 1:2 split the first time.  I saw you you stated the edit.  Just wondering why if a 1:2 split signaled confidence and was good that it was so low, why isn’t the 1:25 split bad? Didn’t I just read you saying that it was going to be a 1:2 split and how that was so great because it was such a small split.  And now a 1:25 split is announced and that changes absolutely nothing from the 1:2.  Please correct me if I’m wrong. *This is huge for us* Same. Doesn't a company have to file a SEC filing first? Although if it is true, it's dumping time. Because a reverse split that big is NOT what the board was authorized to do. It was authorized to do a 2:1 split at their discretion. So, it's scammy as all hell IF it is true. Oh, so I guess that's where that ratio 1:25 came from.

the no other news is why I haven't dumped yet. Something is fishy here. Because I know that nasdaq requires companies to send them at minimum a 10 day notification before the effective date of the reverse split. If there really was going to be a reverse split on august 15, that means PVTS had to have sent nasdaq a notification on august 5 at the latest. And I can't find anything that suggests that. 

But the moment it comes out that this news is true, it really is dumping time. Its not worth the risk. If the news is false, well, I'm gonna hold. What's the source, I dont see a SEC filing? The patented platform for diagnostics is a solid play besides from their medicine. I am thinking of holding long term. I think their average 9$ price target on Zacks is justifiable. Not sure if they will reverse split but I don't think they even need to. I hope it gets to a price point it deserves either way. He is lying all the time, first no rs then 1/2 (COMPANY SHOWS CONFIDENCE) now 1/25 and ""It's PERFECT TIMING"" :D I can see couple accounts on similar subreddits that write like him with double dots "".."". Too suspicious, time to sell or trim at least. The board has authorisation for the reverse split, but there is not SEC filing yet. There is also no news from the company, just rumours. Im not saying it won't happen, but it's a bit odd that the rumours started on a Sunday.

1mmwfvg,2025-08-10,"$WFLD / $LTV: A Geopolitical Catalyst: Why Trump's Tariffs on Swiss Gold Could Be a Game-Changer for Tradewind Markets
Dear investors,

A seismic shift is underway in the global precious metals industry, and it's happening faster than most realize. The recent chaos surrounding potential US tariffs on Swiss gold isn't just another headline; it's a fundamental disruption of a decades-old supply chain. This turmoil exposes the deep-seated vulnerabilities of the traditional gold market and, in doing so, creates what I believe is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for a North American alternative.

Tradewind Markets, through its upcoming RTO, is uniquely positioned to capture the fallout from this disruption. Let's break down why this geopolitical event is such a powerful catalyst.

# 1. The Disruption: Switzerland's Gold Dominance Becomes a Critical Vulnerability

For decades, the world has relied on Switzerland as its primary gold refiner, handling an estimated 34% of the world's total production. This concentration has now become a systemic risk. The threat of a 39% US tariff has sent shockwaves through the market, revealing just how fragile this dependency is.

The panic is justified: Swiss gold exports to the US exploded to **39.2 billion Swiss francs** in the first half of 2025 alone. A tariff of this magnitude would make these trade flows economically unviable, creating a massive supply vacuum and forcing market participants to urgently seek reliable, tariff-free alternatives.

# 2. The Unfair Advantage: The Royal Canadian Mint as a North American Safe Haven

This is where Tradewind's strategic positioning becomes a game-changer. Its exclusive partner and custodian is the **Royal Canadian Mint (RCM)**, and this is not just any partnership. The RCM offers three key advantages that private Swiss refineries cannot match in this environment:

* **Sovereign Backing:** The RCM is a Crown corporation of the Canadian government. In a world of trade wars and uncertainty, this offers an unparalleled level of security and political stability.
* **Geographic Immunity:** All gold custodied at the RCM is located in North America. It is completely insulated from the trade disputes between the US and Switzerland/EU.
* **Supply Chain Integrity:** The RCM refines and custodies the gold itself. This vertical integration eliminates the cross-border risks and transparency issues (such as questionable sourcing) that have begun to plague the Swiss system.

# 3. The Technological Edge: Why Blockchain is the Superior Model

In a crisis, efficiency and transparency are paramount. Tradewind's VaultChain platform, built on blockchain technology, is not a gimmick; it's a superior operating model for this new era.

It directly addresses the market's biggest pain points:

* **Provenance & Transparency:** The platform's ""Tradewind Origins"" feature allows for the tracking of gold from the mine to the vault, providing a direct answer to the growing ethical and sourcing concerns surrounding traditional supply chains.
* **Scalability & Agility:** While building new physical refineries takes years and billions of dollars, Tradewind's digital platform can scale to handle massive increases in trading volume almost instantly. It is built to absorb the redirected trade flows from Switzerland.

# 4. The Strategic Timing: The RTO as a Fully-Funded Launchpad

A crisis is only an opportunity if you have the resources to act. The timing of the RTO is perfect. **It transforms Tradewind into a public company—a strategic move to mobilize capital and seize this unique market opportunity.**

The secured financing of at least **$4 million CAD** is structured intelligently:

* **$2 million is allocated to purchase physical gold**, which serves as collateral for the debentures. This builds a hard asset base and secures trust.
* **$2 million is available for business operations and expansion.** This is the growth capital needed to scale marketing and operations to capture market share from disrupted competitors.

This structure provides both stability and firepower, right when the starting gun has fired.

# 5. The Scale of the Opportunity: A Multi-Billion Dollar Shift

To be clear, this is not a niche opportunity. We are talking about the potential redirection of enormous capital flows. With **39.2 billion Swiss francs** in gold flowing from Switzerland to the US in just six months, even capturing a tiny fraction of this market would be transformative for Tradewind.

The global gold market is valued at approximately **$13 trillion**. The digital gold market is still in its infancy. This tariff disruption is the exact kind of catalyst needed to accelerate the migration from the old, inefficient system to a new, digital, and North American-based standard.

# Summary:

The investment case for the Tradewind RTO has just been fundamentally strengthened by external, geopolitical forces. We are witnessing a perfect storm: a crisis in the traditional supply chain, a superior North American solution with sovereign backing (RCM), a technologically advanced platform ready to scale, and a well-structured RTO providing the necessary capital.

This is no longer just a story about technology; it's a story about becoming a critical piece of North America's precious metals infrastructure at the precise moment it is most needed.

Best regards,

TradeToday

**PS:** The market is often slow to connect the dots between geopolitical events and the valuation of a micro-cap stock. This disconnect between the magnitude of this opportunity and the current share price is where the potential lies for informed and patient investors. This is a fundamental catalyst, not speculation.

*I've spent the last few days deep-diving into the implications of these potential tariffs, and the more I analyze the situation, the clearer the opportunity becomes. It feels like watching a strategic chess game where a single move suddenly changes the entire board in Tradewind's favor.*

>*""The Chinese use two brush strokes to write the word 'crisis.' One brush stroke stands for danger; the other for opportunity.""* \-- *John F. Kennedy*

Quick note to the community:

I’d really appreciate some feedback on my recent posts about Wellfield Technologies and Tradewind. Based on the current up- or downvotes, it’s hard to tell whether it makes sense to keep sharing my insights here, or if I should just stick to posting them in my two Reddit forums. Those are currently set up as pure information hubs, since I don’t have the time to actively moderate them - my work and all the other exciting companies and hobbies I’m involved with keep me pretty busy.

If you have thoughts, feel free to send me a PM instead of voting. I’d genuinely appreciate hearing from you directly.

# $WFLD / $LTV: Ein geopolitischer Katalysator: Warum Trumps Zölle auf Schweizer Gold ein Game-Changer für Tradewind Markets sein könnten

Liebe Investoren,

in der globalen Edelmetallbranche vollzieht sich ein seismischer Wandel, und er geschieht schneller, als die meisten realisieren. Das jüngste Chaos um mögliche US-Zölle auf Schweizer Gold ist nicht nur eine weitere Schlagzeile; es ist eine fundamentale Erschütterung einer jahrzehntealten Lieferkette. Diese Turbulenzen legen die tiefgreifenden Schwachstellen des traditionellen Goldmarktes offen und schaffen dadurch, so meine Überzeugung, eine einmalige Chance für eine nordamerikanische Alternative.

Tradewind Markets ist durch den bevorstehenden RTO einzigartig positioniert, um die Folgen dieser Disruption aufzufangen. Lasst uns analysieren, warum dieses geopolitische Ereignis ein so starker Katalysator ist.

# 1. Die Disruption: Die Gold-Dominanz der Schweiz wird zur kritischen Schwachstelle

Jahrzehntelang hat sich die Welt auf die Schweiz als Haupt-Goldraffinerie verlassen, die schätzungsweise 34 % der weltweiten Gesamtproduktion verarbeitet. Diese Konzentration ist nun zu einem systemischen Risiko geworden. Die Androhung eines US-Zolls von 39 % hat Schockwellen durch den Markt gesendet und offenbart, wie fragil diese Abhängigkeit ist.

Die Panik ist gerechtfertigt: Die Schweizer Goldexporte in die USA explodierten allein im ersten Halbjahr 2025 auf **39,2 Milliarden Schweizer Franken**. Ein Zoll dieser Höhe würde diese Handelsströme wirtschaftlich unrentabel machen, ein massives Angebotsvakuum schaffen und die Marktteilnehmer zwingen, dringend nach zuverlässigen, zollfreien Alternativen zu suchen.

# 2. Der unfaire Vorteil: Die Royal Canadian Mint als nordamerikanischer sicherer Hafen

Hier wird die strategische Positionierung von Tradewind zum Game-Changer. Sein exklusiver Partner und Verwahrer ist die **Royal Canadian Mint (RCM)**, und dies ist nicht nur irgendeine Partnerschaft. Die RCM bietet drei entscheidende Vorteile, die private Schweizer Raffinerien in diesem Umfeld nicht bieten können:

* **Staatliche Rückendeckung:** Die RCM ist ein staatliches Unternehmen (Crown Corporation) der kanadischen Regierung. In einer Welt von Handelskriegen und Unsicherheit bietet dies ein unübertroffenes Maß an Sicherheit und politischer Stabilität.
* **Geografische Immunität:** Alles bei der RCM verwahrte Gold befindet sich in Nordamerika. Es ist vollständig von den Handelsstreitigkeiten zwischen den USA und der Schweiz/EU isoliert.
* **Integrität der Lieferkette:** Die RCM raffiniert und verwahrt das Gold selbst. Diese vertikale Integration eliminiert die grenzüberschreitenden Risiken und Transparenzprobleme (wie fragwürdige Herkunft), die das Schweizer System zunehmend belasten.

# 3. Der technologische Vorsprung: Warum Blockchain das überlegene Modell ist

In einer Krise sind Effizienz und Transparenz von größter Bedeutung. Die VaultChain-Plattform von Tradewind, die auf Blockchain-Technologie basiert, ist keine Spielerei; sie ist ein überlegenes Betriebsmodell für diese neue Ära.

Sie adressiert direkt die größten Schmerzpunkte des Marktes:

* **Herkunft & Transparenz:** Die ""Tradewind Origins""-Funktion der Plattform ermöglicht die Nachverfolgung des Goldes von der Mine bis zum Tresor und liefert eine direkte Antwort auf die wachsenden ethischen Bedenken und Herkunftsfragen im Zusammenhang mit traditionellen Lieferketten.
* **Skalierbarkeit & Agilität:** Während der Bau neuer physischer Raffinerien Jahre und Milliarden von Dollar kostet, kann die digitale Plattform von Tradewind fast augenblicklich skalieren, um massive Zunahmen des Handelsvolumens zu bewältigen. Sie ist darauf ausgelegt, die umgeleiteten Handelsströme aus der Schweiz aufzunehmen.

# 4. Das strategische Timing: Der RTO als voll finanzierte Startrampe

Eine Krise ist nur dann eine Chance, wenn man die Mittel hat, zu handeln. Das Timing des RTO ist perfekt. **Er verwandelt Tradewind in ein börsennotiertes Unternehmen – ein strategischer Schritt, um Kapital zu mobilisieren und die einmalige Marktchance zu nutzen.**

Die gesicherte Finanzierung von mindestens **4 Millionen CAD** ist intelligent strukturiert:

* **2 Millionen CAD sind für den Kauf von physischem Gold vorgesehen**, das als Sicherheit für die Wandelanleihen dient. Dies schafft eine solide Vermögensbasis und sichert Vertrauen.
* **2 Millionen CAD stehen für den Geschäftsbetrieb und die Expansion zur Verfügung.** Dies ist das Wachstumskapital, das benötigt wird, um Marketing und Betrieb zu skalieren und Marktanteile von den gestörten Wettbewerbern zu gewinnen.

Diese Struktur bietet sowohl Stabilität als auch Schlagkraft, genau zum Zeitpunkt des Startschusses.

# 5. Die Dimension der Chance: Eine Multi-Milliarden-Dollar-Verschiebung

Um es klar zu sagen: Dies ist keine Nischen-Chance. Wir sprechen über die potenzielle Umleitung von enormen Kapitalströmen. Mit Gold im Wert von **39,2 Milliarden Schweizer Franken**, das in nur sechs Monaten von der Schweiz in die USA floss, wäre selbst die Eroberung eines winzigen Bruchteils dieses Marktes für Tradewind transformativ.

Der globale Goldmarkt hat einen Wert von etwa **13 Billionen US-Dollar**. Der digitale Goldmarkt steckt noch in den Kinderschuhen. Diese Zoll-Disruption ist genau der Katalysator, der notwendig ist, um die Migration vom alten, ineffizienten System zu einem neuen, digitalen und in Nordamerika ansässigen Standard zu beschleunigen.

# Zusammenfassung:

Die Investment-These für den Tradewind-RTO wurde soeben durch externe, geopolitische Kräfte fundamental gestärkt. Wir erleben einen perfekten Sturm: eine Krise in der traditionellen Lieferkette, eine überlegene nordamerikanische Lösung mit staatlicher Rückendeckung (RCM), eine technologisch fortschrittliche Plattform, die zur Skalierung bereit ist, und ein gut strukturierter RTO, der das notwendige Kapital bereitstellt.

Dies ist nicht mehr nur eine Geschichte über Technologie; es ist eine Geschichte darüber, ein entscheidender Teil der nordamerikanischen Edelmetallinfrastruktur zu werden, und zwar genau in dem Moment, in dem sie am dringendsten gebraucht wird.

Beste Grüße

TradeToday

**PS:** Der Markt ist oft langsam darin, die Verbindung zwischen geopolitischen Ereignissen und der Bewertung einer Micro-Cap-Aktie herzustellen. In dieser Diskrepanz zwischen dem Ausmaß dieser Chance und dem aktuellen Aktienkurs liegt das Potenzial für informierte und geduldige Investoren. Dies ist ein fundamentaler Katalysator, keine Spekulation.

*Ich habe die letzten Tage damit verbracht, mich intensiv mit den Auswirkungen dieser potenziellen Zölle zu befassen, und je mehr ich die Situation analysiere, desto klarer wird die Chance. Es fühlt sich an, als würde man ein strategisches Schachspiel beobachten, bei dem ein einziger Zug plötzlich das gesamte Brett zugunsten von Tradewind verändert.*

1mml62l,2025-08-10,"$PSTV – New NCCN Guidelines Just Matched PSTV’s Playbook Step-for-Step
$PSTV – NCCN Just Changed the Rulebook, and PSTV Is the Only Player in This Lane

What happened:
On June 3, 2025, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) released Version 1.2025 of its guidelines for Adult Intracranial and Spinal Ependymomas (Excluding Subependymomas).

For the first time, the follow-up/recurrence pathway now includes:

“CSF–tDNA testing can be considered with CSF cytology to increase sensitivity of tumor cell detection and assessment of residual disease after surgery.”

This wasn’t in prior public 2024 versions — meaning June 3, 2025 is the first official inclusion for this tumor category.

⸻

Why it matters for PSTV:
	•	PSTV’s Rhenium-186 nanoliposome therapy is delivered directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to treat leptomeningeal metastases and other CNS cancers.
	•	CSF–tDNA testing is essentially a “liquid biopsy” of spinal fluid — it finds microscopic traces of tumor DNA.
	•	NCCN now officially recommends this testing to detect residual disease and monitor recurrence.
	•	PSTV’s therapy works in the exact environment this new guideline is targeting — the “test + treat” model is now backed by NCCN.

⸻

First-mover advantage:
PSTV is the only clinical-stage company with this specific combination:
	•	Radiotherapeutic payload (Rhenium-186)
	•	Nanoliposome delivery system
	•	Direct CSF administration for CNS cancers

Other companies may do CSF diagnostics or intrathecal delivery of chemo, but nobody else is combining a targeted radiotherapy with nanoliposome delivery into the CSF.

⸻

Why this is bullish:
	1.	Guideline validation – The testing method that perfectly complements PSTV’s drug delivery is now officially recommended.
	2.	Adoption pathway – Hospitals love treatments that align with guidelines; it smooths approval and reimbursement.
	3.	Better trial metrics – CSF–tDNA gives a measurable way to track PSTV’s effectiveness.
	4.	Market readiness – The rulebook now supports exactly what PSTV is building — before they’ve even commercialized.

⸻

Bottom line:
June 3, 2025, NCCN made a formal change that lands squarely in PSTV’s sweet spot. They are the only player with this tech, and now the standard of care is aligning with their strategy.

1mlcfif,2025-08-09,"$PSTV – FDA Clearance, Texas Rollout, Sustained Volume, and Aug 14–16 Conference
$PSTV has been drawing unusual attention lately, combining confirmed company developments with heavy trading activity and an upcoming scheduled catalyst.

 Aug 14–16 – SNO/ASCO CNS Metastases Conference
PSTV is confirmed to present:
	•	Two CNSide® Presentations – Data on detecting and quantifying tumor cells in cerebrospinal fluid for leptomeningeal metastases (LM), including breast cancer and NSCLC patients.
	•	REYOBIQ™ Phase 1/2 Trial Update – Safety and efficacy results for LM.
	•	Educational Symposium – “Reimagining Your Approach to LM”, featuring leading neuro-oncologists discussing CNSide and REYOBIQ.
	•	CNSide’s rollout into Texas hospitals is expected to be part of the discussion — a notable early commercial step in a major medical market.

 Volume & Float
	•	Float: ~60M shares.
	•	June 24: 121M shares traded (~2× float) after cancelling potential issuance of up to 1.5B warrant-linked shares, removing a large dilution overhang.
	•	June 25: 741M shares traded (~12× float) the day after FDA IND clearance for REYOBIQ™ in childhood brain cancer.
	•	This week (Aug 4–8): 126.6M shares traded (~2× float) as the conference approaches.
	•	Accumulation Observation: Over the past five trading days, more than 126 million shares have traded — over twice the float — with a large portion of that activity occurring between roughly $0.62 and $0.90. Sustained, high-volume trading in a defined range often points to strong interest from committed holders rather than short-term flipping.

 Price Action
	•	+126% in the past month.
	•	+60% this week.
	•	Daily multi-million share volume with consistent churn.

Why It Stands Out
Recently, PSTV has:
	1.	Removed a multi-billion-share dilution threat.
	2.	Received FDA clearance for a high-need cancer therapy IND.
	3.	Begun rolling out CNSide in Texas hospitals.

With the Aug 14–16 conference ahead, the company has a defined platform to present clinical and commercial updates to both the medical community and investors.

Bottom Line:
PSTV has the float, the volume history, and recent trading pattern to support a potential move if upcoming presentations resonate. With multiple confirmed developments and a catalyst just days away, it’s a setup worth watching closely.

GLTA invested! 
Respectfully, if it was already FDA approved, it wouldn't be a pennystock. I am personally going long on this stock. It has the potential to run hard once key catalysts hit. Analysts are predicting an average target near $10 — lol, I’m parking my 50k shares, setting my alerts, and not looking back! And honestly, when I think about it, I just hope that somewhere down the line this drug helps someone who truly needs it. If backing the company helps bring it to market, then I’m helping too, right? One could only hope! Vs being a shorter and hoping to drive this.potentially life saving Bio company into the ground! In my honest opinion that is just very bad karma! I would rather sleep well at night thank you very much! Peace out! 2000 shares in.  Hoping for a pop during that conference been in since .30, up 125%. easily gonna break 52 week high in coming weeks I might be looking to positively but this is the first major step in bringing REYOBIQ™ to market , and it’s now in motion. Was it approved for cancer treatments REYOBIQ™ is not FDA-approved for cancer treatment yet.

It’s currently an investigational therapy in Phase 1/2 clinical trials for leptomeningeal metastases (a complication of certain cancers).
	•	The FDA IND clearance they received allows them to run these human trials in the U.S.
	•	IND clearance is not the same as full approval for commercial cancer treatment — that only comes after successful trials and a formal New Drug Application review. Time will tell for sure we’ll see! But I am optimistic after doing some serious DD into this Lesss gooo If you are going to mention PSTV, you should also tell others that there is a risk of 2:1 reverse split if the catalyst fails to bring the stock to 1 dollar and keep it 1 dollar for nasdaq compliance. Going in at any price above 80 cents is a substantial risk in my opinion. At least the low split ratio of 2:1 shows the confidence that the company has that it won't drop below 50 cents no matter what before the compliance due date, but that only means people who invested when this company was below 50 cents are safe for the upcoming catalysts.

1mkz4pu,2025-08-08,"Hear me out on TLRY
Summary

Upgrading Tilray Brands to Buy due to improved valuation, net cash position, and technical support near recent lows, despite ongoing volatility and sector headwinds.
Q4 results showed mixed performance: revenue missed expectations but adjusted EBITDA beat; cannabis margins improved, though overall growth remains challenging.
Valuation is attractive, trading below tangible book value and at under 10x FY26 projected adjusted EBITDA, limiting downside risk versus peers.
Key risks include potential reverse split, further M&A, and regulatory uncertainty in U.S. THC beverages, but risk/reward now favors a Buy rating on TLRY stock. I was not a fan of the stock of Tilray Brands (NASDAQ:TLRY) (TSX:TLRY:CA) for a long time, and it finally fell a ton. I upgraded it to Neutral too early in December at $1.19, and then, after it fell further, I upgraded it to Buy too early in February at $0.93. I upgraded it to Strong Buy in March, when it was $0.61. The stock is now below that level, but I stuck with it all the way down to an all-time low set in June at $0.35.
TLRY rallied very big after that all-time low, and I downgraded the stock to Neutral on July 10th, when the stock was $0.67. In that article, I disclosed that my model portfolio at 420 Investor had a 4.6% position, which was below its weight in the index I aim to beat, the New Cannabis Ventures Global Cannabis Stock Index. After the article, the stock, which was at $0.69 when I was writing it, traded above $0.80 on July 23rd. I ended up exiting the position from my model portfolio on 7/14 at a price of $0.628 to add to another Canadian LP.

As I discuss below, TLRY has been very volatile. Today, I want to discuss why I bought it back in the model portfolio this past week after it reported its fiscal Q4 financials. It is currently 11.7% of the model portfolio, the 4th largest of 8 positions. The index weighting for TLRY is 5.6%, so I am overweight the stock relative to the index. I currently hold three Canadian LPs that total 35.4% of the portfolio versus a 32.8% Canadian LP exposure in the index across 7 names.

The TLRY Chart Suggests a Low Was Set

TLRY is currently down 57.2% in 2025 so far, while the Global Cannabis Stock Index has dropped 22.1%. Here are the last six months of trading, which includes the fiscal Q3 report on April 8th and this past week's Q4 report:

This week, the stock gapped down after the earnings were released, setting a low of the week on that day of $0.551, which was matched on Friday. $0.55 seems to me to be support, but there is a lot of room below. Interestingly, this is where the stock was right before it reported its Q3. My second support of $0.50 is not only a nice round number but also where the rising 50-day moving average currently is. On the resistance, my first level is $0.70, which is above the gap and right at the falling 150-day moving average.

Taking a longer-term perspective, the big loss this year follows a big loss from the peak set right after the IPO:

The stock is 96.7% below the $17 IPO price and more than 99% below its all-time high.

While the 71.4% loss over the past year for TLRY is huge, it is not the worst performance. Canopy Growth (CGC), which I do not like at all, has dropped by 84.5%. All of the other LPs are down except for Village Farms (VFF), which just joined the index at the end of June. The two other LPs that I include in my model portfolio are the best performers of the remaining stocks in the index, which has declined by 40.2% during that timeframe.

Tilray's Q4 Had Some Positives

The company was expected, according to Koyfin, to have revenue in Q4 of $233.3 million with adjusted EBITDA of $23.7 million. It reported through a press release that revenue was below this level at $224.5 million, down 2% from a year earlier. Adjusted EBITDA exceeded expectations at $27.6 million, down 6%.

Before I discuss the report in more detail, I want to point out that the report looks really bad compared to a year ago, but I thought the report a year ago was too high when it was reported, as I discussed in early September. In that article, which had a Strong Sell rating for the stock, which was then $1.66, I pointed out that M&A was driving the overall growth and was likely not sustainable.

Looking at Q4 closer, revenue fell despite M&A. Again, I think the company does a poor job of disclosing its organic growth. The company has four segments. I have been most interested in its cannabis segment, and in Q4 it was the second-largest segment with revenue of 30% that fell 6% from a year earlier. It breaks down cannabis revenue by business, and Canadian medical cannabis fell slightly and represented 9% of cannabis revenue. Net revenue for adult use represented 55% of cannabis sales, and it fell 6% from a year earlier. Wholesale was just 3% of cannabis sales and plunged 83%. The company did see a gain in its international cannabis, which grew 71% and represented 33% of cannabis sales.

Looking at the other 70% of revenue, the beverage business, at 29% of revenue, experienced a decline of 14%, and this was increased by an acquisition. Its pharmaceutical distribution business, at 32% of revenue, grew 10%, though it has a very low margin. The fourth business, hemp for wellness, and at 8% of overall revenue, grew 10% too.

The company does not give operating profits by segment, though it does share gross profits by division. Its reported gross margin in cannabis was 44%, and its beverage gross margin was 38%. The cannabis gross margin increased from 40% a year earlier, while the beverage gross margin fell sharply from 53%. The distribution gross margin was flat at 12%, while the small hemp wellness products improved from 31% to 33%.

For the full year, gross margin for TLRY was reported at 29%, up from 28% in FY24. On an adjusted basis for price-accounting step-ups, gross margin fell from 30% to 29%. By operating segment, cannabis fell from 36% to 33%, beverage fell from 46% to 39%, distribution was flat at 11%, and hemp wellness rose from 30% to 32%.

In fiscal Q4, the company reported a use of cash of $12.8 million, which was in stark contrast to the generation of $30.7 million in FY24-Q4. This looks bad, but it accounts for most of the change in full-year operating cash flow, which deteriorated by $63.6 million to -$94.6 million.

As I pointed out in my bullish articles previously, the company has substantially reduced debt. The press release and the 10-K showed that total debt ended Q4 at $256.9 million, slightly higher than the cash and marketable securities at $256.4 million. Well, looking at the 10-K, it is apparent that the company now has net cash of $14.8 million.

How did the company, which is using cash in its operations, get to a position of net cash? The sale of stock! During the quarter, it sold more stock through its A-T-M program. For the year, it sold shares to raise $161.2 million (an average net price during FY25 of $1.15 per share). It issued stock during the year to pay off debt too. Its 10-K reveals that in June, which is part of FY26, it has issued 12.6 million shares to pay off $5 million of convertible debt and has sold 25.7 million shares for net $10.3 million. These shares were included in the share count reported by the company.

I am not sure if it matters much, but the CEO and the CFO who bought stock after the report seem to agree. CEO Irwin Simon bought 165K shares at $0.6067, and CFO Carl Merton added 33.5K shares at $0.5952.

The Outlook for TLRY Is Strong

Going into the report, analysts were expecting total revenue of $875.3 million in FY26 and then $918.6 million in FY27. For adjusted EBITDA, they were projecting $72.3 million in FY26 and then $93.9 million. In a preview for my 420 Investor members, I shared my view that the adjusted EBITDA outlook was too high and built my price targets on adjusted EBITDA of $65.6 million for FY26 and then $73.5 million for FY27. Those were based on margins of 7.5% and then 8.0%.

Currently, analysts project that FY26 revenue will increase 5% to $863.9 million, which is 1% lower than their prior outlook. Adjusted EBITDA is currently projected at $68.2 million, a margin of 7.9% and up 24%. EPS is projected to be $0.04. For FY27, they project revenue will increase 4% to $902.1 million with adjusted EBITDA up 26% to $85.8 million. This is a projected adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.5%. EPS is projected at $0.06.

I think projecting revenue for TLRY is very difficult, and like that, the revenue projections aren't down substantially despite the miss in Q4. I continue to view the adjusted EBITDA margins as perhaps too aggressive. Tilray Brands had stopped giving adjusted EBITDA outlooks, but it did share an internal projection for FY26 of $62-72 million. Again, I am looking for about a 7.5% margin, which would be $64.8 million, which is below the current consensus. For FY27, my 8% would be $72.2 million. Note that the adjusted EBITDA in FY25 was $55.0 million, down 9% and a margin of 6.7%.

TLRY Has a Good Valuation

When I downgraded TLRY in July, I pointed out that it was trading at a price to tangible book value of 1.2X, but it is currently lower. The price fell, which helps, but the tangible book value increased. The stock trades at just 0.9X. For a company that has no net debt, trading at a discount to tangible book value suggests downside risk being limited. With that said, the company does have debt still and sees its tangible book value decline.

A better way to assess the valuation is to look at its enterprise value to projected adjusted EBITDA. With a market cap of $643 million, it has an enterprise value of $628 million and is trading at less than 10X FY26 adjusted EBITDA projections, which seems low. Based on the FY26 projected EPS, it trades at just 14PE.

I cover TLRY and four of its peers. Here is the table that I shared yesterday for the five companies based on year-end 2026 estimates:

All 5 of these companies trade below tangible book value, and only CGC has net debt. Cronos Group (CRON), which I own in the model portfolio, has negative enterprise value, with its cash higher than its market cap. TLRY, trading at 7.8X, has the highest enterprise value to projected calendar 2026 adjusted EBITDA, but it does not seem out of line with its peers.

As I discussed above, I am using lower adjusted EBITDA numbers than the analysts are predicting. In my July 10th article, I shared a one-year target of $0.90 based on 10X. I am now using 12X for this federally legal company, but the higher share count and lower adjusted EBITDA level suggest $0.78 for a year from now. Based on the EPS estimate, this would be 13PE. An enterprise value to projected adjusted EBITDA of 10X would be $0.65, which is up 14%.

Risks to TLRY

Tilray has some good things working for it, but there are risks. First, while I don't see any risk to doing a reverse split, many investors and traders don't like reverse splits. TLRY will need to do one to avoid being delisted by the NASDAQ.

As I have discussed before, TLRY, which has done a lot of M&A, could do more acquisitions. This action could be positive, but it could also degrade the balance sheet. Further, it could do a bad acquisition.

Finally, while I am excited about the potential for the company in THC beverages in the U.S., some states are pushing back. Further, there is a risk that the federal government takes action that could hurt the category as well. While the company does not disclose its sales levels of these products, wiping them out could hurt future growth.

Conclusion

As I discussed above, TLRY is a volatile stock. It is also a large cannabis company that has been historically popular with traders and investors. There are 138K followers at . For those who want to be invested in cannabis, I think TLRY is one of the better ideas now and am upgrading my rating from Neutral to Buy.

Again, the chart is looking better, and the valuation looks attractive. Importantly, the company has moved to net cash from net debt. While the price is much lower than it was when I first gave it a Strong Buy and somewhat lower than where I downgraded it to Neutral, it is up a lot from the recent low. I shared a target that would represent a 37% gain over the next year. Good enough for Buy but not good enough for Strong Buy!

Shitray Has anyone been pumping $SNDL too? I hope not, pumping TLRY and SNDL are 2 of the signs of the marketacolypse Trump just said something about cannabis like an hour ago. I'm heavily invested in TLRY for a couple years now and... Well, let's just say I'm holding and hoping.

# Signals for PRGN-2012’s FDA Decision – Recent Sentiment & Market Indicators







# Analyst Sentiment & Target Price Changes





**Strong Bullish Consensus:** Wall Street analysts covering Precigen (PGEN) have been notably optimistic in recent weeks. The stock carries a *Buy/Outperform* consensus, and several analysts have reiterated or raised their targets ahead of the FDA decision:



* **Stifel:** Reiterated a Buy rating and raised their price target to **$10** (from $7) after positive PRGN-2012 trial data . This bullish target reflects high confidence in approval and market potential.
* **JMP Securities:** Recently **reaffirmed a “Market Outperform”** rating with a **$6.00** price target, citing optimism about PRGN-2012’s prospects .
* **Cantor Fitzgerald:** Maintains an **Overweight** rating (previous target around $7) , remaining positive on the stock.
* *Consensus:* The average analyst target now sits in the **$6–7** range, which implies a **200–300%+ upside** from the current \~$1.8 share price . This bullish consensus suggests that analysts largely **expect FDA approval**, as such upside would likely materialize only if PRGN-2012 reaches the market successfully. Notably, one data point even shows a prior “sell” rating being upgraded to “hold” in July – indicating that even the more skeptical observers have turned neutral or positive as the review progresses. No analysts have issued new downgrades or negative reports in the last few weeks. Overall, Wall Street sentiment points toward **confidence in approval** (and significant commercial value), with little evidence of analyst pessimism.







# Institutional Investor & Insider Movements





**Smart Money Positioning:** Recent ownership moves suggest that both insiders and some institutional investors are positioning for a favorable outcome. Key signals include:



* **High Insider Ownership:** Precigen’s insiders (management and directors) collectively hold over **50%** of the stock – a very large stake that aligns insiders’ interests with shareholders. This includes founder Randal J. Kirk, who alone owns roughly half the company. Insider ownership has even ticked up slightly in 2025 (e.g. minor increases from stock grants) . Crucially, there have been *no significant insider sales* ahead of the FDA decision. In fact, one board director **exercised options to acquire \~126,760 shares in early July** (at effectively $0 cost) , increasing her holding. The CEO and other top executives were likewise granted stock and options in June and have retained them . This lack of selling – and continued insider holding – is generally interpreted as a **positive signal** that those closest to the company are optimistic (insiders typically would avoid buying or would sell down if they anticipated a negative outcome).
* **Institutional Accumulation:** While PGEN is a small-cap, several biotech-focused funds have modest positions that they’ve recently increased. For example, Adage Capital Partners (a prominent healthcare hedge fund) holds about **11.3 million shares** (\~3.8% of PGEN) as of Q1 2025 . Adage slightly **added** to its stake in that quarter , a sign of growing conviction. Other institutions like **BlackRock** and **Vanguard** also upped their holdings by a few hundred thousand shares each in late 2024/early 2025 . Total institutional ownership has climbed to roughly **27–33%** of the float , up from previous levels (Finviz notes a +7.3% increase in institutional positions recently) . The fact that major biotech investors and index funds are not cutting exposure – and indeed some are buying – in the lead-up to the PDUFA suggests **expectations of approval** (or at least a lack of serious concern about rejection). It’s also worth noting that Precigen raised **$79 million in new financing** at the end of 2024 to secure its cash runway through an anticipated 2025 launch . This capital raise was led in part by insiders (including Randal Kirk) and supportive investors. It indicates confidence in PRGN-2012, and it means the company likely **won’t need to dilute shareholders again before the FDA decision**, reducing a risk that often concerns institutions.
* **No Bearish Insider Signals:** There have been no Form-4 filings in recent weeks suggesting insider selling or cautious moves. On the contrary, insiders appear to be “all in” on PRGN-2012’s success. High insider ownership (roughly **61% per some estimates** when including insider-affiliated entities) has been highlighted by investors as a bullish factor – management’s fortunes are tied to the drug’s outcome. All of this implies that those with the most knowledge have **not signaled any red flags**; if anything, their actions convey optimism and commitment.







# Biotech Forums & Expert Speculation





**Buzz in Biotech Communities:** In online biotech investor communities, **speculation is running high** that PRGN-2012 will secure FDA approval – and possibly attract big-pharma interest. While informal, these discussions provide insight into market sentiment among dedicated investors and even industry consultants:



* On Reddit’s biotech and penny stock forums, some users have been extremely bullish. One detailed post called Precigen *“the sleeper biotech of 2025”* and noted the **“asymmetric upside”** of the August PDUFA catalyst . The author pointed to PRGN-2012’s game-changing potential in a rare disease and the stock’s low valuation, arguing that a positive outcome could rerate the stock dramatically. In fact, **retail bulls have floated astronomical upside scenarios** – for instance, a discussion thread speculated on “**1400% potential**” upside and a possible *“bidding war”* for Precigen if PRGN-2012 is approved . (Such outsized figures assume that if PRGN-2012 becomes the first approved therapy for RRP, larger biopharma companies might vie to acquire Precigen for its platform and revenue potential.) This is admittedly **hyperbolic**, but it underscores the *excitement* in some quarters.
* **Merck Involvement Rumors:** Notably, that same Reddit discussion highlighted that **Merck** (the pharma giant) reportedly owns **\~8%** of Precigen . This appears to refer to a historical equity stake – indeed, Merck KGaA had a partnership with Precigen’s predecessor and took an equity position years ago. If Merck or its affiliates still hold a significant stake, forum commenters see it as a sign that *“Big Pharma is watching.”* Some speculate Merck could be a logical commercial partner or acquirer if PRGN-2012 is approved. While this is informal chatter, the idea that a major pharma has a foot in the door adds to positive sentiment (investors often view strategic pharma stakes as votes of confidence). It’s also been noted that **insider/founder Randal Kirk has a history of selling companies** (he previously sold Intrexon’s energy business and other ventures) – fueling talk that a *buyout could follow approval* if the data and market look compelling.
* **Regulatory Experts’ Views:** On platforms like **Twitter (X)** and investor conferences, biotech regulatory consultants have weighed in more pragmatically. The consensus of those watching the FDA seems to be that **there is no obvious reason for rejection** at this stage. PRGN-2012 addresses a serious unmet need (no approved therapies for RRP) and showed strong efficacy (50%+ complete response rate) with benign safety in trials. Some experts have noted that the FDA **rarely denies approval to a Breakthrough-designated therapy** with a positive pivotal trial in a rare disease – unless there are manufacturing or safety issues. As one poster put it, *“What’s the bear case? The data are great, the patients have no alternatives.”* The main caution they raise is *CMC (Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls)* considerations, which can trip up gene therapies. However, **Precigen’s public communications give no indication of CMC trouble** – quite the opposite, as discussed below, the company claims to be ready on the manufacturing front. Thus, the qualitative sentiment from knowledgeable observers skews **optimistic**: most believe the FDA is inclined to approve PRGN-2012, barring an unforeseen issue. In sum, the biotech community buzz is that Precigen is on the cusp of a breakthrough, and many are positioning accordingly (though a few skeptics urge caution until the FDA’s letter is in hand).







# FDA Review Patterns & Regulatory Signals





**Clues from the FDA Process:** Several subtle signals in the regulatory review process itself point toward a likely approval for PRGN-2012:



* **No Advisory Committee Meeting:** The FDA did **not convene an advisory committee (AdCom)** to review PRGN-2012 . In Precigen’s press release and conference calls, they confirmed that *“the FDA has indicated they are not planning to hold an advisory committee meeting”* for this BLA . Skipping an AdCom is often interpreted as a *green flag*. Typically, the FDA calls an external expert panel when there are significant questions on safety, efficacy, or trial design that warrant public discussion. The absence of an AdCom suggests the agency saw **no major controversies or deficiencies** in Precigen’s data package that required outside input. While not a guarantee, this usually means the review is proceeding smoothly. (For context, in recent years the FDA has increasingly foregone AdComs for many approvals – by 2021, only \~6% of drug approvals went to an AdCom – but for a first-in-class gene therapy, *having no AdCom is a positive sign* that the FDA isn’t raising red flags.)
* **Priority Review & Breakthrough Status:** PRGN-2012 was granted **Breakthrough Therapy** designation and received **Priority Review**, with a 6-month review clock and an **August 27, 2025 PDUFA date** . These designations signal that the FDA considers the therapy to offer a major advance for a serious condition. Priority Review shortens the timeline and implies the FDA will devote resources to expedite the decision. In practice, drugs with these statuses have a higher likelihood of approval, as the FDA has essentially agreed the drug addresses an *unmet need*. The fact that the FDA did *not* extend the review timeline or announce any delays so far indicates the review is on track.
* **Regulatory Alignment on Data Requirements:** Precigen’s management has repeatedly emphasized that they designed the PRGN-2012 clinical program *in close consultation with the FDA*. The pivotal Phase 1/2 trial’s primary endpoint (proportion of patients with complete response – i.e., no surgeries needed for 12+ months) was **prospectively defined and agreed upon with FDA input** . Importantly, the trial met this primary efficacy endpoint with highly significant results: a **51% complete response rate** versus the pre-specified success threshold (which was lower) . All complete responders remained surgery-free, with responses durable out to 3 years in many cases . Because the endpoint and required effect size were set in alignment with FDA, *hitting those marks bodes very well* – it suggests Precigen delivered exactly what regulators asked for to deem the drug effective. In essence, PRGN-2012 checked the efficacy box convincingly, and the FDA was already on board with the trial design.
* **Accelerated Approval Path & Confirmatory Trial:** The FDA appears open to granting **accelerated approval** for PRGN-2012 based on the Phase 2 data. Precigen has disclosed that, at the FDA’s guidance, they **initiated a confirmatory Phase 3 trial** in parallel, even before approval . Notably, the confirmatory trial design is *quite favorable*: it’s **single-arm (no placebo)**, targeting \~35 additional patients . This implies the FDA did *not* require a large randomized Phase 3 before approval – a huge indicator of confidence. A single-arm confirmatory study is usually used only when the FDA is already convinced by existing data and just needs more safety or durability information post-approval. The fact that enrollment is ongoing and no placebo control is needed shows the FDA likely agrees there’s no ethical equipoise (since surgery vs. drug is not a true “placebo” comparison – the drug’s benefit is clear enough). In summary, the regulatory pathway (rolling BLA submission, priority review, small confirmatory study) strongly suggests that **FDA is favorably disposed to approve now** under accelerated approval, with final confirmation of benefits to come from that follow-up study .
* **Manufacturing & CMC Preparedness:** A common pitfall for gene therapies can be chemistry/manufacturing issues, which sometimes lead to FDA **Complete Response Letters (CRLs)** even for efficacious drugs. However, Precigen has signaled that it has its manufacturing in order. In a recent earnings call, the COO detailed their preparations: Precigen built an **in-house GMP manufacturing facility** for the adenovirus-based product back in 2019 and has already produced all clinical supply there . The facility was **upgraded for commercial production** and process validation has been **completed in alignment with FDA requirements** . They also enlisted a reputable contract manufacturer for final fill-finish steps . Precigen stated they are *“confident in \[their\] ability to supply PRGN-2012 to meet anticipated demand at launch”* . This is a significant de-risking: it suggests that by the time of the BLA submission, Precigen had met the FDA’s CMC expectations (they even noted all required validation data were in the BLA). **No news of manufacturing deficiencies** has emerged during the review – usually, if there were CMC issues, the company might have signaled delays or the FDA might have convened an expert panel. Instead, silence on this front and the company’s bullish statements imply that **CMC is unlikely to derail approval**. This aligns with FDA’s broader push to facilitate gene therapy approvals; the agency has beefed up its review staff for gene therapies and indicated back in 2019 that by 2025 it expects to approve **10–20 cell/gene therapies per year** . All signs indicate PRGN-2012 could be one of those, given that it seems to satisfy the FDA’s efficacy and manufacturing standards so far.





In summary, the regulatory **tea leaves read positive**: a cooperative FDA, no advisory panel, and an approval pathway clearly laid out. These factors strongly hint that an FDA *green light* is more likely than not.





# Market Trading Activity & Volume Spikes





**Anticipation and Hedging in the Market:** Trading patterns in Precigen’s stock over the last few weeks show heightened activity – consistent with investors jockeying ahead of the FDA decision. Some of these signals can hint at sentiment:



* **Volume and Price Action:** In late July and early August, PGEN stock experienced **surges in trading volume** alongside price gains. For instance, on one day the share price jumped to about **$1.78** (near a multi-year high) and trading volume exceeded **3 million shares**, vs. an average of \~1.96M . Over that week, the stock was up roughly 5–10%. This above-average volume suggests **accumulation by investors positioning for the FDA outcome** – essentially, increased demand for shares as traders speculate on approval. The stock’s 50-day and 200-day moving averages have been trending upward (currently around $1.57 and $1.55 respectively ), reflecting the strong rally in 2025 (year-to-date the stock is >50% higher ). Such momentum indicates that the market, in general, is leaning bullish on PRGN-2012’s prospects. The price hasn’t “sold off” or remained flat – it has strengthened as the decision nears, which is usually a sign that **investors expect good news** (or at least are not fearing bad news enough to exit positions).
* **Spike in Put Option Buying (Hedging):** At the same time, there has been a remarkable jump in options activity, specifically **put options** (which profit if the stock falls). In the last week of July, traders bought **5,477 put contracts** on PGEN in a single session – **a 284% increase** over the typical daily put volume . This *unusually large* put purchase did not coincide with a drop in the stock; in fact, as noted, the stock was rising. Such activity often points to **hedging by investors** who are long the stock and want protection, or speculative bets by others anticipating volatility. In context, it likely means that some fund or traders who are bullish overall still wanted **insurance against a negative FDA outcome** (e.g., a rejection or delay that would crash the stock). Buying puts is a way to guard against a potential *“worst-case scenario”* without selling the core position. It could also be outright bearish speculation, but given the stock rose on heavy volume, hedging by longs is a reasonable interpretation. This indicates a note of **caution** underlying the optimism – even bulls acknowledge there is never 100% certainty with the FDA. The presence of put hedging suggests that *while most signals are positive, the market is not completely discounting risk*. There’s awareness that if, for some reason, the FDA issues a Complete Response Letter (rejection), the downside could be severe, so prudent investors are preparing for both outcomes.
* **High Short Interest:** Another related signal is the persistently **high short interest** in PGEN shares. Currently, about **19–20% of the float is sold short** , which equals \~28 million shares shorted . That is a sizeable short position. Interestingly, short interest has not drastically decreased going into the FDA decision (often shorts would cover if they feared an approval rally). This could mean a couple of things: some short-sellers might be betting that **if approval happens, the stock is already priced for it or the company might face challenges (like commercialization or needing more cash)**, thus limiting upside. Alternatively, some shorts might believe the FDA could surprise with a negative decision (perhaps they are skeptical of the single-trial data or have concerns about manufacturing that the bulls ignore). It’s also possible that a portion of the short interest is **hedging by convertible note holders or arbitrage strategies**, not pure bearish bets. Regardless, the relatively large short position implies there is a **contingent of investors taking a contrarian view** or hedging heavily. From a sentiment perspective, this is a **mixed signal**: it injects some doubt into an otherwise optimistic picture. On the flip side, such high short interest sets the stage for a *short squeeze* – if PRGN-2012 gets approved and the stock jumps, shorts may rush to cover, potentially amplifying gains. In other words, the shorts represent pent-up pessimism that could quickly unwind on good news, which bullish investors actually view as a positive catalyst.
* **Overall Market Behavior:** The combination of rising share price, strong volume, and increased options hedging paints a picture of a market that is **gearing up for a pivotal event**. The net bias appears positive (price and volume action), but with a protective overlay (puts and shorts) acknowledging binary risk. It’s common before big FDA decisions to see this kind of dual behavior: speculators and investors buying shares for the upside, while more cautious players ensure they’re covered against downside. Importantly, no mass sell-off or exit is evident – which we *would* likely see if there were whispers of trouble. In fact, the stock’s resilience suggests **no leakage of bad news**; if anything, the steady climb could hint that many expect a favorable outcome.







# Summary & Sentiment Outlook





In the weeks leading up to the August 27 PDUFA decision, **the balance of signals tilts toward an FDA approval for PRGN-2012**. Both formal and informal indicators convey a generally *bullish* sentiment: Wall Street analysts have raised targets and uniformly expect success , significant shareholders (from biotech hedge funds to Precigen’s own insiders) have been **buying or holding**, not selling , and the company and FDA’s actions (priority review, no AdCom, aligned trial endpoints) all point to a smooth review process . On investor forums, optimism runs high – even to speculative extremes – reflecting a view that PRGN-2012 could be a **transformative therapy** for a rare disease and a big win for the company. At the same time, the presence of hedging and short interest shows a thread of **caution**: some stakeholders are managing risk, aware that nothing is guaranteed until the FDA’s decision is final. This prudent caution does not so much indicate a belief that approval is unlikely, but rather acknowledgment of the stakes.



Crucially, we have not seen any negative development (such as FDA extending the review, safety alarms, or insider dumping of shares) in the recent period – **no “smoke” that would hint at fire**. The informal clues – like trading patterns and message board chatter – align with the formal narrative that **Precigen is on track**. If PRGN-2012 gets approved, Precigen stands to have the first-ever therapy for RRP, and the market’s positioning suggests many are betting on that outcome. Conversely, a surprise rejection would catch a portion of the market off guard (as evidenced by how much upside analysts and investors have priced in), though the hedges in place would soften the blow for some.



Overall, the **informal sentiment is optimistic**: the weight of recent signals – analyst commentary, investor positioning, and lack of red flags – leans toward an expectation that the FDA will **approve PRGN-2012**. The subtle cues from the FDA’s handling of the review further bolster this outlook. In summary, while one should always be prepared for surprises in biotech, the current tea leaves suggest that Precigen’s PRGN-2012 has a strong chance of earning the FDA’s nod, with the market **quietly upbeat** (if cautiously so) about that prospect. All eyes will be on late August for confirmation of these signals.
I’m also long on PGEN for pretty much the reasons outlined above with the added bit that FDA approval validates their adenoviral delivery platform.  Most delivery uses adeno-associated viruses (AAV) which have some pretty severe limitations but they use adenovirus.  Their adenovirus is derived from gorillas which sounds weird, but it actually means that unlike with AAV, the vast majority of humans don’t have antibodies against this virus so can be treated with it.  It also enables repeat treatment, which often isn’t possible with AAV.

I think this gives them massive upside beyond the immediate gain should they get FDA approval.  Drug/gene/cell delivery is a huge field and this could have a really big impact. Yeah I’ve been doing exactly this.  There was an uptake in short interest about a week ago that dropped it to 1.5ish and I bought then.  Next dip I’ll do the same, all just noise before the FDA approval Yap yap yap. 🤖 Earnings next week and today is going down.. probably will go down even more after earnings and that might be a good time to buy it. Huh, dug in a little and this does look interesting. It hasn’t run up yet, either, unlike much of what’s posted here. I assume there will be a ton of volatility leading up to the FDA decision so it will probably be up and down from here in hard-to-predict ways, but presumably it’d get a nice boost at approval. Seems like this might be one to DCA in then set stop loss in the days leading up to 8/27 The bots are yapping again 😒 The only thing that worries me is the share short. I think shorts pushing a stock down after positive news is probably a more common phenomenon than positive momentum forcing a squeeze. Lost some cash on NGENF this year in exactly that situation despite success on its primary end point. There was an initial spike then it was completely wiped out (I assume algo trades and stop loss kicked in and made it 10x worse). Could happen here if any news isn’t totally unambiguous Yeah that’s a good point, though there usually isn’t much ambiguity with FDA approval.  There can be if it’s only approved for a subset of cases, but I’m not sure what they are treating is common or complex enough for them to run into that.  So unlike clinical trials, I think is really pretty binary.

1mky5q8,2025-08-08,"Eco Wave Power ($WAVE) Installs Core Energy Conversion Unit at Port of Los Angeles
Eco Wave Power (NASDAQ: WAVE) just put in its Energy Conversion Unit at the Port of Los Angeles which is a big step toward testing its first ever US wave energy pilot...Btw maybe not a pennystock per-se but their market cap is super small so id say it fits in here

The ECU is the heart of their onshore system. It turns the up and down motion of waves into clean electricity and it does it without drilling into the seabed or building anything heavy in the water. With this now in place the project moves from building to getting ready for operation. They are finishing the hydraulic and electrical connections now and plan to show it all off on September 9

Main project highlights:  
\- First US pilot for Eco Wave Power hosted by AltaSea at the Port of Los Angeles  
\- nuilt to help with environmental checks and make it easier to work with regulators and to show off the tech to officials industry people and potential partners  
\- Local companies involved  
\- All-Ways Metal a woman-owned california shop made the floaters which went in at the end of July 2025  
\- Backed by Shells Marine Renewable Program which adds extra industry credibility

Watch for:  
September 9th 2025 when they officially open the project with US and California officials clean energy leaders and media from around the world. It is set to be a big showcase of what onshore wave energy can do and why WAVE is seen as a pioneer in this space
Been watching this for awhile. It’ll go places

1mk50f0,2025-08-07,"Gold Resource Corp (GORO) Will be a $30 stock again. Currently trading at .50cents
In 2011 during the last bull run in Gold & Silver it was over $30 and now it's at .50 cents. Same company but better positioned.

Extremely Undervalued Stock with Significant Upside Potential

* Current Price vs. Analyst Targets: GORO is trading at approximately $0.51 per share, with a 52-week range of $0.12 to $0.82. Analysts, including H.C. Wainwright, have set a 12-month price target of $1.25 to $1.50, suggesting an upside potential of 101% to 194%. This indicates the stock may be significantly undervalued based on its operational and growth prospects.
* Market Opportunity: Gold and silver prices have been bolstered by geopolitical uncertainties and inflation concerns, positioning GORO to benefit as a producer of these safe-haven assets. With a market cap of around $69.74 million, GORO is a small-cap stock with room for growth as investor interest in precious metals rises.

Strong Operational Foundation

* Core Assets: GORO operates the Don David Gold Mine (DDGM) in Oaxaca, Mexico, producing gold, silver, copper, lead, and zinc. The discovery of the Three Sisters vein system at DDGM has led to an 800% increase in mineral reserves (526,152 tonnes), showcasing significant resource expansion and operational potential.
* Strategic Financing: GORO recently secured a $6.3 million debt facility to develop the Three Sisters vein system with minimal shareholder dilution. This prudent financial strategy supports growth while preserving equity value.
* Exploration Potential: The company’s Back Forty project in Michigan, covering 1,304 hectares, adds diversification with potential for high-return, low-capital-expenditure projects. This dual-asset strategy mitigates risk and enhances long-term growth prospects.

Positive Technical and Market Signals

* Short-Term Trends: GORO is in a strong rising trend in the short term, with analysts forecasting a 23.07% price increase over the next three months, supported by a 90% probability of holding between $0.463 and $0.81. Technical indicators, such as a buy signal from the 3-month Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), suggest positive momentum.
* Analyst Sentiment: The consensus rating is Moderate Buy, with one analyst issuing a Strong Buy rating and no sell ratings, reflecting confidence in GORO’s outlook.

Positioned for Macro Trends

* Safe-Haven Demand: Geopolitical risks and inflationary pressures are driving demand for gold and silver, which GORO produces. Posts on X highlight bullish sentiment toward precious metals, with some investors noting gold’s role as a hedge against economic uncertainty.
* Low Beta: With a beta of 0.83, GORO exhibits lower volatility than the broader market, making it an attractive option for risk-averse investors seeking exposure to precious metals
Commenting to come back later when smarter people than me leave some comments Not smarter but GORO is a cool ticker. Mortal Kombat 1, Goro was cool af back when.  Did some quick DD:

This company has been in the red for a bit and has almost no cash. They're borderline illiquid. They own gold mines but their current extraction costs exceed the price of gold itself per ounce.

Their leadership appears to be banking on some inflow of capital to upgrade their equipment/process to lower their mining cost (ideally well below the current price of gold).

If they can manage to pull that off, obviously gold is always a valuable asset, and I believe gold isn't even close to it's maximum value yet. The world's confidence in the dollar is eroding, recession is looming, and people need a thing they can trade that they feel they can trust in these circumstances.

That said... invest with caution. This one is probably 10/90 boom to bust. They're bordering on capitulation, but they have some path to glory if gold price keeps surging and they can make the necessary investments to get their production costs in check. I'll bite. Mining companies are like biopharma companies. They are virtually worthless until they strike it rich, either with FDA approval or a proven mine. Right now, this company has a history of good mines, but nothing going forward that is solid. It is all potential, hence the decrease in price. It would be like if a pharma company sold their patents to fund a new product, but that product has only just now entered FDA review. Rarely do those companies come out of FDA review/trials with success the first time, and often taking multiple trials. The same applies here. There is the possibility of success with these newer mines, but nothing is certain. It is a ton of risk, like quite high, but on the chance they make it, it will have an equally high reward. Mining companies seem like moneyholes to me Sir, this company couldn’t even turn a profit after gold went through the roof…

You should go all in. 

/s In case you thought this was financial advice. Im going to be honest dude

If youre going to invest in the mining sector do it in rare earth related ones like UAMY and NB

Look at the massive push the federal government is doing for rare earth production and mining and how many grants companies like this are getting

During the entire trump administration THIS is the mining sector to invest in - not random gold mining companies that are full of risk. Sold yesterday at 10 percent loss Gold price last two years: nearly doubles.

GORO price last two years: cut in half.

BTC holdings: 1,484 BTC – a company record

Hashrate: 6.57 EH/s globally, with a ~1 EH/s North America expansion ongoing

Company buybacks active, showing management believes shares are undervalued

They stopped with their AI Chips business to focus entirely on mining and profitability

And one thing to keep in mine, there were big insider purchases in June:

CEO Nangeng Zhang and CFO James Jin Cheng purchased a combined 817,268 shares

Avg. price: ~$0.76/share → over $620,000 invested out of pocket

5 reasons of why it's worth taking a look 🧐

1. Insiders are buying


2. Production is growing


3. Company holds BTC as a reserve asset, which could appreciate significantly


4. Actively buying back shares, which reduces dilution and suggests undervaluation


5. Focusing purely on mining and efficiency, shutting down less profitable segments of their business 

6. Today (08/07) they anounced the date of Q2 results:

Canaan Inc. Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call

""The Company's management team will hold a conference call at 8:00 A.M. on August 14, 2025, U.S. Eastern Time (8:00 P.M. on the same day, Singapore Time) to discuss the financial results. Details for the conference call are as follows:

1mk0ke5,2025-08-07,"PSTV Shareholders Approve Key Changes In Today's Shareholders Meeting. Get Ready for What’s Next!

Hello again everyone, you had to assume I was going to be giving a fresh update and some DD after the shareholders meeting this morning.. so let's get to it and clear the air real quick...

PSTV just voted YES to a 1 for 25 reverse split. ( thin, NON Panic ratio).. and some people might see that and immediately think it’s bad. But this is not one of those panic moves you see from dying companies. This is a thin, controlled split that sets the stage for what’s coming next.

This is not some sketchy 1 for 100 desperation move. A 1:25 split is one of the cleaner ratios you’ll see. No red flags here!!!  This isn’t about trying to stay alive  this is about tightening up before what is going to be a massive run.

This move isn’t random.. they planned this.  they’re tightening the float because catalysts are lined up. Here’s the proof:

1. FDA Greenlighted Their New Brain Cancer Treatment!!
The FDA just cleared REYOBIQ for pediatric brain tumors. That’s not speculation... that’s OFFICIAL!! They’re entering clinical trials on a market with no other good options.


2. They Just Secured $1.6M in Non-Dilutive Funding
That came straight from CPRIT (Cancer Prevention & Research Institute of Texas). It’s free money, not another dilution trap.


3. CNSide Platform Is Already Rolling Out Commercially
This isn’t a “future maybe” pipeline. they’ve already started deploying CNSide now in Texas to detect cancer through spinal fluid. That’s real-world utility, not a PowerPoint pitch.


4. Conference Presentation Coming Aug 14–16
They’ll be presenting live at the SNO/ASCO CNS Metastases Conference. one of the biggest in their field... has sent other companies in the same field FLYING. . Expect attention.



So yeah, if you’re holding..don’t flinch... AND DONT DUMP .. This split is just a clean up job to get the house in order before they step up onto a bigger stage. The fundamentals haven’t changed. NOTHING HAS CHANGED.. that's why we got the THINNIST RATIO for the R/S!!! In fact, they’re only getting stronger!!! 

If you believed in PSTV last week, there’s even more reason to believe now. DO NOT PANIC SELL.

We’re holding through this. Let the dust settle and watch what happens next. EVERYTHING IS OKAY



Edit: Ratio was changed to 1:25
[deleted] Keep holding ladies and gentlemen agreed its still got some growth coming but we really need to ignore OP over-hyping so much - he's almost hurting the stock more than helping I see, 1:2 RS to keep listing status, always a strong sign lol a bit sus indeed, i will keep holding because of the upcoming catalysts Thank you for the update!

1mjfa22,2025-08-06,"XRTAF is Growing Too Fast (DD)
Tl;dr:

* Xtract One ($xtraf) has been growing at 100%+ for 4 years
* Has order backlog to continue growing at 100%
* Cash flow problem from growing too fast + temporary tariff setback
* Growth stock is temporarily cheap

Here are the charts for two competing companies. They are both making AI systems to replace metal detectors in stadiums, schools and hospitals. 

The older incumbent:

https://preview.redd.it/z4tikk5ugghf1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1a78c2452d9511a5ae1fcf04e4a48e6e0a878cd

And the newer competitor:

https://preview.redd.it/7nqyoosvgghf1.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb450d826b7f83088d39febf8afe9f2dcc282b03

Xtract One has been growing faster than Evolv and recently came out with a better product, but they’re down 53% on the year while Evolv is up 126%. Hence this DD. 

**Evolv (the bigger incumbent)**

Two machine setup, one machine for people and one for bags.

https://preview.redd.it/tyob5onzgghf1.png?width=360&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d658989214321dd2ecc743bfd686abdf8ad5c45

This takes more space and is slower to process. Their setup requires 300 lb of machinery to process 1900 people per hour (source: [DHS Sept 2024 SAVER report](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-09/24_0924_st_weaponsscreeningmsr_1.pdf)):

https://preview.redd.it/uipj5go4hghf1.png?width=1352&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cb60072a552bf08670da1c136e11a99df36f3c5

Accuracy isn’t perfect. Evolv was sued by the FTC in the last twelve months for failing to detect weapons while incorrectly flagging items like water bottles, three ring binders and laptops.

Financially, Evolv is losing money but is growing at a 57% rate with a 58% margin. Market Cap/Sales is an expensive 10.0.

**Xtract One**

Lesser known company but seems to have the better product. Only requires one machine:

https://preview.redd.it/6vkeryg8hghf1.png?width=956&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ea999145b755aa9a071566a139a509c5a391eff

Customers don’t have to take off their bags, they can just walk through. This is convenient, and also lets people flow through 25% faster:

https://preview.redd.it/ykdh953ahghf1.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=fafff04e29e06e605455c503e3e13dfa37b4b794

It’s also only 40 lb compared to Evolv’s 300 lb double machine set up, so it’s portable and easy to set up between events. [Pricing is about 40% lower](https://stadiumtechreport.com/feature/security-scanners-market-report-who-are-the-providers-in-the-stadium-security-scanner-marketplace) than Evolv. 

Financially, they’re smaller but growing faster, at a 105% annualized growth rate:

https://preview.redd.it/gh5tlzkbhghf1.png?width=1888&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c84c450c9d51d499fd2d8dbfed1108a3f02aebc

Margins are 57% and expected to grow higher. 

**Xtract One Gateway**

They came out with a new product in July:

https://preview.redd.it/arjoj0zehghf1.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&s=4373de3c06ba709e5bff112c9e796c78170c1681

This has better accuracy and can identify the bottles, laptops and other metal items that the FTC sued Evolv for not detecting. 

Most importantly, this new product is getting them deals from Fortune 100 companies. 

**Revenue to multiply, again?**

I’m convinced they’re crushing it:

“our business model has shifted quite significantly from smaller companies and deals to much larger organizations, particularly Fortune 100-type organizations…**average deal size is growing significantly, almost threefold**.”

Revenue could multiply if they can ship fast enough: they did $16M revenue in the last twelve months. Order backlog is $36.5M. $100M of qualified sales pipeline, of which $40M is at late stages.

Margins are high (57%) and expected to grow next year. Unit costs are going down as production scales up.

They’re doing security at Madison Square Garden and the Las Vegas Sphere and are starting to land more blue chip names. 

Disney deal coming? “a global customer, a large global media and entertainment organization… potential for expansion over time across the brand's portfolio of hundreds of entertainment venues, retail stores and production facilities worldwide…feedback from the customer who had tested other solutions has been outstanding.”

Cirque Du Soleil? “\[Xtract One\] was chosen by a leading, global performing arts company, known for permanent and touring live entertainment”

A deal was announced this quarter with an MLB team, the Colorado Rockies.

“for every customer announcement we make there's obviously many, many more dozens that have not been made publicly”, since their customers “do not announce security technologies”.

Traffic to their website is also up (Semrush):

https://preview.redd.it/1kxynqpihghf1.png?width=1686&format=png&auto=webp&s=172b2fe5d4f85c4e6a1d259e7fd1f42de20f3a34

**Why is the stock down?**

Cash Flow! This is a tale as old as time. Rapidly growing company runs into a cash flow problem as soon as it starts working with Fortune 100 companies. They have to pay upfront to develop and manufacture their new expensive product.

Ouch:

https://preview.redd.it/sgdwa7vlhghf1.png?width=1374&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d701bc94fb48eb6c62443339aaedd9e948893c1

They’re used to working with small schools and hospitals which pay quickly. Fortune 100 companies have long sales cycles, and then you often get paid 90+ days after you finally deliver the product. Xtract One is new to working with large companies and got wrecked, they ran out of cash manufacturing their new product:

https://preview.redd.it/j73yn7bkhghf1.png?width=1418&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1384654ccf74a178472808a3c7fefb454e3ebf1

Notes from the quarterly transcript.

Fortune 100 deals are slow:

“First, the mix of our business and our business model has shifted quite significantly from smaller companies and deals to much larger organizations, particularly Fortune 100-type organizations. Accordingly, these larger organizations tend to invest a lot more time in the analysis, the budgeting, the security design, the con ops and the flow of their overall business mapping out that whole process and often request pilots that last from 30 to 90 days, where previously we might have seen pilots lasting for a day. In the short run, this has delayed bookings and pushes out revenues.”

Then they got hit by tariffs:

“there was a noticeable pause with some of our customers as they evaluate the impact of the business from the rapidly changing U.S. economic policies”

And their customers paused their sales cycle to reevaluate their new product:

“And lastly, we experienced some shifts from an interest in the SmartGateway to our new Xtract One gateway with some customers resetting their pilots”

And they switched from upfront sales to a subscription model, pushing revenue further back. 

**Cost of not managing Cash Flow**

Anyways, the story I’m hearing is this is a great company with a best in class product, that ran out of cash because it was growing too fast and then its customers paused deals due to tariffs. Good company that got caught off guard, and the cost was share dilution. They had to sell 18M shares at $0.39 CAD, raising $7M. They also had to throw in warrants to sell another 18M shares at an exercise price of $0.49.

Ouch. Embarrassing.

Anyways, um, they have plenty of cash now:

“We believe Q4 cash flow will be greatly improved. And in fact, we currently have more cash today than we did at quarter end. Accordingly, we feel comfortable in current cash levels to carry us through our next phase of growth.”

**Risks**

1. Cash flow. They just ran out of cash and had to dilute shares. I’m willing to forgive it because I think the cause is the business *is too good and is growing too fast*, but like ouch. They just raised $8.1M CAD so hopefully this isn’t a problem they run into again.
2. Competition. They seem to have the best product at the moment, but Evolv and other competitors are also iterating. At the moment though it seems the customer demand is plenty big for both of them.

**Why I’m buying**

It looks to me like Xtract One has a better product than the incumbent, Evolv, but it’s only priced at 1/20th the market cap. It’s priced at 3.7x sales, which is less than Evolv’s 10x. They’ve been growing at 100%+ for four years and their sales backlog points to hyper growth continuing.

Their big issue was growing too fast and running out of cash. Growing too fast is a problem I’m willing to forgive. Management says they’re comfortable with cash levels now, and while I’m not as confident as they are, I’m willing to take the risk. 

Also, the subscription model change and delays due to tariffs and switching to Fortune 100 companies is making their growth story look weaker than it is:

https://preview.redd.it/9jg49ec4ighf1.png?width=1710&format=png&auto=webp&s=46a7d7252cacb7af3362500761905e2f2236826c

Management is saying their growth is basically exploding still, and these numbers should show up in the back half of the year. Given this is a thinly traded OTC Canadian stock that nobody is talking about, I’m betting the market just isn’t giving them proper credit for their growth story yet, but they’ll figure it out in a quarter or two. 

Anyways, I’m in for $175k @ $0.25 USD

https://preview.redd.it/bpxh3culighf1.png?width=1999&format=png&auto=webp&s=35bca64c090a7245a4489f72045f7d9ce2a1aff5

They have a competitive product as well and arguably more well suited to thrive in the market here. Evolve is mostly hype as you correctly identified. 

I'm invested in liberty but I like what you shared so think I'll jump in! Thanks! Wild fucking ride Thanks man.

1mjdwg7,2025-08-06,"Ascent Solar Technologies Provides Corporate Update Detailing Customer Pipeline and Sales Progress in Space and Aerospace Industries
News Link - https://share.google/pa0uEFH1SsCGoyQEP

THORNTON, Colo., Aug. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ascent Solar Technologies, (Nasdaq: ASTI) (“Ascent'' or the “Company”), the leading U.S. innovator in the design and manufacture of featherweight, flexible, and durable CIGS thin-film photovoltaic (PV) solutions, today published a corporate update detailing its customer and sales progress, as well as its strategy to meet growth opportunities in the aerospace and space industries.

The full report can be found here, projecting 2026 sales to reach $5 million to $20 million, and 2027 sales to achieve $25 million to $40 million.

It does not reflect sales currently under contract.

The report also outlines the Company’s competitive advantages and details its customer acquisition strategies within its respective market focuses of aerospace and space. It follows a number of significant milestones achieved by Ascent in the last two years, including its space solar modules flying on NASA’s LISA-T Mission; signing a Collaborative Agreement with NASA to advance the development of its thin-film PV power beaming capabilities; establishing a Master Services Agreement with NOVI; signing several teaming agreements and MOUs with various organizations in the space and defense industries; and providing test product samples to several other companies for potential adoption.

“We are very proud of the technological and commercial progress achieved since our corporate restructuring in 2023. In that short time our company has made remarkable efficiency improvements to our technology and processes, established an unrivaled ability to fulfill orders in just a few days, and connected with numerous potential customers interested in testing our technology. All of this and more is reflected in our confidence in issuing this report,” said Paul Warley, CEO of Ascent Solar Technologies. “We are laser-focused on improving efficiency and engaging a wide range of companies that represent a broad customer base, with a focus on providing technology that meets the burgeoning need for durable, reliable solar solutions in space.”

1mjbtg9,2025-08-06,"CPSH an undercover company executing while having a large pipeline.
# So what does CPSH do?

They are a metal matrix composite company or MMC for short. They supply base plates and housings to semiconductors. What does this actually mean? They basically provide housings for semiconductors to improve thermals. This is especially valuable in EVS, hybrid EVS and wind turbines. In October 2024 they secured a 13.3 million dollar contract for a 12 month span which means it should last through 2025.

They basically had a turnaround year where their financials have significantly improved. In their last two quarters they returned to profitability. Although the market has rewarded this improvement, I think there is significant upside to the company. For reference the company is profitable and generated 8 million in revenue this quarter. This was a company high and a 60% improvement from last year. There products are starting to really catch on, this is most likely due to tailwinds in industry with more uses for their ALSIC and Hermetic Packaging solutions. The CEO has also hinted that margins will increase and demand will be continuing through the year.

So what do we have?  
a company with 30 million revenue on the conservative side for this year and that's profitable and with a pipeline for the future. How many companies do you know that are US based, with 40 million market cap doing this? 

The company has a couple of moonshots. They have their MMC business which is there core business, and then they have the a bunch of SBIR contracts which hopefully turn into huge contracts. Their last huge contract was for their hybridTech armor for 28.7 million with the navy (this resulted in the stock hitting 25$ for a day). With the navy making their budget larger I have hopes that they will have another contract similar to the one they had before. Obviously this would lead to a huge run up.

ALMAX is the most promising of the SBIR, they are the sole provider of this reinforced aluminum and just won a sbir contract with the army to improve amphibious vehicles and also had their first commercial order. This is really promising because its showing signs of another one of their products catching on.   
CPSH at this stage doesn't have much downside. Revenue is starting to stabilize and margins as well. Now is really just a waiting game for their 7 SBIR contracts to turn into something larger than what they are now. Even if only 1 of the SBIR contracts turn into larger ones the price should double.

Insider buying,   
there has been some insider buying so that's a good thing around 27k shares.

I have a position in this company and this is NFA

1mj5kwv,2025-08-06,"2025 Antimony Bull Market: Why Military Metals Corp ($MILIF | MILI.C) Is Front and Center
# 2025 Antimony Bull Market: Why Military Metals Corp ($MILIF | MILI.C) Is Front and Center

# Why Is Antimony Suddenly So Important?

Antimony is no longer a niche industrial commodity—it's now a linchpin in North America and Europe’s strategic materials push. Its role is essential in:

* **Ammunition and defense applications** (armor-piercing bullets, explosives, missile components)
* **Electronics and semiconductors** (flame retardants in circuit boards, batteries for grid-scale and military)
* **Energy storage and renewables** (antimony is key to next-generation batteries and energy storage systems)
* **Specialty alloys and catalysts**, vital for everything from advanced manufacturing to green transition tech

Over 70% of the world’s supply still comes from China, but 2024–2025 saw China severely restrict exports, pushing prices in Europe to highs last seen decades ago—over $59,000/tonne. Meanwhile, Western defense and tech suppliers are warning of “months, not years” before inventories run dry.

# Military Metals Corp ($MILIF | MILI.C): The Only Pure-Play Leveraged to Three Western Antimony Corridors

# Unique Global Footprint—No Other Junior Has It

**Military Metals Corp stands out for one simple reason:**  
It is **the only Western junior explorer and developer with large, advanced, and high-grade antimony assets in three of the world’s safest, most procurement-friendly jurisdictions**:

* **Europe (Slovakia/Trojárová)**
* **Canada (Nova Scotia/West Gore)**
* **United States (Nevada/Last Chance)**

**That means:** Whether U.S., Canadian, or EU buyers need antimony, $MILIF | MILI.C can meet their critical procurement needs—while also enjoying reduced geopolitical/political risk thanks to a diversified project pipeline.

# 1. Trojárová (Slovakia): Massive, Secure, Untapped Antimony Reserve

**Why it’s a Big Deal:**

* **Historic Estimate:** 2.46 million tonnes @ 2.47% Sb (\~61,000 tonnes contained antimony) plus gold byproduct credits.
* **Current Value:** Over $3 billion in-ground at spot prices.
* **Few equivalent Western assets:** Trojárová is among the largest undeveloped antimony deposits under NATO/EU control.
* **Technical Progress:** Underground LiDAR and modeling work ongoing, with major resource update pending (using SLR Consulting).
* **Strategic Leverage:** As the EU and NATO ramp up critical minerals procurement, this project could become a foundational supplier for Western defense and battery supply chains.

**What’s Next:**  
Watch for new resource models, advanced drill targeting, government engagement, and development study kick-offs. These are all potentially company-making events in a bull market.

# 2. West Gore (Nova Scotia): Near-Term Cash Flow From High-Grade Stockpiles

**Why it’s a Big Deal:**

* **Rare Near-Term Monetization:**
   * Historic stockpiles averaging nearly 18% Sb (up to 40%), with a gold kicker. Grades like these are almost unheard of today, especially in material that can be processed or sold rapidly.
   * Current estimates suggest over $30 million USD in antimony recoverable from stockpiles alone.
* **De-risked Entry:**
   * Stockpiles offer MILIF/MILI.C a way to start generating revenue long before new mines are built, rare for any junior explorer.
   * These can potentially be sent straight to North American refiners like UAMY, monetizing the resource immediately and building crucial relationships with domestic offtakers.
* **Exploration Upside:**
   * Magnetic drone surveys have outlined three new, promising high-priority targets in surrounding ground for future drilling—potentially growing the resource base even further.

**What’s Next:**  
Expect updates on processing, offtake deals, expanded drilling, and possibly even stockpile movement/early revenue—making cash generation and value crystallization real, not just theoretical.

# 3. Last Chance (Nevada): 100% U.S.-Controlled and Pentagon-Relevant

**Why it’s a Big Deal:**

* **Location is Everything:**
   * The U.S. Pentagon has declared antimony a “critical mineral.” U.S.-sourced, U.S.-controlled antimony is now a top defense priority.
   * Last Chance is 100%-owned by MILIF/MILI.C, sitting within a major U.S. mining jurisdiction.
* **High-Grade Potential:**
   * Surface rock-chip samples up to 11.6% Sb across a 1+ km trend.
   * Ongoing permitting for maiden drilling, with recent land expansion and aggressive targeting.
* **Strategic Upside:**
   * Could qualify for Pentagon strategic minerals support or direct procurement.
   * Fits perfectly into the narrative of “secure U.S. supply, for the U.S. military and industry.”

**What’s Next:**  
Keep an eye out for permits, drilling results, and potentially state/federal support for critical minerals development.

# Macro Catalysts for MILIF/MILI.C and Antimony

# 1. China’s Export Clampdown and Price Explosion

* Western buyers are increasingly locked out of Chinese supply. Prices have increased \~1,000% since 2020.
* European, US, and Canadian defense contractors have actively warned about imminent shortages.

# 2. NATO, EU, and Pentagon Are Aggressively Funding/Procuring Domestic/Allied Critical Minerals

* Massive new funding and procurement mandates across North America and Europe create huge tailwinds for credible Western antimony projects.
* MILIF/MILI.C’s footprint and asset stage uniquely qualify it for support and strategic relationships.

# 3. Western Stockpiles Are Critically Low—Immediate Demand Spike

* Key western buyers now have just “months, not years” of material left in inventory, putting a premium on near-term assets (like Canadian stockpiles) and credible new supply.

# The Investment Case: Why MILIF | MILI.C Is An Asymmetric Bull Market Play

* **Triple-jurisdiction, advanced-stage projects in ALL the right places**—literally the only Western junior to offer this level of Western procurement leverage.
* **Near-term revenue from Canadian stockpiles** (a huge edge as most juniors rely on years-long development).
* **Massive blue-sky upside** from Slovakia if unlocking a European-scale deposit during government procurement rush.
* **Real US-sourced antimony advances with Nevada progress**—vital as the Pentagon pulls domestic supply chains closer to home.
* **Multiple, near-term catalysts:** New resource estimates, permitted drilling, government grants/support, off-take deal announcements, and actual revenue from processing/stockpile movement.
* **Potential to partner, toll, or deliver feed to existing North American refiners like UAMY** while retaining project optionality.

# Why The Market Cares Now

The era of cheap, abundant antimony is over for the West. National security concerns, energy transition, and the digital economy are all converging to make antimony a high-profile, high-value, and politically protected mineral.

In this context, **Military Metals Corp ($MILIF | MILI.C) is the single most leveraged, catalyst-rich, and diversified Western play**.  
It’s not only a “story stock” for headlines but a near-term cash-flow generator and a scale-up pipeline for the world’s next big antimony supplier—precisely as policy, money, and investor attention flood into the sector.

**In summary:**  
If you are looking for a junior mining company that could anchor the Western antimony supply renaissance—delivering real assets, genuine jurisdictional diversity, immediate revenue, and maximum leverage to both price and policy—**$MILIF | MILI.C is it.**  
The next year will likely bring news-flow that could move MILIF from a niche explorer to a strategic cornerstone for Western defense, tech, and industry supply chains.

According to this latest 10 Q MagnaChip has made the transition into power semiconductors. you can see that their only losses are from the display segment of their business.
As they stated in the previous quarters, they are now going to be a profitable company. Although the revenue is lower, their net profit is higher and in the green.

1miuafj,2025-08-06,"Newron Pharmaceuticals Evenamide- The future Gold Standard in treatment-resistant schizophrenia
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-025-02188-y

Abstract
Schizophrenia is characterized by positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms. However, current D2-based antipsychotic drugs only address primarily positive symptoms. Limbic hippocampus hyperexcitability is a key pathological state of schizophrenia, representing an ideal therapeutic target. Evenamide is a selective voltage-gated sodium channel blocker that reduces neuronal hyperexcitability. We examined the effect of acute evenamide treatment on the hyperdopaminergic state, hippocampal hyperexcitability, social deficits, and recognition memory in the methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) neurodevelopmental model. Male and female Sprague-Dawley offspring from dams treated with saline or MAM on gestational day 17 were tested as adults (postnatal day >65). Electrophysiological recordings were made in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and ventral hippocampus (vHipp) and social approach and novel object recognition were tested. Evenamide (3 mg/kg i.p.) normalized the number of spontaneously active DA neurons in the VTA of female and male MAM rats and reduced pyramidal neuron hyperactivity in the vHipp. The hyperdopaminergic state in the VTA of female and male MAM rats was also rescued by local evenamide injection in the vHipp (1 µM). Systemic evenamide also reversed the recognition memory impairment of female and male MAM rats. For social deficits, only male MAM rats exhibit a reduced social sniffing time that was normalized by evenamide. These findings suggest that evenamide’s efficacy in downregulating the hyperdopaminergic state, social deficits, and recognition memory impairment may result from its ability to attenuate vHipp hyperexcitability. 

Therefore, evenamide could offer a novel therapeutic strategy that is capable of addressing positive, cognitive, and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.

1mig2rs,2025-08-05,"$CPSH: Why Isn't This Low-Float Microcap Moving? Stellar Financials, Big Contracts, and Huge Potential!
Fellow investors, I'm puzzled why $CPSH isn't seeing more volume or price action. This low-float microcap has no dilution, strong fundamentals, and massive growth potential. Here's the breakdown—tell me what I'm missing!

**Recent Financials (Q2 2025):**

* **Earnings:** $0.01 per share, a **114.29% improvement** from last year's $(0.07) loss.
* **Revenue:** $8.079M, up **60.62%** from $5.030M last year. One of their best quarters ever!

**Why CPSH Stands Out:**

1. **Major Tech Partnerships:** Long-term contracts with giants like $MSFT, $IBM, $HP, and $DELL.
2. **Aerospace & Defense Contracts:** Key deals with $LMT (Lockheed Martin), $RTX (Raytheon), and $CR (Crane). Their last big contract sent the stock to \~$30!
3. **Semiconductor Exposure:** Supplies Infineon, a top European semiconductor firm that powers $NVTS and $NVDA.
4. **Revolutionary Material:** Their composite matrix is a game-changer for tech, aerospace, defense, drones, ships, cars, solar/wind, and nuclear applications. Orders are rolling in, with growing interest.
5. **U.S. Navy Contracts:** Recently finalized a major deal with the Navy, their biggest customer. Another contract is expected soon, backed by newly funded naval budgets. Plus, SBRs with the DoD.
6. **Strong Ownership:** Heavy institutional backing from BlackRock, Vanguard, and others, plus recent insider buying signaling confidence.

**The Question:** With a tight float, no dilution, booming financials, and high-profile contracts, why isn’t CPSH spiking? Is it under the radar, or am I missing a red flag?
Looks good it's 8.02M Rev n debt cash =3.2M it's already trading at fair MC=42M X 5 Rev. It's a good entry point @ 1.80. I dont.see any obstacles after the Rev except forward guidance or any backlog? I personally love CPSH. Been holding for a while now. Thanks for the write up.

1midkva,2025-08-05,"Plus Therapeutics Inc, $PSTV (and another one when you reach the end)
I came across this company recently, on news that they launched a new product: diagnostic on brain cancer:

1. CNSide : it runs a diagnostic on the patient to detect Brain cancer WITHOUT surgery, they have implemented it in Texas so far.

2. they have a drug (REYOBIQ) that targets incurable brain cancer
3. August 14-16 PSTV is going to present at the SNO/ASCO CNS Metastases Conference, where the whole world will see what they’re doing, how they are doing it and what they have achieved (this conference has sent similar bio stocks up).

Personally I’m holding a position in this stock. I also have BTAI (sold half when it doubled and leaving the rest for August 20th catalyst DYOR, trust me it’s worth some DD for an 85% chance FDA approval. This drug is used to treat agitation in dementia and bipolar affected people. Will present phase 3 trial results on the 20th this month.

$PSTV
$BTAI
I'm all in on PSTV! LETS GO!!! 🤑🎉🥂 Pstv entry price: 0.72 haven’t exited yet
Btai entry price: 1.4
Btai sold half @3.05 keeping second half for phase 3 results 🤞🏻 For some reason its going down Average daily volume creeping up 🫣 Anyone know what is driving pstv down right now? I know lots of people are concerned.... just sit back and relax. Everything is fine ...  and if you got in before the hype train..we are still in the green and having upward momentum. NOTHING HAS CHANGED.. the hype train started... and ended.. now there's a dip while it finds its footing again to it's true value .. there is no negative news.. the company didn't take a hit .. they are actually over 40 million in volume and in the green from their perspective. They are doing great still ...to us it looks like it started their run.. and got dumped or is crashing. But the trend line is normal. We aren't losing. Some portfolios are in the red on PSTV because most people bought in at like 80 cents give or take.. we just gotta let it find its footing until the 14th. We are OKAY.. everyone needs to RELAX.

And there is NOT a reverse split happening..The 7th is their annual shareholders meeting.. where there are PROPOSING several topics. Including reauthorizing an R/S. But there is not a vote happening on an R/S.. 

It's already being put in hospitals in Texas.. they are doing this silently ofc. Because they are dropping EVERYTHING at this conference... Their Earnings report is also on the 14th.. they are sharing their progress with the CNSide rollout, the success of CNSide platform.. and the success of their clinical trials for their drug REYOBIQ.. and remember.. any R/S is at their discretion.. so when and IF They vote on an R/S again.. they have 12 months to implement it after the vote. 


Everyone needs to take a breath.. and realize we are the ones who caused it to surge.. and now it's finding its footing after the hype train. We are still moving fine.. the company is doing great 👍🏼 $1.6 or $1.7 is my target price. $3 would be beautiful but I think $1.7 is more realistic It’s holding where it is currently. Good time to buy or sell Early stage micro-cap biotech = volatility. Promising results but at a small scale. Next potential catalyst is SNO/ASCO conf mid-August - results presentation of Respect-LM clinical trials - see Nasdaq article link below.

**$MILIF (Military Metals Corp): In-Depth Breakdown as 2025’s Top Antimony Play**

# Company Overview

Military Metals Corp (MILIF) is emerging as the standout junior mining company in the antimony sector, uniquely positioned with advanced assets in three key Western regions: Europe (Slovakia), Canada (Nova Scotia), and the United States (Nevada). Amid escalating geopolitical tensions and China’s chokehold on antimony exports, MILIF’s diversified footprint puts it squarely in the sights of Western governments and defense supply chains scrambling for secure, friendly antimony sources.

# 🇪🇺 Trojárová, Slovakia (Flagship Asset)

* Resource Size: Historical estimate of 2.46Mt grading 2.47% Sb (\~61,000 tonnes of antimony).
* In-Ground Value: Over $3B at current spot prices ($50,000–$59,800/t).
* Byproduct Credit: Also contains a gold byproduct of \~0.635g/t Au.
* Development Status: Underground LiDAR surveys underway, new resource model with SLR Consulting in progress.
* Strategic Relevance: One of the most significant undeveloped antimony resources in a NATO-aligned nation; critical for potential EU/US/NATO procurement.
* Future Milestones: Upcoming updated resource estimate, advanced drill targeting, and initiation of development studies.

# 🇨🇦 West Gore, Nova Scotia

* Stockpile Characteristics: Historic stockpiles sampled up to 40.6% Sb and 106.5g/t Au; assays average 17.9% Sb.
* Potential Value: Est. $30M worth of contained antimony accessible in legacy stockpiles alone.
* Exploration Status: Drone magnetic surveys have identified three new high-priority target zones for further drilling.
* Short-Term Monetization: Legacy stockpiles present unique near-term, low-barrier cash flow opportunity not often available to juniors.
* Future Milestones: Further stockpile processing, resource expansion through new zone drilling.

# 🇺🇸 Last Chance, Nevada

* Geology: Multiple showings over a 1km trend with surface samples up to 11.6% Sb.
* Ownership: 100% owned by MILIF, positioning it as a true U.S.-controlled critical mineral asset.
* Permitting & Development: Actively working on permits for maiden drill campaign.
* Strategic Upside: Solidifies MILIF’s eligibility as a U.S. domestic supply candidate—vital as the Pentagon prioritizes American antimony.

# Jurisdictional and Strategic Advantages

* Triple-Jurisdiction Model: MILIF is the only known junior with meaningful exposure in all three Western zones, offering significant flexibility as NATO, the EU, and the U.S. ramp up procurement from non-Chinese sources.
* De-Risking Through Diversity: Political, permitting, and off-take risks are diffused by the asset spread across stable, mining-friendly Western countries.
* First-Mover Advantage: As supply shock drives prices and Western strategic stockpiling, being first to develop in multiple safe jurisdictions compounds MILIF’s optionality and leverage.

# Current Catalysts and Macro Factors

* Development Catalysts:
   * Multiple resource/modeling milestones due.
   * New target discoveries at all projects.
   * Permitting advancement and possible near-term stockpile processing revenue.
* Antimony Market Tailwinds:
   * Prices hit $59,800/t+ in Europe after China’s export clampdown.
   * Western defense manufacturing now facing real supply shortages.
   * Active moves by Pentagon, NATO, and EU to fund friendly supply routes.
* Investor Asymmetric Opportunity:
   * Major upside from any of the “big three” assets achieving permitting, resource upgrades, or initial offtake agreements.
   * Early-stage status and microcap market valuation make MILIF the most leveraged to Western antimony reindustrialization.

# Investment Summary

$MILIF is uniquely positioned for potentially explosive upside because:

* It controls advanced, high-grade antimony projects in all three “priority procurement” Western regions.
* It offers near-term cash flow from Canadian stockpiles, massive resource leverage in Slovakia, and future development in the U.S.
* Its diversified portfolio, multiple paths to de-risking, and readiness for any geopolitical procurement wave set it apart during a global scramble for non-Chinese antimony supply.

If a Western antimony supply race truly accelerates in 2025, the scale, jurisdictional breadth, and upcoming project catalysts could make $MILIF the sector’s single most asymmetric play.

# Other Major Antimony Stocks for 2025

* $XTPT (Xtra Energy Corp.):
   * Focused explorer with >22 surface stockpiles averaging 12.8% Sb (up to 33%), potential early revenue from stockpile sales, and aggressive drill programs underway across Nevada and expanding land in Washington.
   * Multiple catalysts: ongoing drilling, stockpile monetization, and favorable U.S. policy environment.
* $UAMY (United States Antimony Corp.):
   * Established U.S. producer and refiner, offers reliable North American supply.
   * Lower risk and slower growth; supply/demand premium may already be priced in after recent media-fueled share activity.
* $PPTA (Perpetua Resources):

Best setup in the space, hands down. Real assets in NATO countries, near-term cash flow, and barely anyone's watching. CEO interview of Military Metals: [https://youtu.be/Wk2E7AZokK0?si=yZjizFKoAizzSTIw](https://youtu.be/Wk2E7AZokK0?si=yZjizFKoAizzSTIw) That Slovakia asset alone is wild Antimony is just heating up! Gonna be a fun rally All in on MILF r/criticalminingstocks

UAMY is the best Antimony play. They have proven mineral resources, they have the only 2 smelters in North America.  

They are shipping and processing antimony and have Department of Defense contracts. 1% the market cap of PPTA and 3/4 the Antimony 

60k tonnes vs. 80k tonnes; on the Slovakian asset alone! Its an explorer company, mines take 10-20 years to come online. usually a major will purchase something like this, then take into production once the assets have been proven to their liking.

1mi8wzn,2025-08-05,"$GAMB – Profitable, 85% locked float
Let me tell you about $GAMB – Gambling.com Group.

A profitable, cash-generating business expanding fast across the US and Europe.
Insiders own over 40%. Institutions own 45%+ (BlackRock, Vanguard, Susquehanna, Millennium, etc.).

That’s over 85% of the float locked up.
Only ~1.1M shares shorted, and daily volume is just 200k–400k.
It would take very little to trigger a sharp move.

Management said it loud and clear: they’re aiming for $100M EBITDA by 2026/2027.
Q1 2025 was already $41M revenue with strong recurring income and rising margins.
B2B segment (OddsJam + OpticOdds) is growing like crazy.

And yet… it’s stuck at $10. Why?

✅ Institutions aren’t selling
✅ Insiders aren’t selling
✅ Retail hasn’t noticed (yet)
✅ Accumulation is quiet and steady

Looks like someone is keeping this suppressed before the big move.
Q2 earnings drop August 14. If they crush it again, it could pop hard.

This is a low-float sleeper with real fundamentals.
Dirt-cheap valuation.
Zero hype. Zero meme. Real growth.
Once it breaks out, good luck catching it under $15.

DYOR but this one feels like a no-brainer.
Just needs attention. And a spark.
The float is tight. The fuse is lit. 🔥

Besides the fact that this post was terrible and written by ai (calls on nvdia & google) why has it fallen so much recently? As far as I can tell this website is just a domain squatter (more or less) with links to other gambling websites?  What else do they do?

^(if) ^(you) ^(have) ^(any) ^(questions) ^(or) ^(concerns.) There was no reason given for downside by the original poster. Bad sign GAMB Sentiment and Options Analysis

Stock Performance and Analyst Sentiment

GAMB’s stock has seen some pressure recently, down nearly 13% in the past month and over 28% year-to-date. However, it's still up 10% over the past year, rebounding from its 52-week low. Analyst sentiment is very positive: the current consensus is a Buy, with all recent analysts recommending buying and no hold or sell ratings. The average target price is $19.50, nearly double the current price, pointing to significant potential upside.

Recent News and Fundamental Drivers

Recent headlines highlight a mix of short-term struggles and long-term optimism. The stock dropped 16% in the last four weeks, but this may have pushed it into oversold territory, suggesting that selling pressure could be easing. Fundamentally, GAMB is seeing strong growth—subscription revenues jumped 400% in the past quarter, and management is considering share buybacks at these discounted levels, showing confidence in the business.

Options Flow Sentiment

Options flow for GAMB over the past three days (with a focus on significant trades over $25,000) shows no noteworthy activity. This lack of large options trades suggests that big players and institutions are largely on the sidelines in the options market right now. That could indicate a wait-and-see approach, with sentiment from options traders currently neutral due to limited volume and participation.

Summary

Equity sentiment: Bullish from analysts, neutral-to-cautiously optimistic from news and fundamentals.
Options sentiment: Currently neutral; no large, directional bets are evident in the recent flow.
Retail traders will want to watch for increased options activity as a sign of shifting sentiment, but fundamentals and analyst views remain strong for GAMB in the medium term. I bought a few shares. I’ll check it out a little more tonight That’s the old misconception,  but it’s completely outdated.
Yes, it started as a pure SEO affiliate model, but that’s no longer the full picture.

They’ve built a full-stack performance marketing machine + now own premium assets like RotoWire, Casinos.com, OddsJam, and OpticOdds. They’re not just redirecting traffic, they create original betting tools, advanced odds comparison infrastructure, and subscription-based B2B products that sportsbooks pay for.

They’re moving from pure affiliate to data-driven monetization including high-margin recurring revenue. So no, it’s not just a ‘blog’ or domain squatter anymore. It’s one of the most profitable businesses per employee in the industry.

1mhhnyw,2025-08-04,"Undervalued. Underrated. Unstoppable. PSTV Could 15x This Month! This Tiny Stock Just Changed Cancer Treatment Forever
Alright, here is ANOTHER DD for $PSTV, since we have seen AMAZING movement since last Wednesday. I spent a HUGE chunk of my morning getting all of this info and cleaned up the clutter so please listen up. And I hope you enjoy my DD!

 Every now and then, a tiny biotech stock sneaks under the radar before blowing the hell up. Think of it like getting in on a tech startup before they drop the app that changes the game. That’s where PSTV is sitting right now. And here’s the kicker...this one isn’t just hype. It’s already in motion!!!

The Setup:

PSTV is trading under at around .60 cents today. That’s penny stock territory. But they aren’t some BS shell company waiting on a miracle. PSTV is already making waves with a platform that could revolutionize how we treat brain cancer. We’re talking real-world use, not fantasy science.

The Catalyst That Changes Everything:
In LESS THAN 14 DAYS they are going commercial with CNSide, a first-of-its-kind liquid biopsy platform that detects brain tumors using spinal fluid.. no surgery required!!! Read that again.

Let that sink in. A non-invasive diagnostic method for brain cancer. That's never been done before. That alone puts them in a league of their own.

BUT WAIT, THERES MORE!

Within the same month, they’re presenting their clinical results for drug REYOBIQ!! a drug that targets and kills the two deadliest forms of brain cancer: glioblastoma and leptomeningeal metastases. They have had OVERWHELMING success according to sources. Also a world first!!

This Month is Critical And getting in ASAP is priority and Here's Why:

August 14-16: PSTV presents at the SNO/ASCO CNS Metastases Conference, where the world will get a look at what they’re doing. This conference has sent similar biotech stocks FLYING.

This is not a waiting game. The company is moving NOW. They’ve already received multiple designations from the FDA, including Orphan Drug and Fast Track. Including over 18 million dollars in government grants and the backing/support of world renown cancer institutes, colleges, doctors, and scientists.


Why This Could Make You Rich FAST?? 

Market cap is tiny: under $20M. One solid press release or clinical success, and this thing WILL explode.

They’re not diluting. and voting against reverse splits! They're focused. And they’ve got a legit science team backing everything up.

Price Target: Analysts and sentiment on social media are pointing toward $3–$4 in the short term, and $10+  long term! The highest bull price target is $32!!! Which honestly isn’t off the table as data and commercialization unfold.


If You Missed Out On:

NVAX before COVID

MRNA before it went viral

BNGO before genomics became hot


Then PSTV is your Second chance. 

I really hope my DD did some justice to PSTV. Where do y'all stand? Anyone else hopped on the train already? And if not.. what's stopping you? 

Edit: 🚨WE ARE IN OUR PRE-BREAKOUT DIP!🚨 This was expected, we rode the hype train for a day or 2 there so a dip was bound to happen on that alone. The data is still REAL and the Catalysts are still LIVE.. nothing has changed.. no negative news.. nothing. So buy more in this dip because  everything will be OKAY!  it's all still green hills I promise y'all. Just sit back and TRY to enjoy the ride. Have some faith and follow the Data. 
Bought 13k shares at 0.69. Going to sell at 4.20.

Lost 15k on ixhl last week but I've got a really good feeling on this one! I like the stock, am buying more, and see another few multiples in its future, but let's not run away with ourselves. Fundamentally, this is an effective niche diagnostic tool for a rare illness and a very effective drug for treating the same rare illness. Emphasis on *niche* (likely not insurer-friendly) and *rare* (small market cap). $3-4 is reasonable; $10-$32 is currently a pipe dream. You’re going to get rug pulled just like most of these ‘plays’ I learned from IXHL to take profits and not be swayed by the dreams/pumping of social media...i should have taken profit at 1.50 instead of getting all starry eyed and indoctrinated with 'oh it'll hit $2/3/234478892409!!!11!' 

I'll probably hop on this for a little bit but actually set a 7% stop loss this time instead of extended bag holding. you’re either a bot, stupid or going to get wrecked/rug pulled or all 3. 

this post reads like a classic low‑float biotech hype post  all catalyst talk, no substance. PSTV is a microcap with no revenue, burning cash, and 100% dependent on early‑stage trial success. The “game‑changing” language and moon targets are exactly what you see in pump‑and‑dump setups. Conference presentations ≠ FDA approval, and retail hype won’t change the fact this thing can tank 50% overnight. Treat it like a lotto ticket if you must, but don’t mistake this for a fundamentally solid long‑term hold.

have fun Expect a pop to $3-$4 by the end of the month. Probably by the 17th tbh. And highest price target I've seen so far is $32 but most of them sit in the $10-$15 range. We are up 20% today I'm sure you had a really good feeling on IXHL as well ... I think a rug pull is possible tbf. I have 10,000 shares and I’m in for $1, but we need to remember IXHL Stop loss didn't save me from IXHL because it took a nose dive right at close that time.

1mhgiir,2025-08-04,"WSJ Article today and my Top Antimony Stocks for 2025: $MILIF and Key U.S. Peers
**Top Antimony Stocks for 2025: $MILIF and Key U.S. Peers**

**Why $MILIF (Military Metals Corp) Is the Standout Pick**

* **Unmatched Jurisdictional Reach:** Only junior with exposure in all three major Western regions—Europe (Slovakia), Canada (Nova Scotia), and the U.S. (Nevada)—positioning it as a unique potential supplier for Western defense and industry.
* **Large, High-Value Resource:** Trojárová project (Slovakia) boasts a historical 61,000t Sb resource—over $3B in current in-ground value at spot prices, with a gold byproduct as an added bonus.
* **Immediate Monetization Potential:** West Gore (Canada) stockpiles average 17.9% Sb, worth an estimated $30M, with some samples as high as 40.6% Sb and 106.5g/t Au—offering both scale and grade for near-term catalysts.
* **U.S. Supply Leverage:** Last Chance (Nevada) provides multiple antimony showings (up to 11.6% Sb) and is fully owned, making $MILIF a true domestic supply candidate.
* **Multiple Development Catalysts:** Ongoing resource modeling, geophysics, new target zones, and permitting activity across all three regions.
* **Macro Tailwinds:** China’s export restrictions have triggered a scramble in the West for secure antimony supply, pushing prices above $59,800/ton and spotlighting juniors with real assets.
* **Asymmetric Upside:** As an early-stage junior with major resource and near-term milestones, $MILIF offers high risk but also the most significant upside as the West re-industrializes antimony supply chains.

**Other Major Antimony Plays**

* **$XTPT (Xtra Energy Corp.)**
   * **U.S.-focused, Nevada-based explorer** with over 22 surface stockpiles averaging 12.8% Sb (up to 33%), early monetization opportunities, and an active drill program underway.
   * Expanded land holdings in strategic U.S. antimony belts (Nevada and Washington).
   * Multiple near-term catalysts: phase 1 drilling, stockpile sales, land expansion, and strong Pentagon alignment as the U.S. seeks domestic sources.
* **$UAMY (United States Antimony Corp)**
   * **U.S.-based producer and refiner** with established infrastructure—providing reliable North American supply.
   * Lower risk profile and slower growth, but steady performance as demand for domestically refined antimony rises.
   * Much of the supply “premium” may already be priced in by recent share activity, so upside is likely more modest.
* **$PPTA (Perpetua Resources)**
   * **Pre-production mega-deposit (Stibnite, Idaho) with Department of Defense backing.**
   * One of the largest U.S. antimony reserves, but still in pre-production—requiring significant capital and time.
   * Strategic long-term holding for those who want exposure to secure, large-scale U.S. reserves, but near-term upside is limited.

In this landscape, for me **$MILIF** earns the top spot for its unique global portfolio, multi-stage catalysts, and the ability to address Western strategic supply vulnerabilities. **$XTPT** is a pure U.S. explorer with active drilling and near-term stockpile monetization potential. **$UAMY** offers lower risk as a current U.S. producer, and **$PPTA** is a long-haul play tied to the largest U.S. deposit with government backing—but with a slower route to material returns.

1mh8feb,2025-08-04,"Spectral AI ($MDAI): 95.3% accurate gov-backed AI, FDA submission confirmed, earnings imminent, still under $2.50. This is what asymmetric setups look like before they break out.
Spectral AI ($MDAI) is, quite literally, what institutions wait for and what retail always sees first. A government-funded AI device with breakthrough-level clinical accuracy. A non-invasive wound diagnostics platform proven in trials, preparing for commercial deployment, and now officially submitted to the FDA. Yet still trading at a market cap of just \~$54 million. No analyst coverage. No real volume. And now, with Q2 earnings less than two weeks away, the setup is cleaner than ever.

The core product, DeepView®, is an AI imaging system that identifies the depth of surgical burns with 95.3% accuracy, confirmed in a multicenter trial completed in May–June 2025. For comparison: trained surgeons average 40.8%. DeepView also improved detection of non-healing wounds from 61% to 89%, all without ever touching the patient. This isn’t theory. It’s clinically proven. And the U.S. Department of Defense has already awarded Spectral a contract to support its integration in battlefield and trauma care settings. That matters. Real funding. Real interest. Real-world stakes.

Spectral has received over $130 million in non-dilutive government support, holds FDA Breakthrough Device Designation, and filed its De Novo submission on June 30th, 2025. That submission marks the shift from speculation to execution. From “potential” to “pipeline.” And it opens the door to institutional screens, analyst models, and serious capital.

What makes this even more extraordinary is that Spectral AI currently has no direct competitors. There is no other company with a fully developed, FDA-submitted, AI-driven solution for non-invasive wound diagnostics. If approved, Spectral will hold a first-mover monopoly in a $14.6 billion global wound care market. That’s not narrative - that’s math. A single-player advantage in a multi-billion dollar market is almost unheard of at this valuation level. And the market still hasn’t noticed. 

The timing couldn’t be better. Q2 earnings drop on August 12th after market close. Last quarter, Spectral posted its first profitable result, beating expectations with $6.7 million in revenue and $2.9 million in net income. If this quarter confirms that trajectory, the narrative shifts fast. Profitability plus FDA momentum is the one-two punch most small-cap medtech investors dream of - and it’s happening now, in real time, at sub-$60M valuation. 

Most sub-$3 stocks are early, unproven, and unfunded. Spectral is none of those things. It’s past the preclinical stage. Past the funding gap. Past the technology risk. The product works. The trials are done. The government is involved. And the FDA review has officially begun. But the price still reflects a company that hasn’t even started.

With 40 million fully diluted shares, a $1 billion valuation would put the stock at $25. That’s not a stretch. That’s a rational estimate based on FDA approval and modest commercial adoption. If DeepView becomes standard-of-care in trauma, burns, or diabetic ulcers - even in a fraction of the market it addresses - the upside becomes hard to model. That’s what a monopoly in a $14.6B space looks like before the market wakes up.

And here’s what most people are missing. MDAI shareholders are expected to receive shares in SMIP, Spectral’s IP-focused spin-off, which is preparing for a separate Nasdaq IPO later this quarter. SMIP holds and manages the underlying patents behind DeepView, and high-profile investors , including Donald Trump Jr. ,  already have a stake. It’s rare to see a microcap medtech company deliver this kind of optionality on top of real clinical traction. Yet here we are.

**Bottom line: Spectral AI is far past the point where the market should still be ignoring it. FDA submission is in. Contracts are active. Clinical data is in the books. Earnings are imminent. And the spin-off is coming. But because there’s no coverage, and no hype, it’s still flying under every radar that matters. That won’t last.**
OP: how about posting stuff like that during lows (april - mai 2025). I'm not interested in getting into this at the top without any margin of safety 😂 Could chat GPT write up. But here's what ChatGPT says.

The screenshots you’ve shared paint a very bullish picture of Spectral AI ($MDAI) — but the tone and structure read more like a promotional pitch than an objective analysis, so I’d be careful before making decisions. Here’s my breakdown:

The Bullish Case (as presented)

Technology & Accuracy

DeepView® AI imaging claims 95.3% accuracy in identifying surgical burn depth, significantly higher than trained surgeons.

Non-invasive, no patient contact, proven in multicenter trials.

Already used in military/trauma contexts with U.S. DoD interest.

Government & FDA Position

Over $130M in non-dilutive government funding.

Holds FDA Breakthrough Device Designation and has filed a De Novo submission (June 30, 2025).

Contract with the U.S. Department of Defense for battlefield/trauma integration.

Financial & Market Potential

Q2 earnings due August 12th (less than two weeks away).

Last quarter was their first profitable quarter ($6.7M revenue / $2.9M net).

Market cap only ~$54–60M with claims of a $14.6B total addressable market.

No current direct competitors.

Extra Catalyst

Possible spin-off (SMIP) with separate Nasdaq IPO. Shareholders may receive spin-off shares.

The author frames this as a ""first-mover monopoly"" situation.

The Risks & Red Flags

Source & Tone

This post is clearly written to hype. The language is promotional (“this won’t last,” “monopoly,” “door to serious capital”). That’s typical of penny stock forums and can be a sign of someone talking their own book.

No mention of risks like FDA delays, competition, or cash burn rates.

Regulatory Uncertainty

FDA submission ≠ approval. The process can take months or even years. A delay or rejection could tank the stock.

Commercialization Risk

Even with great trial results, adoption in healthcare is slow. Hospitals, burn centers, and military procurement have long sales cycles.

Market size estimates ($14.6B) may be overly optimistic — not every wound care setting will adopt immediately.

Microcap Volatility

~$54M market cap means extreme price swings on relatively small volume.

If insiders, institutions, or hype traders dump shares, price could collapse quickly.

Spin-off Hype

Spin-offs can be good, but they can also be overhyped to boost the parent company’s stock short term.

Little detail is given about SMIP’s actual revenue, market readiness, or financials.

Balanced View

Potential Upside: If the FDA approves DeepView and adoption happens even modestly, the stock could move sharply higher from current levels.

Real Risks: Approval isn’t guaranteed, commercialization will take time, and hype-driven buying could reverse violently.

Investment Type: This is a speculative microcap biotech/medtech play — not a safe, steady investment. You’d only allocate money you’re willing to lose entirely.

If you want, I can dig up current analyst sentiment, institutional ownership, and recent SEC filings for $MDAI so you’ll have a more grounded, less Reddit-hyped picture before deciding.

Do you want me to do that next? Here is what I think

* Their debt is about 70% of their Total Cash
* Analysts' average is \~ $5 (that's currently a 2.1x bagger)
* Insider purchases are strong (14k shares purchased to 0 sold)
* [Their TAM is $2-$3B (burns niche)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1mh8feb/comment/n6ufhlb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), which is still very attractive since they don't seem to have competitors in their niche

\- They've just sent their device to the FDA, a possible approval will only work as a **catalyst between 12/2025 to Q1 2026**.

I would have probably scooped a few shares for shits and giggles when they PPS was around $1.20. We are currently at $2.36, which is [historically almost higher than it has ever been](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MDAI/) (if you don't count two pump spikes).

The PPS needs to come down in order for me to increase Margin of Safety. Check this out , there's a total of 8 videos , Answers everything from Finances, to FDA Approval , Army handheld device , etc . from A-Z 

[interview with Spectral AI's Chairman of the Board, Dr. J. Michael DiMaio](https://youtu.be/cGktsfcfYSM)

[MDAI : Finances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6RdtHfjs98&t=94s)

[Spectral AI's DeepView FDA Submission Process](https://youtu.be/25nbD9FZIjs)

And from what I understand MDAI shareholders will get free shares of the new IPO SMIP (Spectral IP) of which Trump Jr. is on the board. For better or worse lol , you be the judge Entering now might be a bit scary, I've been buying shares over past 6 months. I'm pretty confident that they will get approval without problems but it can take anywhere from few months to couple years. I work in a regulatory/quality team for a medical device supplier in Europe and I'm not that sure about the FDA timelines.

  
But ye I at least recommend adding this to your watchlist I also wondered, this is what the almighty GPT says:

# 🧠 1. TAM – Total Addressable Market

**Global wound care market**:

* Estimated at **$23B+** in 2024 and projected to grow to **$30B+** by 2030.
* Covers all types: **burns, diabetic foot ulcers (DFU), pressure ulcers, surgical wounds**, etc.
* Of that, **AI-based wound assessment and imaging** is a **fast-growing subsegment**.



📌 **TAM for Spectral AI**:  
👉 **$2B–3B** (focused on **AI-driven diagnostics** for burns and DFUs globally)

# 🎯 2. SAM – Serviceable Available Market

This narrows down to:

* **Burn and DFU diagnostics**, not wound dressings or general wound care.
* Markets with clinical infrastructure or funding (e.g., U.S., Europe, military/defense).

Spectral AI’s own investor materials indicate a **$1.7B SAM** opportunity:

* \~$600M in burn triage (civilian + military)
* \~$1.1B in DFU diagnostics

📌 **SAM for Spectral AI**:  
👉 **$1.7B–2B**, across U.S., military, EU, and select allied health systems

# 🧩 3. SOM – Serviceable Obtainable Market

**If Spectral AI captures just:**

* 5–10% of its SAM in 3–5 years = **$85M–$170M/year**
* Possible upside from U.S. military contracts, BARDA (already awarded), and potential foreign defense agencies

📌 **SOM (conservative projection)**:  
👉 **$85M–$170M annual revenue potential** within 5 years Ive seen this stock around for some time so u might think youre too late but your not. Its early and look at the potential market. I’m in the process of doing an analysis will probably post tomorrow, but I am very bullish on the FDA clearance. If it doesn’t clear than RIP but it’s looking incredible favorable with the added bonus of the new administration pushing fancy tech for healthcare and military operations.

IPO will be priced coming days. It's a carve-out IPO, and $BTBT owns 80%.

Bit Digital's (NASDAQ: $BTBT) AI infrastructure subsidiary WhiteFiber announced its initial public offering (IPO) on July 29, 2025, with the goal of listing 7.8 million shares under the "" $WYFI "" name on the Nasdaq at $15–$17 per share. 
This move, supported by its rapid growth from 1 to over 20 customers since early 2024, could unlock value for $BTBT shareholders through a spinoff that separates its AI segment.

1mh3i7l,2025-08-04,"$WATT: Energous is actually doing something
So $WATT has been pushing hard into this “Ambient IoT” thing. Basically battery‑free tags that get powered by RF, wifi, whatever, so you dont gotta swap batteries every few months

The one I'm ontomistic about is Battery free e‑Sense tags.  Launched June ‘25. 4x5cm waterproof tags, track temp + location in realtime, no battery. No current competition for this especially with dual temp sensors.

Full platform – PowerBridge (wireless power transmitters), e‑Sense tags (the sensors), e‑Compass (cloud software). Can scale to millions of tags in a warehouse.

Use case – Cuts battery maintance, constant tracking (better than just RFID pings).

Big names – Part of Ambient IoT Alliance w/ Qualcomm, Intel, PepsiCo, Wiliot, etc, I can only imagine the applications but for now warehouse and logistics kinda make sense.

Numbers – Q2 2025: record rev, smaller losses, backlog growing. I used chatgp to make a graph of their capex and income to show the direction. Don't judge me.


Why it matters: Ambient IoT is starting to get rolled out for real. $WATT now has a full system in market. If this sector takes off, they’re already in position. 

Not financial advice, DYOR. 
Full transparency, I added 100k at $0.4 after seeing the trend in revenue.

	•	Commercial launch of fuel-cell units expected within months
	•	Pilot programs reportedly underway in marine and public sanitation fleets
	•	Ongoing discussions with municipalities and logistics operators for retrofitting use cases
	•	Management actively pursuing industrial partnership to accelerate commercialization
	•	Potential eligibility for France2030 or EU clean-tech grants
	•	Legacy MoU with Crédit Agricole (10K hydrogen vehicles) may be restructured
	•	Exploring use of compact stacks in aerospace and hydrogen drones


Why It Matters Now

Hopium is currently priced as if it has no viable future. Yet the company:
	•	Has working technology in an expanding sector
	•	Has removed short-term debt risk
	•	Has financing in place and cost controls implemented
	•	Has early-stage commercial traction underway
	•	Has one of the lowest valuations among hydrogen tech companies globally

With a float compressed post-split and sentiment still flat, any material update—be it a customer agreement, a public subsidy, or a strategic JV—could lead to a sharp repricing.

Conclusion

Hopium offers a compelling case for investors seeking deep-value, high-risk/high-reward exposure to hydrogen infrastructure. The setup—clean structure, operational runway, validated IP, and multiple unpriced catalysts—makes it a microcap worth watching closely.

This is not financial advice. The risk is high, as with all early-stage deep-tech equities. But the asymmetry in valuation and optionality may appeal to investors focused on special situations and disruptive energy themes.
We can only hope that this company will make us any money. Good name Hopium, that shows your hope in this asset.

1mfj38r,2025-08-02,"Iterum therapeutics $.73 ready for $10 🚀 commercialization of Orlynvah, REASSURE, Corey Fishman
**** 🚨WATCH $ITRM MONDAY MOVEMENT! Tuesday 8:30a.m. premarket earnings call****
**research CEO Corey Fishmans
Upcoming Event: Q2 2025 Earnings
	•	Iterum will report its second-quarter 2025 financial results on Tuesday, August 5, 2025, before the U.S. market opens.
	•	A conference call is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. ET, with domestic/international access codes provided and a webcast available post-event via the company’s investor site  ￼.

👤 New Commercial Lead
	•	Effective June 30, 2025, Christine Coyne was appointed as Chief Commercial Officer, tasked with leading the U.S. launch of ORLYNVAH™ and broader commercial strategy  ￼.
	•	On July 1, she received a stock option grant enabling purchase of 200,000 ordinary shares at an exercise price of $0.97/share under Nasdaq inducement rules  ￼.

🧪 Clinical Trial Results Published
	•	On June 25, 2025, results from the REASSURE Phase 3 trial were published in NEJM Evidence, showing oral sulopenem (ORLYNVAH™) was non‑inferior and statistically superior to Augmentin in treating uncomplicated UTIs in adult women.
	•	About 9.2% of participants had pathogens resistant to three or more antibiotic classes; overall treatment success was 61.7% vs. 55.0% with Augmentin  ￼.

🚀 Commercialization Partnership
	•	Iterum has partnered with EVERSANA Life Science Services to handle U.S. commercialization for ORLYNVAH™, targeting a market launch by Q4 2025. EVERSANA will manage sales operations, marketing, regulatory, logistics, and medical affairs  ￼.

💬 FDA Approval & Regulatory Extension
	•	The FDA approved ORLYNVAH™ (oral sulopenem) on October 25, 2024 for treating uncomplicated UTIs in adult women with limited oral treatment options. The launch is slated for mid‑2025  

🚀 Iterum is building momentum: FDA-approved ORLYNVAH™, promising Phase 3 data published, leadership team assembled, commercialization partnership in place, and a Q2 earnings call scheduled to discuss next steps. The company appears poised for U.S. launch in late 2025 and is working to extend its financial flexibility into 2026 and beyond.

👨‍🏫
Why Some Physicians May Prefer ORLYNVAH

1.	⁠Resistance Landscape •	ORLYNVAH is the first oral penem approved in the U.S., targeting resistant pathogens like ESBL- or AmpC-producing organisms that are unaffected by amoxicillin-based therapies  ￼. •	In SURE‑1, ORLYNVAH outperformed ciprofloxacin in fluoroquinolone-resistant infections (62.6% vs. 36.0%)—though in ciprofloxacin-susceptible cases, it was non‑inferior but not superior  ￼.
2.	⁠Oral Option vs. IV Therapies •	For patients with multidrug-resistant pathogens who otherwise would need IV antibiotics, ORLYNVAH offers a home-based oral alternative, helping reduce hospitalization and complexity of care  ￼ ￼.

Here’s a clearer look at Corey N. Fishman, CEO of Iterum, and his track record with prior companies:

🧠 Career Highlights

Durata Therapeutics (2010–2015) •	Served as CFO and COO, overseeing finance, operations, strategy, business development, international operations, and portfolio oversight. •	Raised over $225 million through a successful IPO and follow-on offering. •	Led Durata’s sale to Actavis plc in 2014 for approximately $675M in equity value. ￼ ￼

Meda/MedPointe (2002–2008) •	Became CFO in 2006 at MedPointe (private equity-backed), leading finance, strategy, debt restructuring, portfolio optimization, and multiple line extensions. •	Oversaw the company’s eventual sale to Meda AB. ￼

Ganic Pharmaceuticals (2008–2010) •	CFO at this Warburg Pincus-backed company (details limited); served as an earlier stepping stone in his pharmaceutical finance career. ￼ ￼

📌 Board Roles Illustrating Influence •	Momenta Pharmaceuticals: Appointed to the board in 2016. Momenta was later acquired by Johnson & Johnson in late 2020. ￼ •	BioSpecifics Technologies: Joined the board in 2020, prior to its eventual acquisition by Endo International plc.

Company Role Key Outcome Durata Therapeutics CFO / COO Raised significant capital; sold to Actavis for ~$675M MedPointe / Meda CFO Led strategic turnaround and successful M&A exit Board Roles Momenta & BioSpecifics Both companies acquired by large pharma players Iterum Therapeutics Founder & CEO Secured FDA approval for ORLYNVAH™ and preparing for commercial launch

✅ Bottom Line

Corey Fishman’s track record is strong: from capital raises and successful IPOs to orchestrating M&A exits in the specialty pharma space. He has repeatedly navigated companies from financing stages through exits or acquisitions. Now at Iterum, he is executing a similar playbook—achieving FDA approval and gearing up for commercialization.

• voting on 9 proposals during September 10th shareholders meeting. 
•extremely profitable and marketable product for investing companies interested 
•  the entire team is already successful, with reputable references,
• already completed & foreseen multiple (5-6) different companies,  drug approvals, multiple successful launches & sales to major pharmaceutical companies . 
•The sheer amount of women patients orlynvah will treat more comfortably & effectively. Considering it’s the ONLY one ☝️ of its kind with FDA approval in the United States. I believe doctors/investors are already anticipating  the release of orlynvah, given the increased amount of untreated UTIs, and ineffectiveness of augmentin.



“You are cordially invited to the 2025 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of Iterum Therapeutics plc, an Irish public limited company (the “Company”) to be held at 25 North Wall Quay, Dublin 1, D01 H104, Ireland on September 10, 2025 at 3.00 p.m., Irish time (10.00 a.m., Eastern Time).

8.receive and consider the Company’s Irish Statutory Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 and the reports of the directors and auditors thereon, and review the affairs of the Company; and

9. consider any other business properly brought before the 2025 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders or any adjournment or postponement thereof.
Our board of directors unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” Proposal Nos. 1 through 7 as set forth in the proxy statement.
We hope that you will participate in the meeting by voting through acceptable means as described in this proxy statement as promptly as possible. Your vote is important – so please exercise your right. 
 
Sincerely, Corey N. Fishman”

August 5th, 2025
🚨 🚨 
Iterum Therapeutics is preparing for a significant milestone with the upcoming launch of ORLYNVAH™, the first FDA-approved oral penem antibiotic in the U.S. and first branded treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTIs) in over 25 years. This launch, expected in AUGUST 2025, addresses a critical medical need as antimicrobial resistance has rendered many generic treatments ineffective.

The company has established key commercial infrastructure through its partnership with EVERSANA for U.S. commercialization services and secured manufacturing through ACS Dobfar. These partnerships, along with hiring a Chief Commercial Officer, position Iterum for its commercial transition.

They’ve announced TODAY that their new medicine orlynvah will launch THIS month. Which is actually ahead of schedule. Extremely transparent 

✅ Positive
✅ First branded antibiotic for uUTIs in 25+ years launching August 2025
✅ Strategic partnership with EVERSANA for U.S. 
✅ commercialization secured
Manufacturing agreement with ACS Dobfar S.p.A 
✅ established
Canadian patent protection extended until 2039
✅ Pfizer debt repayment extended to October 2029
Cash runway extended into 2026


🚨 Negative
Net loss increased to $6.5M in Q2 2025 from $5.0M in Q2 2024
General and administrative expenses more than doubled to $4.2M from $1.9M YoY
Limited cash position of $13.0M requiring additional ATM offering

Who else is ALREADY holding a bag?
I hate these chatGPT low effort posts. 4. Create an additional 80,000,000 shares

No thanks No you didn’t. My welcome? phase 3 results in june and why this stock barely move after(and prior) to the release. Nah ah. So they only have outstanding shares totaling 42.6 million then they are adding 80 million shares 

At fridays closing price, that equates to a new price of 0.254 if they issued all at once, which I don't think will happen, but in the end, that's the math Bold of you to assume i can read. $9,000 for 1 dose.  No one will choose this over other UTI treatments This stood out to me also. Along with a couple of other proposals that followed after #4

On the surface, I agree this new product as amazing potential, but my concern is when will it be safe to get in and avoid the inevitable fall in stock price once all 80 million shares have been

1meaidc,2025-07-31,"Why I’m Watching $BEEM — A Deep Dive into a Small-Cap EV/ESS Play with Asymmetric Upside
Hey everyone, long-time opportunity investor here. I’m a career scientist in the U.S. government research sphere, so I live and breathe technology road-mapping. On the investing side, I flagged PLTR in late-2020 (sub-$10) and NVDA before its 2023 AI melt-up both calls well documented in my post history. That mix of deep-tech insight and hands-on government procurement experience is exactly why Beam Global ($BEEM) grabbed my attention.


1. What They Do

Beam Global makes off-grid solar EV charging and energy storage solutions. Their flagship EV ARC™ stations are portable, self-powered chargers that can be dropped into a parking lot without any trenching, utility permitting, or demand charges.

Mission: Enable clean mobility and resilient energy infrastructure.

Edge: They live in a niche between big on-grid players (ChargePoint, ABB) and the coming EV infrastructure boom — off-grid means fast deployment and no grid upgrade delays.

Optionality: Their battery division (via AllCell) gives them exposure to telecom, micro-grid, and defense energy storage markets.


2. Leadership Matters

CEO Desmond Wheatley has been with Beam since 2010, CEO since 2011.

He’s navigated multiple uplists, acquisitions, and non-dilutive financing rounds — exactly what you want in a micro-cap growth story.

Insider ownership is 13.3%, which is meaningful for a company this size. Alignment is there.


3. Financial Snapshot (FY-2024 / TTM)

Revenue: $49.3M (down YoY from $67M, but still 2× 2022 levels)

Gross Margin: 15% GAAP / 21% adj. (vs 2% last year — massive improvement)

Cash Burn: $2.2M from ops, down 80% YoY

Balance Sheet: $4.6M cash, zero debt, and a $100M untapped credit line

Valuation: ~$36M market cap → 0.84× TTM sales vs peers at 3–5×


Beam’s quarter-to-quarter numbers are lumpy (government contracts), but the trend toward positive cash flow and gross margin expansion is real.


4. Why I Like It

Here’s my investment thesis in plain English:

Asymmetric upside: Sub-1× sales for a clean-tech hardware company with IP and 60% 5Y CAGR is rare.

Clear path to profitability: Margins jumped from 2% to 15% GAAP in one year — scaling ops are working.

Policy tailwinds: IRA, NEVI, EU Fit-for-55 — everything is screaming for solar+storage and grid-resilient charging.

Unique niche: “Plug-and-play” off-grid chargers solve the #1 EV adoption headache: infrastructure bottlenecks.

Diversification beyond EVs: Energy storage and micro-grids could unlock entirely new revenue streams.

Just exanded to Middle East With New Abu Dhabi Venture for EV and Energy Tech

21% ESS Revenue Growth reported last week.

Just signed $2M order and signed 3 new clients including fortune 500 company.

Analyst consensus PT is ~$17 (≈7× current price). Even partial execution gets you a 2–3× scenario in 2–3 years.


5. Key Risks

Revenue volatility: Federal/municipal contracts can make quarters look feast-or-famine.

Small-cap swings: $36M market cap, beta 2.2 — not for weak hands.

Execution risk: Scaling to $200M+ revenue will test supply chain and working capital.

Policy dependency: A shift in government incentives could slow orders.

6. TL;DR

I see Beam Global ($BEEM) as a speculative but fundamentally de-risked small cap sitting right in front of a macro tailwind. They have no debt, growing margins, a differentiated product, and exposure to two secular trends: EV infrastructure and distributed energy storage.

Not financial advice — but I like buying companies before Wall Street cares. This is one of those “get paid for being early” setups if management executes.

Position :10,000 shares @2.32.

1me6y50,2025-07-31,"$FNM - First Nordic Metals just closed a C$15.4M LIFE financing
I've been watching First Nordic Metals (FNM) and just saw they **closed a $15.4 million raise** at **$0.37 per unit**. Its LIFE financing so theres no hold period which is always nice. 

The stock has been **drifting down a bit over the last few months** so this financing at a relatively low price might be pretty smart. 

I’m paying attention because:

* Theyre focused on Sweden and Finland two stable and resource-rich regions that are still underexplored in terms of critical minerals. Frasier institute just ranked theze countries 1st and 6th ([https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/2025-07/annual-survey-of-mining-companies-2024.pdf](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/2025-07/annual-survey-of-mining-companies-2024.pdf))
* The oversubscription suggests institutional players see upside potential.
* It’s still trading around the financing level so it could be an interesting entry if you believe in the exploration thesis. My view is very long term

Obviously it’s still earlystage and theres execution risk like with any explorer. But with this cash in the bank they have some breathing room to put out real results.

Was always fascinated bout Nordic stories, maybe im biased because we don't have that many interesting mining companies to go around in Europe.

1me2i69,2025-07-31,"GORO : Gold Resource Corporation Reports H1 2025 Drilling Results and Operational Improvements at the Don David Gold Mine
DENVER--([BUSINESS WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com/))--**Gold Resource Corporation (NYSE American: GORO)** (“we,” “us,” “our” or the “**Company**”) is pleased to report highlights to date from its 2025 underground drilling campaign and provide an operational update from the Company’s Don David Gold Mine (“DDGM”) in Oaxaca, Mexico.

**Highlights**

* Drill results from the new Three Sisters Vein System continue to return consistent results that indicate good width and grades that indicate potentially higher Net Smelter Return^(1) values (“NSR”).
* The Company has engaged Cominvi Servicios S.A. de C.V an experienced underground mining contractor, with the benefit of their new mining equipment, to accelerate the development and access into the higher grade Three Sisters vein systems. Since May, more than 1,350 meters of development, including ramps and drifts, have been completed.
* The Company has begun using cut-and-fill mining methods in select areas of the mine to reduce dilution and increase the run of mine average grade and returns.
* A third dry stack filter press has been ordered for the processing plant to increase throughput and returns.
* Orders are in for good used equipment to replace some of our own older underground fleet. This will reduce maintenance costs and improve our productivity.
* The process plant is under a full review to the goal to further optimize reagent use and increase recoveries and payable metals. Initial trials already indicate the potential for promising returns.

**2025 DRILLING SUMMARY**

During the first half of 2025, the underground diamond drill program focused on ore definition and grade-control within the Three Sisters vein system, as well as in select veins of the Arista system. Significant vein widths and grades were encountered and reinforce the potential for the Three Sisters and Gloria vein systems to be a third major mineralized vein system strategically located between and north of the Arista and Switchback systems.

“Consistent high-grade drill intercepts, along with an improved understanding of the geology, have allowed us to build more confidence in the mine plan of the Three Sisters system and reinforcing its role as a key contributor to future mine production,” stated Allen Palmiere, President and CEO of the Company. “In addition, we are excited about the potential benefits from bringing in an experienced mining contractor along with their new equipment, while changing out some of our old fleet with good used equipment to improve our efficiencies and returns. We remain focused on integrating the Three Sisters system into our short-term mine plan while continuing to advance exploration efforts aimed at driving sustainable growth and maximizing shareholder value.”

The drill result highlights presented in this press release further demonstrate the growing potential of these vein systems. The Company believes the mine has significant potential to generate positive cash flow from the newly defined Three Sisters and Gloria vein systems, as well as from additional zones recently identified near existing mining areas in both the Arista and Switchback systems. The Three Sisters and Gloria vein systems are easier to access, located near the current mine portal and at significantly higher elevations than those of other production areas and will result in reduced haulage distances and costs. To support access and continued definition of these areas, targeted investment in underground development and equipment has been initiated, including the engagement of a contract miner in Q2 2025 and the sourcing of lightly used underground mining equipment.

**2025 Drill Results and Program:** Through the first half of 2025, a total of 51 underground definition and ore-control drill holes, totaling 6,615 meters of diamond drilling, have been completed at DDGM. The program continues to deliver high-grade intercepts that confirm the continuity and quality of the mineralization. These results have further defined the geologic model for the Three Sisters and Gloria vein systems, while also upgrading mineral resources within select veins of the Arista system. The Company plans to initiate additional exploration development in the second half of 2025 to support further infill and expansion drilling, particularly to the northwest of the currently defined extents of the Three Sisters – Gloria zone.

Selected grade-control drill results from the first half of 2025 at the Three Sisters vein system are presented below. Intercepts are reported as Estimated True Widths^(2) (“ETW”) and include Gold Equivalent^(3) grades (“AuEq”) and NSR.

1mdwwqy,2025-07-31,"How Graphene Could Revolutionize Artificial Intelligence
I was convinced early on about graphene’s future as a wonder material. But it wasn’t until Dr. Sorensen exploded onto the scene (pun intended)

with his discovery that the scalability, and consistency of graphene production could be achieved.



Now with so many uses being discovered everyday for graphene AI is about to supercharge its uses. I came across this article and sums up so many things about how graphene will change the world.



Unfortunately its author was not provided in the article in March 2024.

Artificial intelligence is on a tear, transforming industries and reshaping our world. But behind the scenes, a tiny, one-atom-thick material could be the key to unlocking even more powerful AI: graphene.

For decades, silicon has faithfully served as the workhorse of the tech world. But as AI algorithms become more complex, silicon chips are starting to strain under the immense processing power required. Enter graphene, a marvel of material science with properties that could leave silicon in the dust.

Imagine an information highway for electrons. Silicon is a bumpy, congested road, while graphene is a smooth, six-lane superhighway. Electrons in graphene zip along at much faster speeds, translating to AI systems that can crunch data and learn exponentially quicker. This translates to real-world benefits: faster medical diagnoses, more efficient self-driving cars, and even a potential leap forward in natural language processing, bringing us closer to truly human-like AI interactions, even surpassing the capabilities of current models like ChatGPT and Google Gemini.

But graphene’s brilliance doesn’t stop there. Unlike silicon, graphene is an excellent conductor of heat. This means AI systems built on graphene chips wouldn’t overheat, a major bottleneck for current silicon-based systems. Imagine cramming more processing power into a smaller space without worrying about meltdowns – that’s the kind of design flexibility graphene offers. This increased processing power could significantly enhance the capabilities of an AI applications like an AI image generator and AI video generator, enabling them to create even more realistic and sophisticated content.

The road to a graphene revolution isn’t without its bumps. Mass production of high-quality graphene remains a challenge. But researchers are making significant strides. Recent breakthroughs, like the creation of the first functional graphene processor, demonstrate the immense potential.

The stakes are high. The first company to crack the graphene code for AI could establish a dominant position in the race towards next-generation computing. Investors are taking notice, pouring funds into research and development. The race is on, and the winner could redefine the future of AI.



So, the next time you hear about a mind-blowing AI feat, remember the invisible hero behind the scenes – graphene. It’s a revolution waiting to happen, and it could change the face of AI forever.
Hydrograph clean power (HGRAF). I've listened to hours about this company and I like what I've heard. The CEO, Kirstin Bruere, sounds very competent and aware of future challenges. The inventor, Dr. Chris Sorensen, goes into fine detail of what makes graphene applications so massive for it's potential. Kerry Landis is a nuclear engineer that is invested in hydrograph and he covers the potential for nuclear applications. All those videos are available for your own DD on YouTube. I'm an investor, but just a little guy. I like the story. So at best this is a gamble on a pipe dream of an idea, we aren’t even to gambling on scaling yet. Has grapheme been used in a production chip used in “AI” at any scale beyond prototype? Graphene really does seem like a game-changer for AI. Its speed and heat conductivity could solve so many of the current limitations in processing power. The possibilities for more efficient and advanced AI are exciting, but it’s clear there are still some hurdles to overcome. Looking forward to seeing how it evolves! I believe Graphene will be one of the top three materials in the future. It’ll be used in damn near everything, potentially even semiconductors. It has almost otherworldly properties and characteristics. 

That could still be 20-30 years away sadly. It will hit one day and if you pick right it’ll be like getting Apple stock at .75 back in the day.  

I don’t see a stock currently that seems to have potential tho. Ngl he might be onto something :


- looking at his post history he has been into graphene for at least 3 years, wouldnt ne surprised if OP was working in something related to graphene.


- the company DD is not very convincing, but the hypothesis is valid and the stock still has room to grow, the recent jump shows there is interest in it. Honestly, i see why one can predict a bullish case here.


However as friday was tough for the markets as a whole, I am more scared of a conjonctural shift on monday, which will result in a bear market.

1mdw89f,2025-07-31,"$TPIC: Can pop like a MEME, though definitely not a MEME
TPI Composites (TPIC) has been left for dead, and rightfully so. Its balance sheet is a mess, profitability non-existent. Its sector is facing headwinds as far as the eye can see.* The current board members and CEO who have been around since pre-Covid have presided over enormous value destruction for a company which had a market cap hovering around $1 billion (from its 2016 listing to the start of Covid) to its current paltry $50 million.

And yet…

TPIC possesses extraordinary “franchise value.”  Here’s a company that is a global leader in the manufacturing of onshore composite wind blades. Ex-China, TPIC has a 27% global market share in 2024 (used to be >30% in the few years prior). Almost all of the world’s largest wind turbine OEMs are its customers (GE Vernova, Nordex, Vestas, etc.). This is an important player in the global supply chain for the energy of the future. This is NOT some company that churns out “me too” products or services in a highly fragmented industry. The strategic value of TPIC is huge!

The barriers to entry to produce cutting edge wind blades is insanely high. Think material complexity (complex chemistry and lay-up precision, small defects in air pockets and misaligned fibers can have catastrophic failure), extreme sizes (fabricating massive, lightweight, and aerodynamic components), structural engineering demands (light enough to spin effectively but strong enough to avoid fatigue or fracture), and limited automation (because of customized features). TPIC has had 24 years to perfect its craft since 2001. 

The company is in the process of evaluating its strategic options. At its core, the board and management made a mistake in issuing recklessly expensive preferred equity from Oaktree in late 2021—I think they panicked when they saw profitability vanished in the aftermath of Covid amidst supply chain issues, and worried about liquidity. By 2023, they had restructured the preferreds into a term loan carrying an all-in cost of 20% (11% coupon + 9% PIK). Only very few companies can withstand 20% cost of debt; TPIC with its historically modest profit margins isn’t one of them. Furthermore, the PIK made the board and management complacent. 

The hostility by the current administration towards anything renewables certainly makes things worse. Investor and sell-side analyst sentiment is clearly in the dog house. Pre-November 5, 2024 the share price was still trading in the $3 - $5/share range. Since then, it has spent some long portions of time below $1.

But I think Mr. Market is wrong.

A strong strategic investor who has a firm belief in the inexorable march towards a cleaner energy future will see a rare opportunity in TPIC. 

My thoughts on TPIC’s current value is as follows…

With the exception of last year ($1.3 billion), TPIC’s net annual revenues between 2019 to 2023 has been in the range of $1.4 to $1.7 billion. This year it is projected between $1.4 to $1.5 billion. During its periods of profitability, TPIC has achieved high-single digit adj-EBITDA margins. If we assume a 7% long-term adj-EBITDA margin off $1.4 billion (base-case long-term revenue run-rate, no growth), we get approximately $100 million in adj-EBITDA. If we apply a 7x EV/EBITDA multiple (average from other sources including Statista indicates a median of low teens EV/EBITDA multiple, https://www.enerdatics.com/insights/renewable-energy-m-a-pe-firms-are-dominating-acquisitions-of-renewables-developers-at-attractive-ev-ebitda-multiples), we get $700 million in enterprise value. Less the net debt of $400 million as of 1Q25, we get an equity value of $300 million (which equates to around $6/share), a far cry from the current market cap of around $50 million.

Again, the above assumes that TPIC can get to long-term, steady state—albeit no growth, profitability. The market says TPIC can’t get there, and I agree, IF it seeks to get there on its own. But if it gets acquired by a strong strategic player (think GE Vernova (market cap $178 billion as of 7/30/25) or Vestas, or Berkshire Hathaway Energy), TPIC has a strong pathway back towards relevance as it waits out the current headwinds being protected by a very strong parent.

The market is freaking out when it looks at the negative $400 million in book value and $400 million in net debt, with most of that debt being Oaktree’s 20% stiffer. But to a strong strategic acquirer with investment grade rating, it can easily refinance all that debt to a high single digit cost, shaving low teens in interest (say a 12% saving off $400 million is $48 million straight to the bottom line!). Also, buying at a $300 million valuation when book equity is negative $400 million will create $700 million in goodwill, which can be amortized (assuming certain purchase method employed, like an asset sale). At 20% tax rate and TPIC absorbed into the acquirer’s profitable operations, this creates $140 million in tax savings (20% x $700 million), albeit amortized over probably more than 10 years, but still meaningful!

The market is saying that the most simple way for TPIC to survive is to massively dilute existing shareholders at current market prices (<$1/share). True, that is the easiest way, but it is also the laziest and most incompetent way for the board to maximize shareholder value—although I have to admit, this is a risk.** To maximize shareholder value, there is no other way out except running into the arms of a strong strategic parent. And again, TPIC has announced that it is in the process of evaluating its strategic options (it has recently added 2 new board members with strong restructuring expertise). Can any strategic acquirer wait for the company to get into more trouble before making a move? It certainly can, but why risk further deterioration in operations, morale, and financial conditions when the company is already priced for bankruptcy?

Keep in mind that TPIC’s current single largest shareholder is the company’s Turkish partner (Dere Construction and its chairman, collectively “Dere"") with a 25% stake at a total cost of $2.4/share. I think that as a recent acquirer who has issued a 13-D filling with an intention to control, it will try very hard to protect its investment from going under. In fact, TPIC has gone silent in issuing a date for its 2024 AGM (the 2023 AGM took place on 5/29/24); ditto for announcing the date for its 2Q25 earnings results. Dere and TPIC had previously entered into a cooperation agreement which has since lapsed, and I suspect they have not been able to come to terms. If I were Dere, I will make sure that the board and senior management do what is right for its existing shareholders, at all cost.

Then there is the issue of TPIC’s short interest. As of 7/30/25, borrowing rates hover around 40%. Short interest is around 6 million shares, which represents around 18% of the 33 million free float. With 3-mo average daily volume of around 600k shares, that is around 10 days to cover. It will be interesting to see that assuming TPIC gets sold at fair value (say $6/share and above), what kind of a squeeze we can expect!

To recap:
- TPIC has incredible franchise value / strategic value.
- The market is forgetting that. The market figures the easiest way to salvage value is to issue cheap equity to pay down debt.
- If TPIC does the right thing and sells itself at fair value, the stock should pop.
- With a potential short squeeze, it can get even higher: like a MEME, though definitely NOT a MEME!

NOTE: THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, NOR A RALLYING CRY FOR COORDINATED ACTION. I THINK THE MARKET MAY HAVE MISSED SOMETHING, BUT THEN AGAIN I MAY BE WRONG—DUH. DO YOUR OWN DUE DILIGENCE.

* Well, actually not that far, but our recency bias makes it feel that way.

** The risk here is that the board with certain senior management act with vested interest to preserve their own perverse incentives. The recent authorization of retention bonuses to senior management by the board’s compensation committee does not look good.

1mdecye,2025-07-30,"Can Phoenix Motorcars restore trust in Proterra-built platforms?
Hey guys, remember Proterra? Well, It's technology may have survived its bankruptcy, now living on through Volvo’s battery division and Phoenix Motorcars’ bus operations, but its reputation remains tarnished. Fires, structural flaws, and reliability issues have cast a long shadow over its legacy.

While both Volvo and Phoenix are working to rebuild the brand’s core assets, the broader electric bus market continues to face tough real-world challenges, particularly around maintenance costs, infrastructure, and long-term durability.

As you might know, 2 years ago, Proterra filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and it was dismantled and sold in parts. The battery division was acquired by Volvo Group for $210 million. The bus manufacturing segment was taken over by Phoenix Motorcars, while Cowen Equity purchased the company’s charging infrastructure unit.

After Phoenix completed its acquisition, it began to produce buses modeled after Proterra’s original designs under its own branding. However, legacy issues have continued to surface.

In June 2025, approximately 40 electric buses were destroyed in a SEPTA depot fire, which investigators linked to battery components originally developed by Proterra. Additionally, structural problems in Proterra’s composite bus chassis—particularly fiberglass cracking and material degradation—have raised further safety concerns.

Additionally, Phoenix, is facing hurdles with Buy America compliance, delaying new bus deliveries. For instance, Iowa’s DART agency chose to retire its electric bus fleet earlier than planned due to maintenance burdens, despite acknowledging measurable benefits such as a 60 percent reduction in carbon emissions and 20 percent energy savings during the buses’ operational period.

So, the question remains: Can Phoenix rebuild confidence in the legacy of Proterra's technology?

In other PTRA news, investors have only 1 month left to submit their claims and receive payout from the $29 million Proterra settlement over financial risks, production inefficiencies, and strategic shifts. You can check the details and [submit your claim](https://11th.com/cases/proterra-investor-lawsuit).

1mdawys,2025-07-30,"PEW: Strong Fundamentals, Tight Float, Big Catalyst Ahead
I have been looking into PEW recently and started accumulating shares.

Unlike 90%+ of SPAC names, PEW posts positive net income. ~$100M cash on the books, with no debt.
Inventory and other tangible assets provide a real floor value.

Q1 revenue rose 12.3% YoY with a TTM revenue of $116.45 million, and Q2 earnings which is at Aug 14 will probably normalize margins now that SPAC costs are behind them.

This combination (profitability + cash + growth) is pretty unheard of in SPACS.
Most investors lump all SPACs together and ignore the few that actually have strong fundamentals. That’s an opportunity IMO. 

At current levels $6, the market values PEW close to its cash on hand and assigning almost no value to the business itself.

Alongside solid fundamentals, there’s a technical setup shorts are ignoring:

Institutions & insiders control ~88% of shares, Short interest is ~15% (~2.6M shares), Retail controls the rest, meaning tradable float is razor thin, Ownership claims exceed 100% of float, creating a negative float dynamic.

Now, Donald jr. is a 1% owner and on the board of this company. Which is a negative and positive. His presence may alienate certain investors or funds with ESG or politically neutral mandates. But also junior’s network opens doors to potential government contracts, partnerships, and favorable regulatory treatment. especially under a this administration.

PEW is  a profitable, cash heavy company with a share structure that could turn volatile real fast. With Q2 earnings around the corner and potential political tailwinds in play, the current price doesn’t reflect what is under the hood.
It’s minimum a $15 stock without fomo and without new catalyst. Imagine with fomo and new catalysts Ohhh, hell yeah, I love catching falling knives.  Just throw up like a dozen and I will happily run around like a little girl in a sprinkler trying to catch them all... This will have another dip you will be able to accumulate shares at the $5.80 price range PEW, the widowmaker. https://preview.redd.it/7mp878iqi1gf1.jpeg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ac3013bf9b9326c3f2956d27ac375a1f8a816538 You don’t have to buy in right now or at all. Once it’s up 20% or consolidated in a while it’s still a great opportunity. I was just talking about the financials. But thanks for your insights.

1md9jje,2025-07-30,"Formation Metals (FOMO Stock) Powers Up: Gold, Nickel, and More For a Clean Energy Future
**Formation Metals Inc.** (CSE:**FOMO**, OTCPK:**FOMTF**, FSE:**VF1**) is a Canadian exploration company focused on supplying minerals essential to modern technology and clean energy. While much attention has been given to its gold assets, the company is also advancing exploration for copper, zinc, nickel, and titanium. This multi-metal approach supports North America’s growing need for critical minerals and positions the company for long-term growth as demand continues to rise.

**Mining More Than Gold: Why FOMO’s Metals Mix Matters**

Critical minerals are vital to industries such as electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy, electronics, and national defense. Gold is used in electronics and valued as a store of wealth. Copper and zinc are essential for wiring, batteries, and large infrastructure projects. 

Nickel is a key ingredient in EV batteries, and demand for it could nearly double by 2030. From 2017 to 2022, the percentage of nickel used in batteries rose from 6% to 16%. Titanium, known for its strength and lightweight, plays an important role in aerospace and advanced manufacturing.

https://preview.redd.it/1s8g7qgk41gf1.jpg?width=1135&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef03dafddba39926ca2b012620fa1837ee9aeadb

Governments in Canada and the United States have identified these minerals as strategic resources. With growing pressure to build secure, local supply chains for clean energy, both countries are actively supporting domestic exploration and development of critical minerals. 

Canada, for instance, is the fourth-largest global producer of nickel and fifth in titanium. In 2024, the global nickel market was valued at around $37 billion and is expected to grow to $73 billion by 2032.

Notably, Canada faces a growing challenge to capture its share of a booming $65 billion critical minerals market. A new report warns that Canada risks losing up to $100 billion in investment by 2030 without faster permitting and better coordination. 

https://preview.redd.it/mzffhkkp41gf1.jpg?width=1009&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1f88dca5ddbaaef2aeeafa205e7dea19b0bc4e34

This matters to Formation Metals (FOMO), as its Quebec and Ontario projects—gold, nickel, copper, zinc, and titanium—align directly with national priorities. With Canada targeting 60% of global potash and 14% of nickel supply, FOMO’s focus on domestic, multi-metal exploration positions it to benefit from policy improvements and rising clean-tech demand.

**Exploring a Diversified Portfolio Across Canada**

Formation Metals’ flagship asset is the N2 Gold Project, located in Québec’s Abitibi Greenstone Belt—one of the world’s most productive gold regions. The project spans 87 claims covering approximately 4,400 hectares and is accessible by road year-round. It holds a historical gold resource of about 870,000 ounces, with large parts of the property still underexplored. 

https://preview.redd.it/7fwp6jlt41gf1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=16dc67c038db0c220095377d985e02cf81ee8b87

Recent reviews of historic drill core samples have revealed copper and zinc mineralization, suggesting the project’s value could extend beyond gold. This is important as demand for base metals like copper continues to rise, driven by growth in the EV sector and renewable infrastructure.

In addition to the N2 project, Formation Metals owns the Nicobat Project in Ontario, which is focused on nickel, copper, and cobalt—metals that are essential for batteries and clean energy systems. The company is also advancing an early-stage titanium project in Québec, aimed at serving aerospace, defense, and high-tech industries. 

By exploring a range of metals, Formation Metals spreads risk and creates multiple pathways to market success. This strategy enables the company to benefit even when the price of one commodity fluctuates.

**Strong Jurisdictions and Responsible Development**

All of Formation Metals’ assets are in Canada. The country is known for its political stability, clear mining rules, and skilled workers. Québec and Ontario are top mining regions. They provide reliable infrastructure and clear permitting processes. These strengths help reduce project risk and improve the efficiency of development.

FOMO also prioritizes responsible exploration. The company works with local governments, municipalities, and Indigenous communities. This helps ensure their projects respect local interests and meet environmental standards. This commitment supports long-term success and reflects the expectations of today’s investors and regulators.

**Backed for Big Exploration in 2025**

As of mid-2025, Formation Metals maintains a strong financial position, with about C$2.8 million in working capital. It recently completed a private placement to fund continued exploration. 

The company is fully financed for a 20,000-metre drill program at the N2 Gold Project. The first phase, covering 5,000 metres, is already underway. This drill program focuses on expanding known gold zones and testing new areas for copper and zinc mineralization. Systematic exploration like this is essential for uncovering a project’s full resource potential.

**Riding the Wave of Clean Tech Demand**

The company’s multi-metal strategy fits well with current global market trends. In 2025, gold prices reached record highs above $3,400 per ounce, driven by economic uncertainty and strong central bank demand. 

https://preview.redd.it/wp1vdi4v41gf1.jpg?width=766&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d3bf7a2bbf53b10f7e0c49583d8a1b8e182a2ae

At the same time, copper demand is expected to grow by 30% by the mid-2020s. This rise is mainly driven by electric vehicle production and power grid upgrades. Nickel demand is also increasing as EV adoption grows and stainless steel production expands. The global market for nickel-based batteries alone could grow from USD 2.34 billion in 2025 to USD 2.82 billion by 2030.

**Key Market Highlights:**

* **Gold**: Prices above $3,400/oz in 2025, driven by investor demand.
* **Copper**: 30% demand growth forecast due to EVs and grid expansion.
* **Nickel**: Market value to nearly double from USD 37B (2024) to USD 73B (2032).
* **Battery-grade nickel**: Projected growth from USD 2.34B (2025) to USD 2.82B (2030).
* **Titanium and zinc**: Strong demand in aerospace and infrastructure.

By targeting both precious and base metals, Formation Metals can benefit from several market forces at once. This diversified approach allows the company to create shareholder value even if one metal’s price declines. It also aligns with national efforts to secure domestic supplies of essential minerals.

**Stability and Opportunity in Critical Minerals**

Looking ahead, Formation Metals is positioned for growth as it continues to develop its projects. With a fully funded exploration program, strong financial footing, and projects located in top mining jurisdictions, the company is advancing assets that are critical to the future of clean energy and high-tech industries.

As global demand for critical minerals continues to grow, companies with diversified portfolios and responsible development strategies are likely to play a major role. Formation Metals’ focus on gold, copper, zinc, nickel, and titanium gives it broad exposure to several high-demand sectors. 

Its multi-metal strategy and commitment to sustainable development offer both stability and upside potential for investors. Formation Metals is more than a gold explorer—it is helping to secure the resources needed for a cleaner, more sustainable future.
With copper and zinc in the mix, could N2 evolve beyond just a gold story?

1md4iz2,2025-07-30,"MVST Q2 earnings Boost
**Overview:** Microvast Holdings, Inc. specializes in battery technologies for electric vehicles and energy storage solutions, with a market cap of approximately $1.09 billion.

**Operations:** Microvast Holdings generates revenue primarily from its Batteries / Battery Systems segment, which accounts for $414.94 million.

**Market Cap:** $1.09B

Microvast Holdings, Inc. has recently been added to multiple Russell indexes, indicating increased visibility among investors. Despite a volatile share price, the company reported US$116.49 million in first-quarter sales for 2025 and turned profitable with a net income of US$61.79 million compared to a loss last year. However, it remains unprofitable over the long term with losses increasing at 0.6% annually over five years and maintains high debt levels relative to equity at 41.2%. With strong revenue growth projections between US$450 million and US$475 million for 2025, Microvast's financial position is bolstered by short-term assets exceeding liabilities but faces challenges in sustaining cash runway if free cash flow continues decreasing.



  
Q2 earnings 7 August, This could easy go from 3.25$ back to 4,6$ or even 5$

Could be a easy penny flips IF earnings are beat again.
Microvast has been very good to me. Might be the least talked about stock on here. Been accumulating MVST the last few months

Earnings reports and pre earnings have consistently been extremely good for MVST https://preview.redd.it/78p1aamc50gf1.png?width=638&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ad0beee0db6e6693c5bcf9038ae2428d2922411

He's the man Last one was pretty cool, got this since january because of reddit, but i should had buy everything i could in april, 1,15$ to 4,6$ 

But this time i guess it's a easy 3,25-5$ next earnings will put us 2B+ cap which is about $6+ Hey add this to your DD, copied from some of my convos with people earlier ( I already bought calls for earnings):

Thinking about MVST heading into this Q2 earnings drop on August 8th.

The company's been on a tear with record revenue growth already showing in Q1 and they're sticking hard to their full-year guidance of $450-475 million for 2025, which is like 18-25% year-over-year pop. They've steadily been demonstrating beating earnings by wide margins.

Dark pool whales are apparently accumulating shares hinting at a Q2 revenue midpoint around $118 million or so, beating whispers, plus analysts are eyeing positive EPS by next year. 118 milly rev is on track for their full-year guidance.

For the short-squeeze angle, short interest is sitting at around 15-16% of the float with about 30 million shares shorted and days to cover pushing 3.5, so if earnings surprise to the upside and force some covering, the stock could spike hard.

Lithium prices were super low in Q2 2025, around $8,329 per ton for battery-grade stuff, so Microvast’s getting their materials dirt cheap while Europe’s EV market is popping off, up 34% for battery EVs. That’s a sweet setup for fatter margins, which could make their $118 million revenue target for Q2 look even better and drive a nice earnings beat.

Here's ACEA's Q2 report on EVs:[https://www.acea.auto/pc-registrations/new-car-registrations-1-9-in-h1-2025-battery-electric-15-6-market-share/](https://www.acea.auto/pc-registrations/new-car-registrations-1-9-in-h1-2025-battery-electric-15-6-market-share/)

The ACEA Q2 report on commercial EVs drops tomorrow, so if numbers are showing a similar trend, it's all but guaranteed to pop off with your girl giving you the lock jaw.

So all through out Q2 ending June 30th, Lithium was at record lows. Whatever they decide to sell at from now on with acquired materials will be at a profit, dead simple. They had a back log on top of strong commercial EV demand in Europe throughout the time period.

The biggest hurdles are infrastructure, and as a battery supplier with dense, fast charging SS batteries, I personally think this earnings is going to be a net positive, catalyzing a move higher in stock price as the market slowly wakes up to the reality.

1md4ihx,2025-07-30,"$GRAB - A stock to keep an eye on
The primary opportunity for Grab lies in its ability to aggregate demand across various services. Unlike Uber, whose core business is centered around mobility, Grab's largest segment is its food delivery service, which is complemented by a robust financial services division. This unique positioning allows Grab to evolve into a demand-driven platform, converting users of its food delivery or financial services into mobility users through bundled subscriptions, such as Grab Unlimited. Drivers are incentivized to join Grab not solely for commissions but because it is where demand is concentrated. This dynamic contrasts with Uber's strategy, which primarily leverages its extensive mobility user base to expand its food delivery business.
[deleted] Grab is great. I lived in Southeast Asia for 5 years and used it for transport. Even hopping to neighbouring countries, using the app was seamless. What excites me is their expansion into supermarkets meaning actually owning them, instead of just delivering groceries from them. Grab is basically Uber + Uber Eats.

1md456q,2025-07-30,"$RADX Radiopharm Theranostics - on the brink of changing the landscape of radiopharmaceuticals and primed as a takeover target by Big Pharma
Radiopharm Theranostics is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of radiopharmaceutical products, with 6 out of 7 currently in preclinical or Phase 1 studies. The most advanced candidate (RAD101) is an imaging candidate for brain metastases that's currently in a Phase 2b trial, with a read-out expected in the next few months. Two additional Phase 1 trials are also expecting data readouts in the next few months, both for solid tumors. 

https://i.imgur.com/xtsxN3w.png


FA-wise, the upcoming topline results are of course a binary event for RADX, however there are some positive ""hidden signs"" that the results may be strong. For example, the RAD share registry is loaded with instos and Big Pharma company Lantheus, who is arguably the biggest radiopharmaceuticals business in the world (market cap US$5.39 billion), with top 20 shareholders now owning >80% shares on issue. **Lantheus also has a 12.12% stake in the company, and in January 2025, completed a private placement at $11 per share, which represented a 150% premium at the time. If Lantheus are happy to keep injecting money into Radiopharm, then it means they see dollar signs.** 


Lots of instos and US health funds are also on the registry and looking for a high return on their investment. This Top 20 holders chart is in ASX shares (1 RADX = 300 RAD), and Lantheus also has an additional 133m shares that's not in this chart, but there's an announcement dated January 9th 2025 with their share holding increasing: 

https://www.marketindex.com.au/asx/rad/announcements/lantheus-increases-shareholding-in-rad-with-a8m-placement-2A1573114

https://i.imgur.com/wVadcOW.png




Some relevant company info. Radiopharm is a dual-listed on the ASX under ticker $RAD and the Nasdaq exchange under ticker $RADX, but recently the Nasdaq listing is seeing much higher volumes than the ASX. Some stats are in respect to the Australian stock price, but I will try my best to use the Nasdasq listing. The share price between exchanges converts to 1 RADX == 300 RAD shares, and then you convert between AUD/USD. 


https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/radx

https://www.asx.com.au/markets/company/RAD



The share price previously pumped up to US$50 on zero news on December 6th 2024, although it was a bit of a pump and dump on extremely low volume as we didn't reach anywhere near this high on the ASX the next day. On March 3rd 2025, shares on the Nasdaq pumped up 100% to US$11 on zero news before drifting back down to ~US$5, and share turnover was over 2.2B ASX shares (~7.7M Nasdaq ADR's), which is almost the entire float. 

1 year chart: https://i.imgur.com/UaNeXGu.png


**And oh boy do I love talking about Lantheus. RADX is also a prime takeover target by Lantheus, who currently owns 12.12% of the company and has license deals for two RADX assets. As long as RADX show they are capable, meet their timelines and deliver program work results, Lantheus will continue to ""stay close to them"". Takeover?**

RADX has recently had a lot of chatter across different discord investment groups after the company had an IND application approved with the FDA on July 28th 2025 for state-of-the-art prostate cancer so there's already a lot of attention on this stock. You can confirm that by checking the company's stocktwits: https://stocktwits.com/symbol/RADX

- March 2025: B.Riley Securities: US$15

- May 2025: Maxim Group: US$12

- May 2025: ThinkEquity: US$15

With the increasing demand for zero emission vehicles and the need to create a circular economy, the battery recycling industry is inevitably set to see new and prosperous growth opportunities.And with lithium coming up off a multi year price slide there’s not better time to get cheap cheap shares!

For those that don’t know. Recyclico Battery materials has a patent in which they can complete the whole circular process making an old battery’s into new material on a molecular level that is ready to be made into a new battery! With second to none recycling process for lithium ion battery’s. The efficiency is remarkable with a 99% return on metals (3rd party tested) patent for a closed-loop hydrometallurgical process.

NO-ONE ELSE DOES THIS. All Competition gets the black mass and sends its away for the processes for cathode material on a molecular level.

It’s about time This tech is turning heads!
Yeah that’s what I’m thinking. Their tech is just too good to not become mainstream. Once they implement it and start generating revenue I can see this expanding FAST 

The risk to reward here is unparalleled

1mcexn8,2025-07-29,"“Two Key Points in GAMB’s Share Price Decline: Marketing Uncertainty and the Impact of the BBB Act”
https://preview.redd.it/c6f1vqgd3uff1.png?width=1041&format=png&auto=webp&s=600b407cbc20af3706991a8f489bac976a1eaccb

https://preview.redd.it/o5y2508i3uff1.png?width=868&format=png&auto=webp&s=efb0a58e221a0b08e3fc43469beb9fb3b947a472

GAMB looks extremely attractive from a fundamentals‑driven, value‑investing perspective—and in reality, it is.

**First, a brief overview of** [**Gambling.com**](http://Gambling.com) **(GAMB).**  
The company’s core business model is affiliate marketing: it drives traffic (i.e., users) to online betting sites and earns revenue in return. This segment accounts for about 75 percent of total revenue. The remaining 25 percent comes from Odds Holdings, which GAMB acquired on January 1 of this year; Odds Holdings operates a subscription service that supports arbitrage bettors and charges a subscription fee. There are a few other minor revenue streams, but they’re negligible enough to skip.

I believe the company has many strengths and a bright outlook, but I’d like to explain why its share price has been in a persistent downtrend recently. I think most of these points will resonate with you. :)

**1. Uncertainty around growth in the marketing business**  
Recently, it appears that [Gambling.com](http://Gambling.com) didn’t respond adequately to Google’s 2025 SEO policy and algorithm changes, resulting in a drop in organic traffic to its domain. While there are some signs of recovery, this issue goes beyond a simple decline in new customers. After Google’s 2024 algorithm update, many online‑betting affiliate firms saw their revenues and margins shrink dramatically, and their share prices fell by an average of over 50 percent. At that time, GAMB’s traffic remained stable—an ideal opportunity to gain market share. Instead, investors worry that this isn’t just a one‑off event and that GAMB could lose market share going forward.

**2. Risk of a collapse in the legal arbitrage‑betting market under the “Big Beautiful Bill”**  
Personally, I see this as the more serious concern. Under the BBB Act, U.S. tax law will change in 2026 from taxing only net gambling profits to including 10 percent of gambling losses in taxable income. In other words, if you record $10,000 in profits and $10,000 in losses in a year, you’ll owe taxes on $10,000 of “phantom income.” Investors fear this could devastate the arbitrage‑betting market, which relies on exploiting sub‑1 percent odds differentials across thousands of trades. In a worst‑case scenario, rotating $10,000 through 1,000 trades (totaling $10 million), with $5 million in wins and $5 million in losses, would leave you liable for tax on $500,000 of phantom income. Some may argue such volume is unrealistic, but markets hate uncertainty. One could even imagine the full $80 million spent on the Odds Holdings acquisition being written off

**Conclusion**  
From a pure value standpoint, GAMB remains highly attractive. However, until these uncertainties are resolved, I personally think it’s wise to hold off on investing. Of course, if the share price were to drop another 10 percent or more, I’d be ready to buy aggressively

1mcemke,2025-07-29,"$PSTV The actual near future 10x-20x bagger with an FDA cleared 6B drug
$PSTV is sitting at **$0.52/share** with a tiny **$35M market cap**... but it has a monopoly-like asset in CNSide, an already FDA-cleared diagnostic targeting leptomeningeal metastases (brain/spine tumor spread). Total U.S. market size: **~$6 billion**.

This isn’t a “maybe someday” drug. CNSide is **approved**, fully acquired, and expected to **enter the commercial market in late 2025**. They’re targeting ramp-up and distribution in 2025–2026.

The best part? **There’s no real competition in this diagnostic space.**

Let’s break down how big this could be 

| Market Share | Revenue (Est.) | 4x Sales Valuation | Share Price (Est.) |
|--------------|----------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| 5%           | $300M          | $1.2B              | ~$18/share          |
| 10%          | $600M          | $2.4B              | ~$36/share          |
| 25%          | $1.5B          | $6.0B              | ~$90/share          |



Now compare that to today's reality:

- **Share price: $0.52**

- **Market cap: $35M**

- **No dilution risk (they just cancelled their $100M S-3!)**

- **No competition**

- **Commercial launch within ~6–14 months**

- **Only US market, worldwide would increase the total addressable market by much more.** 

The market is just sleeping on this one. Either they think it won’t launch, or they haven’t priced in revenue. But when CNSide starts printing even modest sales, rerating happens fast — especially with biotechs this small.

Not financial advice, but this has real upside potential if they execute. Target: $2–$5 pre-launch hype, and much higher if revs start hitting in 2026.

1mce5n1,2025-07-29,"Sarepta Therapeutics
I bought Sarepta Therapeutics, got good news yesterday from FDA and its so undervalued. Target price $150 per share

is sarepta therapeutics inc stock undervalued?Analyzing Sarepta Therapeutics Inc. (SRPT) stock for undervaluation presents a mixed picture.**Arguments for Undervaluation:**

* **Positive Revenue Growth:** Sarepta has demonstrated strong revenue growth, with a 1-year growth rate of 39.2% and a 5-year growth rate of 26.9%.
* **Low Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio:** The P/S ratio of 0.68 is significantly lower than the industry median of 10.07, suggesting potential undervaluation.
* **Potential Upside from Elevidys:** Recent FDA recommendation to lift the hold on Elevidys for ambulatory DMD patients could boost future revenue and potentially impact the stock price positively.
* **Analyst Sentiment:** Some analysts see significant upside potential, with an average one-year price target of $30.28, implying a 74.22% increase from the current trading price of $17.38. GuruFocus estimates a potential 1147.47% upside with a projected GF Value of $216.81. 

**Mixed Analyst Opinions:**

* **JPMorgan:** Upgraded Sarepta to Neutral with a $24 price target after the FDA recommended lifting the Elevidys hold.
* **Oppenheimer:** Upgraded Sarepta to Outperform with a $37 price target, viewing the FDA recommendation as positive for the company's future.
* **Bernstein:** Initiated coverage with a Market Perform rating and a $13 price target, expressing skepticism about Elevidys' future financial impact. 

**Conclusion:**Sarepta's stock valuation is complex. The company shows promise in revenue growth and potential from Elevidys, but it also faces significant financial and operational challenges, including profitability concerns and regulatory risks. Investors should carefully weigh these factors, along with mixed analyst opinions, when evaluating potential investment opportunities

1mc9bts,2025-07-29,"New SEC Filing : USAS - Americas Gold & Silver
**AMERICAS GOLD AND SILVER CORPORATION ANNOUNCES STRONG 54% QUARTERLY INCREASE IN Q2 2025 PRODUCTION RESULTS**

 

**TORONTO, ONTARIO** – July 29, 2025 – Americas Gold and Silver Corporation (the “Company” or “Americas”) (TSX:USA; NYSE American: USAS) is pleased to announce strong consolidated silver production of 689,000 ounces for the second quarter of 2025, an increase of 54% compared to 446,000 ounces produced in the first quarter of 2025.

 

Americas’ unaudited consolidated cash balance as at June 30, 2025 was US$61.7 million, an increase of US$52.9 million compared to March 31, 2025. The increased cash balance benefited from the receipt of the first tranche (US$50 million) of the previously announced US$100 million senior secured debt facility (“Term Loan Facility”) and the receipt of US$11.5 million from a non-brokered private placement which was a pre-condition to the Term Loan Facility (see Americas news releases dated June 3, 2025, and June 25, 2025). During the second quarter, the Company continued to deploy capital into its revitalization and growth plan in line with its budget.

 

Paul Andre Huet, Chairman and CEO Commented: “I am extremely pleased with our very strong second quarter results which were a 54% improvement on the first quarter of this year. After spending significant effort underground at Galena conducting numerous time studies, engineering work, productivity-focused projects and implementing both new equipment and adjusting the mining method, our operation in Idaho delivered a 34% quarter-over-quarter increase – a tremendous result by the team. At Cosalá, outstanding efforts by our operating team delivered a 103% improvement on the first quarter as the operation progresses on schedule towards the transition into EC120 later this year. Overall, we are delighted with the results across our operations after just two quarters at the helm with the new combined team working very well together.

 

The strong second quarter production and our significantly bolstered balance sheet have set us up with the resources we need to continue executing on the initial phases of our operational strategy focused on unlocking the massive potential of our asset base for our shareholders.

 

Overall, our operational performance in the first half of 2025 puts us in a very favourable position with respect to achieving our goals for 2025 as we build our growth momentum. We look forward to providing further updates as we continue our 2025 development and drill programs.

 

**About Americas Gold and Silver Corporation**

 

[Americas Gold & Silver is a growing precious metals mining company with multiple assets in North America. In December 2024, Americas increased its ownership in the Galena Complex (Idaho, USA) from 60% to 100% in a transaction with Eric Sprott, solidifying its position as a silver-focused producer. Americas also owns and operates the Cosalá Operations in Sinaloa, Mexico. Eric Sprott is the Company’s largest shareholder, holding an approximate 20% interest. Americas has a proven and experienced management team led by Paul Huet, is fully funded to execute its growth plans, and focused on becoming one of the top North American silver plays, with an objective of over 80% of its revenue to be generated from silver by the end of 2025.]()

1mc6z9q,2025-07-29,"Q2 Results + MAKE90: The 2 big catalysts for SeaStar Medical are approaching
I've done these write-ups before and it feels like a nice moment to do so again. With this, see below for a breakdown of what I (and many others) see as the two major upcoming catalysts for $ICU. Please do share your thoughts as well :-)

**Q2 Earnings (Expected mid-August)**  
Q1 revenue came in at $293k, up significantly from $68k in Q4 2024. All existing hospitals reordered, and one new hospital placed its first order during Q1. Since then, SeaStar has added additional pediatric centers (including top-ranked ones like Texas Children’s) so revenue in Q2 should grow again.

Still, management warned during Q1 earning call that revenue will be “lumpy” at this early stage due to onboarding times and IRB approval processes. This call was almost precisely in the middle of Q2, so unfortunately doesn't raise too much trust in (significantly) improved sales for Q2. Some estimates point to $300k - $500k in Q2 revenue, but it logically depends on the pace of adoption. A strong Q2 could further validate the commercial story for QUELIMMUNE and create short-term upside, while a flat quarter could weigh on sentiment. My expectations for Q3 are significantly better, as ICU already added 2 major hospitals early in the quarter and are about to close (at least) two more.

**MAKE90 interim readout (expected end of Q3)**  
We’re getting close to the interim analysis for the NEUTRALIZE-AKI trial. My guess is that we're nearing 130 of 200 patients are enrolled at moment of writing and the 90-day follow-up should conclude in August. If the DSMB sees overwhelming efficacy they could recommend a halt to the trial. That would, logically, be massive. I am not expecting this to happen. If something sifnificant will happen, I think a shortened trial (to +- 150 patients for example) would be more realistic - happy to be wrong here.

This is rare in biotech but not unheard of. SeaStar themselves have said the trial population is tightly selected for those most likely to benefit, and they remain confident that the SCD therapy can meaningfully improve MAKE90 outcomes.

If I'm not mistaken there are four possible outcomes:

1. **Trial Halted for Efficacy** \- Major upside and likely rerating of the stock. No doubt best possible scenario.
2. **Trial shortened** \- Still a big upside with positive effect on SP.
3. **Continue as Planned** \- Still good news, just a longer timeline to approval (compared to shortened / halt). Fairly confident that this will be the outcome.
4. **Negative Data** \- Worst-case scenario; likely destroys the investment case.

**Cash Position and Dilution Risk**  
SeaStar had 5.3M cash at end of Q1 and raised another $4M in July. Burn rate is 3.5M to 4M per quarter, so they should be okay through early 2026 (assuming no major setbacks). But if there's no halt, they’ll almost certainly need more funding before adult commercialisation. I'm also taking into account that we might get another offering the next weeks, as Seastar needs to stay compliant with the minimal equity rule. Cash / dilution is my only real worry of investing in ICU, but clearly not worrying enough as I've put a significant amount of my $$$ here. Currently at 22.5M shares outstanding (without warrants), I'm thinking we will be around 40M to 50M end of the day fully diluted.

**My Take**  
The next 4 to 8 weeks will be business critical. If Q2 revenue shows real traction AND the interim data is strong, the entire investment thesis changes. We go from a speculative small-cap burn story to a real player in critical care. I’m cautiously optimistic and have added shares recently, but I know this is a high-risk, high-reward setup.

What’s your view and current sentiment with ICU? No worries at all? Confident but not 100% convinced yet? Awaiting IA before jumping in? Would love to hear from bulls, bears, and everyone in between. Cheers!

*Disclaimer: I hold 25k shares with a 2.04 average.*
Probably sounding like the biggest pumper, but if you read in well (or follow the Seastar Medical sub) it's not even unrealistic - I'm looking for high double digits at least, if not triple diggets. If the halt comes in about 1.5 months time, the TAM is about 4B. With <30M shares outstanding... I'm not even kidding when I say triple digits. Of course DYOR, but with the product being actively sold (and expanded customers with top 10 hospitals) and the amount of recognition they get from FDA, DoD and more... It's such a no brainer to take the gamble. Goodluck!

1mbvpc7,2025-07-28,"$TNFA: Potential short squeeze and it might go to $1.
Why I think TNFA will go to $1 in coming days?

Reasons: 

1. Novel Drug Platform
TNFA is developing Isomyosamine (MYMD‑1) — an oral TNF-α inhibitor aimed at chronic inflammation, muscle loss in aging, and weight-loss drug side effects (e.g. Ozempic-induced frailty). It’s a potentially safer, cheaper alternative to current injectable biologics.

2. Targeting Big Markets
	•	Sarcopenia (muscle loss), rheumatoid arthritis, and frailty are billion-dollar markets.
	•	New focus: GLP‑1 users (Wegovy/Ozempic) who are losing muscle with fat — a hot, fast-growing segment.

3. Early Clinical Success
Positive Phase 2 results in muscle loss and ongoing trials in fracture recovery. AI partnerships aim to cut trial costs and timelines.

4. Strategic Backing
Recent funding at a 20% premium and support from Prevail Partners to accelerate trials.

5. Tiny Market Cap, High Upside
At under $0.15, the stock trades near all-time lows — offering big upside if trials succeed.

Bottom Line:

TNFA is a high-risk, high-reward biotech play with exciting science and upside — but only for speculative investors who can stomach volatility.
50k shares and buying more tomorrow and holding for $1 so I don’t have to eat ballsack meat for dinner every night  No catalyst until March 2026 and the company has no income You better off holding your breath. 

Never trust AI generated posts that do not list dooming risks. No catalyst, this purely squeeze play. Potential good pump Im in.

1mbtum8,2025-07-28,"🚨 Copper Is the New Oil – And $NEXM Is Sitting on a Freaking Goldmine 🚨
**📈 TL;DR**

While everyone else is hyper-focused on overpriced AI stocks, the real **next oil rush is in copper**, and NEXM is sitting on the motherlode.

Copper isn’t just another metal—it’s the **circulatory system of electrification, AI, and defense**. The world’s running dry, and when the market wakes up, supply shock = 🚀.

NEXM isn’t a “hope and pray” penny miner—it’s a **revival story** with everything lined up: high-grade resources, existing infrastructure, strong backers, and catalysts primed for 2025.

The world’s running headfirst into a **copper crisis**—and the suits on Wall Street are asleep at the wheel. Meanwhile, **NexMetals Mining (Nasdaq: NEXM)** is chilling in Botswana with two past-producing copper-nickel complexes, shafts ready, power on tap, and billions in untapped metal.

Here’s the play:

**Copper = Systemic Lifeblood of the Economy**

* Every **electric car**, **data center**, and **renewable energy project** needs copper like your lungs need oxygen.
* One EV = **100+ lbs of copper**, solar/wind = **tons of wiring**, AI data centers = copper highways for power.
* Governments are **stockpiling copper** like it’s wartime oil. No copper = no green energy transition.

And guess what? **You can’t just “replace” copper**. Aluminum? Worse conductivity. Alternatives? Years away.

**⛏️ Supply is FUBAR**

* Tariffs just sent copper screaming past $5.60/lb.
* Discoveries have **collapsed since 2010**, and new mines take **10+ years** to open.
* Most supply = politically shaky regions. One strike or coup = instant copper shockwave.

**💎 Why NEXM Could Send Faces to the Shadow Realm**

* **High-Grade Assets:** Selebi Complex + Selkirk Mine = **70M+ tonnes** of copper-nickel, with hits like **27m @ 5.9% CuEq** (absolute chad grades).
* **Already Permitted:** Shafts, power, water, rail—**production fast-tracked** while competitors are stuck in red tape.
* **Big Money Backing:** Frank Giustra (the Wheaton Precious Metals guy) and EdgePoint dumped $67M in.
* **U.S. Export-Import Bank** circling with a potential $150M deal.
* **Botswana = Safe Jurisdiction:** No coups, no nationalizations—just copper tendies.
* **Catalyst Grenades:** Hinge Zone drilling, metallurgy upgrades, and ore-sorting tech could **supercharge grades**.

🔑 **Watch $NEXM. Set alerts. Remember where you heard it when this rips.** 🦍💎🚀

1mbjm25,2025-07-28,"$PSTV – Legit sleeper biotech w/ real near-term catalysts
$PSTV – Legit sleeper biotech w/ real near-term catalysts

Trading under $1 and flying under the radar. Just filed to WITHDRAW their S-3 offering – which means no dilution for now. That alone is rare in this market (IXHL anyone?). Here’s why I’m watching:

✔️ They specialize in targeted radiotherapeutics for rare, aggressive cancers – like glioblastoma (GBM) and leptomeningeal metastases (LM). Big unmet needs.

✔️ Lead candidate Rhenium-186 is in Phase 1/2 trials for multiple indications and has Orphan Drug + Fast Track designation.

✔️ Key upcoming catalyst: REYOBIQ (rhenium Re186 obisbemeda) - (ReSPECT-LM) Phase 1 data to be presented at SNO/ASCO on August 15, 2025. Phase 2 trial initiation planned.  3


✔️ Key upcoming catalyst 2 : CNSide - (FORESEE) Presentation due at SNO/ASCO CNS on August 14, 2025. Trial data reported that the trial achieved its primary endpoint, demonstrating that CNSide influenced treatment decisions in over 90% of cases, surpassing the 20% primary endpoint target, noted August 13, 2024. Additional trial data demonstrated enhanced sensitivity in detecting tumor cells (80%) vs. CSF cytology (29%) in patients with LM, noted November 22, 2024. 


✔️ Recently granted FDA Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for LM – this opens up eligibility for a priority review voucher, worth $$$ if granted.

✔️ Clean cap table for now – no recent dilution, and they pulled the S-3. Either they’re confident in data or another non-dilutive funding route is coming.

✔️ Plus Therapeutics has restructured its $15 million equity financing to eliminate potential dilution of up to 1.5 billion shares.


✔️ Market cap is under $35M. One good PR and this thing could fly, like we’ve seen happen with other sub-$1 biotechs recently.



Target: 1.8–4$  short-term if data is clean.
It'll be a worry if they release the news with no partnership or buyout.
Makes zero sense to cancel dilution without backup plan PSTV caught my attention back in July and I concluded its worth the risk.  At the time I purchased, it was around $.30 per share.  The most likely risk if the bottom drops out, it would settle around the 52-week low of $.16 per share.  So call it a 50% loss risk.  Regarding the potential upside, we could see $10 per share within 12 months.  A minority of analysts set a target even higher.  I'm taking the gamble.  The 2000%+ upside is too plausible to ignore. I got a voting email for a 1 for 250 reverse split, are we not worried about that? ![gif](giphy|1mzUamtQPTJW8)

PSTV!!!!! I'm genuinely worried by how much cash they burn. Annual net loss \~$27M, with Q1 2025 alone at $17M Sometimes you just got that good feeling. 🚀 Been watching this stock, you're right that's strange af, why did they withdrawed the shelf offering if they have negative cash flows every quarter and 0 revenue. Maybe confidence in the future of the company? Buyout or partnership? It's really suspicious, I'm in.

1mbj328,2025-07-28,"LPSN - from Frigerifico
Upcoming earnings could be the moment the market wakes up and LPSN bites back.

Sam Altman just gave everyone a preview of the AI jobs apocalypse and accidentally handed LivePerson a neon sign saying “Undervalued Opportunity Here.” Speaking at the Federal Reserve, the OpenAI CEO warned that customer support roles are the most vulnerable to extinction from generative AI.

His words?

“It does not make mistakes. It’s very quick… You call once, the thing just happens. It’s done.” Sound familiar?

That’s literally LivePerson’s product. And it's not theoretical: it's deployed, proven, and integrated into the operations of major banks, insurers, and healthcare providers. It handles regulated data and offers human-in-the-loop controls. It's not just an LLM in a trench coat as many AIs seem to be, instead it’s a mature, enterprise-grade, plug-and-play AI solution.

Now compare that with SoundHound ($SOUN):

Market cap: $4.7B 2025 revenue guidance: $157M–$177M YoY growth: 150% Gross margin: 51% Net income last 4 years: >-$640M total 33% short interest No profits. No path to profits.

Then look at LivePerson ($LPSN): Market cap: ~$100M Revenue guidance for 2025: $230-240M (thanks for edit Ravi) On track to be profitable in Q1 2026 Enterprise-ready tech stack in regulated markets Clear cost-reduction trajectory via cloud migration Revamped pricing raising avg. revenue per customer

Valuation is 47x lower than SOUN, with better fundamentals and a more mature product. Let that sink in. SOUN loses more money, makes less revenue, and is more shorted… yet trades like it's the second coming of Google Voice.

So what’s happening with LivePerson now?

Turnarounds take time. Earnings are lagging indicators. But forward momentum is everything. Here’s what to watch for in upcoming earnings (expected early August):

Last quarter of YoY revenue contraction. If they hit ~$58M this quarter and next, they'll hit the low end of full-year guidance. Hit ~$65M+ in either Q3/Q4? That’s above the top end. Revenue growth returns. Profitability is projected for Q1 2026… that’s months away, not years.

New pricing models are increasing revenue per customer. Legacy loss-making deals are getting dumped, long term, this is a net positive.

Cloud migration is reducing capex needs. No more hosting infrastructure = faster, cheaper scaling. Sales team restructured. Some larger deals could be announced in this earnings, likely tied to that $15M gap between low and high end guidance.

Delisting risk evaporates if they stay above $1 for a few more sessions, that lifts a psychological and mechanical weight on the stock.

New board member recently added, another sign the activist investors aren’t here to babysit. They want performance.

Market expected to 10x, the conversational AI sector is projected to grow from $14B to $140B in 5–7 years. Even 1% of that pie is several times current revenue.

What’s the trade here?

The story is setting up like a spring:

Compressed valuation ✅ Recurring revenue ✅ Inflection point in growth trajectory ✅ Product validated by the exact AI trends Sam Altman says are coming ✅ Near-term catalyst (earnings) ✅ High short interest with high float shorting but not crowded ✅

This might be the last quarter it gets called a ""turnaround."" After that?

It’s a growth stock again. With AI tailwinds.

If the plan holds and the new management keeps delivering $1 per share could go down in hindsight as the dumbest price Wall Street ever offered for an AI infrastructure play.

As always: risk management matters. But sometimes, so does recognising value before the crowd does.

💬 Not financial advice just a trader connecting dots
Beeen in LPSN, don’t use LLMs to write this Do you think they will dilute shares this year? What’s their cash runway look like ?

Burn victims In a matter of seconds during the initial patient visit, DeepView predicts¹ if the wound will heal or not, with remarkable accuracy, and up to 7 days post-injury. The DeepView System's potential to provide this assessment immediately could significantly impact treatment decisions, potentially reducing unnecessary surgeries while ensuring timely interventions when needed.

It gives crucial Data when it is needed the most , live & guided by AI . Cuts down on time, money, resources spent , all the while boosting patient probability of recovery & healing. 

MDAI is also exploring other avenues , such as diagnosing Diabetic Foot Ulcers . I'm not too familiar with this segment, but this launches in 2026/2027.

And has potential for military contract. In for 500 shares 🚀 Nice DD, about to buy a couple thousand shares for a 2-4 year hold minimum. I’ll scoop as much as I can under $3 and see how it fairs with FDA approval and commercial sales. What happens when it goes fully commercial in regards to the BARDA funding?

8. HCWC posted on July 2nd - down 1% (long hold for patient apes)
9. CHRS posted on July 16th - up 18.8% (Christmas came early)

THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. I LITERALLY CANNOT SPELL ""FINANCIAL"" WITHOUT AUTOCORRECT.

# The Company (or Why I'm About to Lose My Wife's Boyfriend's Money)

Alright degenerates, gather 'round while I tell you about FutureFuel Corp (NYSE: FF), a company that makes biodiesel and some chemical stuff I don't understand. They're based in Missouri, which is already a red flag because nothing good comes from Missouri except cheap beer.

What they do:

* Chemicals (the good stuff that actually makes money)
* Biodiesel (the stuff that's currently losing money faster than me at a casino)

Management: Some dude named Roeland Polet took over as CEO in Jan 2024. This guy is actually legit - 35+ years running chemical companies at DSM, Valspar, and Celanese. He's not some MBA moron; he actually knows chemistry and is laser-focused on ditching the biodiesel BS for high-margin chemicals. Insiders own 41% of this dumpster fire, so at least they're eating their own cooking.

# The Numbers (Warning: May Cause Depression)

Listen up smooth brains, the financials are uglier than my portfolio after discovering options:

2024: Revenue down 34% to $243M. That's like losing a third of your Wendy's paycheck.

Q1 2025: HOLY MOTHER OF LOSSES. Revenue crashed 70% to $17.5M. They lost $17.6M. That's right, they literally set money on fire. Why? Because winter happened and apparently nobody at this company has heard of weather forecasts.

The Good(??):

* ZERO DEBT (even I have more debt than this company)
* $97M cash on hand (that's like 97 million McChickens)
* 🚨 HOLY SHIT THEY PAY DIVIDENDS 🚨 - 5.6% yield! That's right, this dumpster fire STILL PAYS YOU $0.24/share annually while losing money. That's like your wife's boyfriend giving you an allowance while banging your wife. ABSOLUTE CHAD MOVE.

# Current Price Action (Spoiler: It's Bad)

Trading at $4.28 as of July 25, 2025. Market cap \~$187M.

Here's the kicker - their enterprise value is only $87M because they have so much cash. That means the market thinks their actual business is worth less than a decent yacht.

P/E ratio is NEGATIVE because they lost money over the last 12 months. Trailing twelve-month P/E is about -28.5, which basically means ""don't use P/E here unless you like getting rugged."" Price to book is 0.95x, which means you're basically buying a dollar for 95 cents, assuming management doesn't light that dollar on fire (which they might).

# 🎯 THE DIVIDEND SITUATION (PAY ATTENTION YOU DEGENS) 🎯

Let me spell this out for you crayon eaters:

* Current Yield: 5.6% (That's $0.24 per share annually)
* They're STILL PAYING IT despite losing money
* Quarterly payments (every 3 months you get tendies)
* At $4.28/share, every 100 shares = $24/year = 6 McChickens per quarter

This is like finding a sugar daddy who's ugly but still gives you an allowance. Yeah they're not pretty, but that dividend hits different when everything else in your portfolio is red.

# The Bull Case (Copium Alert 🚨)

1. 💵 DIVIDEND PRINTER GO BRRR: 5.6% yield baby! While your growth stocks are down 50%, this bad boy is literally paying you to hold their bags. $0.24 per share annually. That's better than your savings account, your girlfriend's OF tips, and definitely better than the 0% yield on your GME shares.
2. New Chemical Capacity: They're building new chemical plants that should come online late summer 2025. Chemicals = good margins = tendies = MORE DIVIDENDS.
3. Government Welfare (45Z Tax Credit): The government might throw them some money through this new Clean Fuel Production Credit. They shut down biodiesel production because they're waiting to see how much Uncle Sam will pay them. Smart or retarded? You decide.
4. Cash Money: With $97M in cash and no debt, they could buy something that doesn't suck or just KEEP PAYING THAT SWEET DIVIDEND until the heat death of the universe.
5. Insider Buying: CEO and some director bought 10k shares each at \~$4. Either they know something or they want those dividends too.

# The Bear Case (Already Priced In, Don't Be a 🌈🐻)

1. They Make BIODIESEL: Yeah, in 2025 with EVs. But they're literally pivoting to chemicals RIGHT NOW. The biodiesel is just bonus money when 45Z hits.
2. Weather Broke Their Plant: One-time event that already happened. They fixed it and learned. Lightning doesn't strike twice (unless you're my portfolio).
3. Class Action Lawsuit: Some ambulance chasers crying about ""material weaknesses."" Stock dropped 8.6% when announced and recovered. ALREADY IN THE PRICE.
4. Revenue Down 70%: Because they CHOSE to idle production waiting for better margins. That's called discipline, not disaster.
5. Zero Analyst Coverage: Good. We get to buy before the suits figure it out and upgrade.

# The Verdict (Not Financial Advice, I'm Literally Eating Glue)

This is either: A) A deep value DIVIDEND play where you're getting PAID 5.6% to own $2.22 in cash per share plus a business for basically free B) A value trap that at least pays you while teaching you why cheap stocks are cheap

THE DIVIDEND IS REAL AND IT'S SPECTACULAR. While your tech stocks are giving you nothing but pain, this biodiesel boomer is dropping $0.24/share into your account like clockwork. That 5.6% yield is better than:

* Your savings account (0.5%)
* Treasury bonds (boring)
* Your wife's boyfriend's tips (inconsistent)
* That girl from Tinder who ""just needs gas money""

The pivot to chemicals could work if they don't accidentally blow up the new plant. The 45Z credit might save biodiesel if politicians don't change their minds (lol).

My Position: 69.69 shares because funny numbers

Price Target: $8+ when catalysts hit (87% upside), $2 if they keep screwing up (50% downside). Risk/reward is actually good if you're not a paper-handed baby.

Risk Level: Somewhere between ""responsible 5% position"" and ""second mortgage""

FINAL DISCLAIMER: This is not financial advice. I failed high school math twice. I think P/E ratio stands for ""Penis Envy ratio."" I once bought WISH at $30. My investment strategy is based on which ticker symbols look coolest. If you take financial advice from someone who can't spell ""dividend"" without spellcheck, you deserve to lose money.

Do your own DD. Or don't. I'm not your mom.

TLDR: Deep value chemical play disguised as dying biodiesel company. PAYS 5.6% DIVIDEND to wait for catalysts. Trading below book value with $97M cash. New chemical plant + 45Z credits + competent CEO = potential double. Lawsuit already priced in. GET PAID TO WAIT FOR THE MOON. Not financial advice, am literally a golden retriever with a Robinhood account who thinks this is the buy of 2025.
I have been following your posts.......and WINNING...nah for real tho. I am in for a couple hundred. Your track record is pretty solid. If I could recommend posting more often, also post only stocks that will moon. But make sure your posts are early enough so I can make a lot of money. 

I am a lazy POS, myself, so if I am honest, I don't even read most of your post. I don't even copy and paste it into ChatGPT. I just buy. Thanks Good company that currently struggling and a great value play. Don’t forget about their special dividends which they do occasionally and just chuck a bunch of money at their investors. Followed your advice about CHRS and it's working well (Please have good ER next week). Gonna give FF a try again. in at 300 shares @ 4.18 exactly, its not often you can find a company with good growth potential and a good dividend payment

1mafahn,2025-07-27,"$NVNI Oracle might acquire Nuvini? Here’s why I think so...
I have been researching Nuvini Group extensively, but there is one aspect I still cannot fully understand.

Oracle has agreed to provide Nuvini with access to its global infrastructure. This would allow Nuvini to distribute its innovative AI tools worldwide and generate revenue without pursuing additional mergers or acquisitions. At first glance, this sounds like an ideal scenario for any entrepreneur a truly remarkable story.

However, Oracle operates **101 public cloud regions** (data centers) across at least **26 countries**, and its 2024 revenue reached **$53 billion**. Oracle is fiercely competing with AWS, Microsoft, and Google. So why would it extend such a significant benefit to a small Brazilian mid-sized company like Nuvini?

As for the AI tools Nuvini emphasizes performance ultimately depends on infrastructure and hardware. The claim that these tools can generate revenue within 50 days is notable, but Oracle certainly has the capability to develop similar technologies itself.

Let’s look at the facts. In 2024, Nuvini’s annual revenue was **1,767 times smaller** than Oracle’s. Oracle generates what Nuvini earns in an entire year in just **4.96 hours** not even a full day. So what real significance does granting Oracle’s global network to a company of this scale have?

This made me reflect on past examples.

Nuvini’s CEO, **Pierre Schurmann**, previously created and sold [**Zeeks.com**](http://Zeeks.com) and also founded and managed the VC firm **Bossa Invest**. In other words, he is highly experienced in building companies and executing successful exits. He once stated:  
**“The goal after an acquisition is to grow the company and achieve an exit through an IPO.”**  
This clearly indicates Nuvini’s strategy: to grow its subsidiaries strategically and recover investor capital through IPOs. The three companies highlighted at **Nuvini AI Day** already hold significant market share in their respective sectors—making them strong candidates for public listings.

Further investigation shows that Oracle invested **$8 million** in an incubation center, which is said to support the three products selected at Nuvini AI Day. Typically, such incubation centers provide:

1. Startup development support
2. Office space and infrastructure
3. Mentorship
4. Networking and partnership opportunities
5. Assistance with fundraising
6. Technology experimentation and proof-of-concept (POC) testing

On the surface, this appears to be corporate support for startups. However, in many cases, incubation programs ultimately lead to **equity investments or acquisitions**. Oracle already operates in 26 countries and has a cloud region in Brazil. This suggests that Nuvini’s revenue or local market share is not, by itself, a major factor for Oracle.

Therefore, the current partnership could likely be a **precursor to equity investment or acquisition**. That said, Schurmann’s **Class FF shares**, which grant him significant control, might reduce the immediate appeal of an acquisition. Still, it’s difficult to believe Oracle would provide global network access without a deeper strategic interest.

Another interesting point: Nuvini’s CEO and CFO recently accepted compensation in **stock instead of cash**, and at a **discounted price**. This can be interpreted in two ways:

* A move to reinforce investor confidence
* Or a strategic bet on a future stock price increase

The terms of insider convertible notes are also noteworthy. When Oracle engaged with Nuvini’s subsidiary **Data Hub** about using OCI back in 2024, it’s unclear whether future investment discussions were included. However, in November 2024, insider investment through convertible notes occurred. These insiders faced unfavorable terms compared to other investors conversion at **$1.10** or **principal +5%**, versus external investors earning returns tied to **SELIC +10% interest**.

Furthermore, Oracle’s relationship with Nuvini did not start recently it dates back to **2021**. This suggests a long-term strategic approach rather than a sudden partnership.

This situation invites multiple interpretations:

* Is Oracle aiming to strengthen OCI adoption as part of a broader LATAM strategy with an eventual acquisition in mind?
* Is this simply a technology acquisition strategy through partnerships?
* Or is Oracle positioning itself as a strategic partner as Nuvini prepares for an IPO or spin-off to achieve an exit?

I look forward to diverse perspectives and deeper discussion on this.
[deleted] Oracle’s full support is an incredible advantage from Nuvini Group shareholders’ perspective, but from Oracle shareholders’ point of view, it’s hard to understand. As mentioned in the article, Nuvini’s annual revenue is less than what Oracle makes in just five hours. Allowing such a small company to leverage Oracle’s infrastructure might, perhaps, be a strategic move to lay the groundwork for future service migration. [deleted] They also have to get to $1 before October 13th. So if there's no partnership on the other hand, they'll struggle and possibly RS. I often set price targets on StocktOits, and my current target is **$1.40 by August 19**.  
However, please note that stock decisions should be based on individual judgment, so this is for reference only. There are risks even with discounted stocks.
And forecasts should be backed by your own reasoning. What do we think NVNI could climb to by end of July? And end of August? I’m new to this very interesting company - is it risky to buy it at 0,4799€ becous it was at 0,169€ not long ago

1ma4djn,2025-07-26,"$SPYR – Forgotten IoT Stock Trading at Millionths of a Penny
Not a pump. Just putting this on your radar.

SPYR ($SPYR) was a public company that pivoted into IoT by acquiring GeoTraq in 2022. They claimed to develop ultra-small tracking chips (Tracker-M, Sensor-M) designed for asset monitoring, supply chain, agriculture, etc.

But… the company went quiet. No updates in 2024–2025. Their old site now redirects, and shares have basically flatlined.

Here’s why it caught my attention:
	•	Trades at $0.000001 – yes, millionths of a penny
	•	Once traded above $1
	•	~300M–700M float, almost zero volume
	•	Potential meme setup: abandoned tech stock, zero liquidity, high upside if it comes back to life

I own 6,000 shares. Not financial advice. Just a lotto ticket at this point. But figured I’d share in case anyone wants to do a deeper dive or watchlist it for fun.

If this does anything, it’s likely driven by attention—not fundamentals.

DYOR. Be smart.
CEO’s profile on LinkedIn says the company was dissolved

https://preview.redd.it/4efyvsw95bff1.jpeg?width=1206&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5a7d0072499c545f630aa2b31d8a3a75d63468f5 That’s because the company was dissolved aka no longer exists. Op didn’t even do the bear minimum to advertise this stock. I am honestly blocking their account to eliminate any risk of them gaslighting me into something radioactive.  I’ll put 10 bucks in just to say fuck it lol This feels more like buying a losing lottery ticket that has already been scratched… website weirdly redirects to coinbase and they haven’t filed anything in years.  Just appears they went belly up and didn’t bother to cancel the shares or tell anyone Oh great! Lol that explains why everything is dark. Kinda funny that Coinbase bought their domain tho I can’t even find it 

Edit: (on any brokers) Lol I was just surprised to see this ticker mentioned at all! I traded it through fidelity a few years ago when the company was still actively doing things and active in the market

**""This relationship allows us to expand our business and incorporate tools that our companies wouldn't have been able to access as quickly on their own,"" Schurmann commented. He also stated that Oracle is already assisting with the technology migration of group companies, such as Onclick and Lead Lovers, to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), with a focus on cost reduction and** [**optimization.Oracle**](http://optimization.Oracle) **and Nuvini, a B2B SaaS acquisition company, have been expanding their strategic partnership with a focus on artificial intelligence and technological expansion. In an interview with** ***IT Inside*****, Pierre Schurmann, founder of Nuvini, and Guilherme Cavalcanti, senior sales director at Oracle, detailed the developments of this collaboration.This is huge news guys!!!!** 

**Vieira highlighted that Oracle has invested heavily in creating ecosystems, with a presence in hubs such as Cubo, Distrito, and Caldeira, as well as partnerships with companies like Meta and NVIDIA. He added that Nuvini is also expected to play an active role in the recently opened Oracle Innovation Center, which has invested R$40 million.**

**""We have a real expectation of placing Nuvini's solutions in our marketplace, expanding the presence of these companies not only in Brazil, but also in Latin America and the world,"" concluded the Oracle executive.**

During the conversation, Schurmann highlighted the importance of the flexibility offered by Oracle in enabling integration with different language models (LLMs), which is crucial for the diversity of solutions and markets served by the seven companies currently in Nuvini's portfolio. ""Oracle gives us the flexibility to choose and in which context to use each specific AI solution,"" he stated.

Guilherme Cavalcanti explained that the relationship between the two companies goes beyond the traditional client-supplier model. ""We serve technology companies as partners, focusing on knowledge, top-notch professionals, and joint go-to-market,"" he said. He also mentioned that the partnership resulted in the creation of *Nuvini AI Day*, an internal program in which multidisciplinary teams from the group's companies presented AI-based projects with the potential to become a product in just 50 days.

The company has indicated that they intend to use proceeds from recent public offerings to expand their commercial capabilities, accelerate expansion in the European Union, fund additional studies, and potentially submit the PreTRM test to the FDA for broad approval. 

They are expanding into different states such as NY by being approved for use by individual states health departments.

Financials: 

As of March they had a $46mil cash runway after a dilution earlier this year, no debt, and in June brought on a CCO to lead commercialization efforts.

Has a relatively low float at around 26 mil shares.

Revenue in Q1 was positive, $38,000.  Small, but should only go up for here

Stock has around 50% institutional ownership from what I can find.

1m900o8,2025-07-25,"$SVM : One of The Best Silver Play for 2025-2030
**Silvercorp Metals** is a mining company that specializes in extracting silver from its established operations in China and is developing a new copper-gold project called **El Domo**.

I know that silver’s reputation is less glamorous than gold, but you must know that it is critically important for a bunch of reasons. Here's why I am bullish on it for the future.

Solar panels, EVs, mobile phones, and 5G infrastructure **all rely on silver’s unique properties**.

For four consecutive years, the global silver market has undergone **years of supply deficits**, from 2021 through 2024, **totaling 678 million ounces of unmet demand**. This shortage exists partly because most silver is mined as a byproduct of other metals, making rapid supply increases difficult.

But at the same time, demand continues to surge. Solar-panel usage **has grown 158% since 2019**, and **modern panels require 50% more silver than earlier generations**. Electric vehicles require **50% more silver as conventional cars**, and the rollout of **5G networks and billions of connected devices further fuels consumption**.

In the fiscal year ending March 2025, Silvercorp reported **revenue of $298.9 million**, a **39% increase from the prior year’s $215.2 million**. The company generated **$58.2 million in net income**, translating to a **profit margin of 19.5%**, which is notable because many mining companies struggle to remain profitable.

Moreover, Silvercorp holds **$369 million in cash against just $112 million of debt**, giving it a net-cash position of $252 million. This means the company can fund its growth projects without issuing new shares or taking on burdensome debt.

Silvercorp’s **cost of producing an ounce of silver is $12.12**, while silver currently trades above **$35** **per ounce**. In other words, the company **earns over $20 of profit on each ounce it sells**. This places Silvercorp among the cheapest producers globally, ensuring healthy margins even if silver prices decreases.

Growth is centered around **two projects**. First, the **Ying District** in China **is being expanded, with throughput already exceeding its planned capacity**. 

Second, the **El Domo project** in Ecuador will **add copper and gold to the company’s output**, potentially **doubling silver-equivalent production by 2029**. Because Silvercorp’s cash exceeds El Domo’s $240.5 million price tag, **the project is fully funded, reducing execution risk**.

The company's price-to-earnings ratio of 16.4× and enterprise-value-to-EBITDA multiple of 5.5× are **roughly half or a third of competitors** like Hecla Mining and Pan American Silver, despite Silvercorp’s **stronger financial health and higher margins**. This means that the company is **undervalued** with their share price at $4.73.

In the future, if silver price stabilizes to around **$32-35 per ounce** and **on-time project execution**, this could drive the stock into the **$6.75–$7.98 range**, a 41–67% gain. In another scenario, if silver goes above **$40 per ounce**, this could lift the share price **above $10**.

Over five years, **if silver averages $45–55** and **El Domo reaches full production**, Silvercorp shares could trade **between $8.50 and $12.00**, realizing a **78–152% return**. In the last scenario where it's less probable, should silver surge to **$75–88** per ounce in a true supercycle, the stock might ascend into the **$25–$35 territory**, delivering returns of more than 400%.

However, though I am bullish in this company, there are still some risks that you should know.

If China policy shifts or geopolitical tensions rise, this could affect the company's operations, though Silvercorp’s Chinese licenses run through 2035 and local partnerships are strong.

Another risk is a sharp commodity downturn which would lower revenues, but the company’s low cost structure provides a buffer even if silver fell below $20 per ounce. Project delays or cost overruns at El Domo are possible, but management has deep mining experience and ample cash to mitigate this risk.

As for the CEO and founder of the company, Dr. Rui Feng holds a PhD in geology and owns **3% of the shares**. Under him, the company has grown with **no equity dilution in 15 years**.

  
Always do your own DD.
I'm in with 500 shares well said.  I think this is one of the best run silver miners in the industry.  I think their expansion plans to various geographies and metals will drive this much higher.   and, dont forget about their 28% stake in New Pacific Metals which has huge potential.

1m8uqmh,2025-07-25,"🚨**SUNHYDROGEN ($HYSR) – THE MOST UNDERRATED GREEN TECH STOCK OUT THERE!**☀️💧
Guys, if you’re sleeping on SunHydrogen, you’re sleeping on the FUTURE. $HYSR is developing a game-changing technology that produces green hydrogen directly from sunlight and any water source. No electricity, no emissions – just cheap, clean hydrogen powered by nature itself. 🌍⚡

They’re not just talking – they’re building. Their panel tech uses photoelectrosynthetic nanoparticles that literally mimic photosynthesis on a microscopic level. We’re talking nature-level innovation, built for industrial-scale use: fertilizers, oil refining, fuel cells, even data centers. Oh, and the only byproduct? Pure oxygen. 🍃

On top of that, they’re working with CTF Solar to commercialize thin-film solar hydrogen modules. This isn’t sci-fi. This is bleeding-edge cleantech that’s moving fast and still trades like a microcap.

🚀 If SunHydrogen delivers even a fraction of what they’re building, this could be one of the biggest green energy breakouts of the decade.

🌞 Hydrogen. From sunlight. With zero emissions. $HYSR is NOT just a penny stock – it’s a moon ticket.

DYOR, but I’m loading up.

1m8ue96,2025-07-25,"Nobody’s watching this uranium microcap – but they hold a Tier-1 U.S. asset
Ticker: MET1.L (Metals One Plc) GBp
	•	<£10M market cap
	•	U.S.-based uranium project in a proven, high-grade district
	•	Also holds nickel/cobalt assets in Finland & Norway
	•	Zero retail attention – no hype, no crowd
	•	Still trading under 20p

This might be the cleanest way to front-run the next uranium wave before it hits Twitter.

I’m building a position. DYOR.

I found they have zero revenue and burn close to $2m per year? Do you have information on their Cashflow? Fair point – they are pre-revenue and burn ~£2M/year, which is a valid risk.

What I find interesting (and maybe worth discussing) is:
	•	They hold a uranium asset in the U.S. with historical production
	•	Still trading at a microcap valuation (<£10M)
	•	No hype or promo around it – yet uranium sentiment is picking up

Definitely early stage, definitely high risk – but maybe also underappreciated?

Curious what others think. Is this kind of setup too speculative, or worth keeping on radar?

This clinical trial is advancing at a very fast pace. The study completion for Phase 1b could happen anytime now. In other words, this means that we could see news very soon.

$KSS

Kohl’s Corp. is a well-established retail giant known for its wide range of apparel, footwear, and home products. Recently, Kohl’s has been focusing on revitalizing its business through expanding partnerships, enhancing its online presence, and improving customer loyalty programs. Financially, Kohl’s has shown steady improvements with better-than-expected earnings and efforts to reduce debt. They’ve also been exploring innovative ways to drive store traffic, including new product lines and collaborations. Despite challenges from the broader retail environment and competition from both online and brick-and-mortar stores, Kohl’s remains a key player with a solid footprint across the U.S. The company’s upcoming quarterly results and holiday season performance will be crucial in determining if the turnaround strategy is working effectively.

That said, it’s still a clinical-stage biotech, so most of the value hinges on how trials go and whether they get regulatory approvals. There’s definitely potential, but it's still a speculative play for now.

$MBOT

Microbot Medical Inc is a post clinical stage medical device company featuring their LIBERTY® Endovascular Robotic System. Their robotic system has already passed all clinical trials with 100% success rate and reduced radiation by 92% which is groundbreaking in the healthcare industry. Their product already has 9 global patents including 1 in China, where the endovascular demand is surging. Liberty's founding team consists of professionals in robotics and in medical devices. The next step is FDA approval to sell in the U.S. Once this happens, they will be able to start producing these machines and selling them to hospitals.

$OPEN

Opendoor Technologies Inc. has been grabbing headlines as it pushes to shake up the traditional real estate market. The company’s business model—buying homes directly from sellers, renovating them, and then reselling—has had its ups and downs, but it’s trying to find out a new way for people to buy and sell homes faster. The stock has seen a rollercoaster ride, partly because of market volatility and changing home prices, but Opendoor keeps innovating. They’re expanding their footprint in more cities and improving their tech platform to make the process smoother and less stressful for customers. Despite some challenges like tight housing inventory and fluctuating interest rates, Opendoor’s focus on streamlining real estate transactions and providing instant offers has helped it stay relevant. They’re also investing in data and AI tools to better price homes and speed up sales. With a big market still to capture and the housing market constantly evolving, Opendoor’s growth story is still very much a work in progress. The next few quarters will be key to see if they can turn their concept into consistent profits.

$DNUT

Krispy Kreme Inc. has been getting a bit of attention lately after its stock price jumped. Part of the hype comes from it being added to some small-cap indexes and some meme stock traders jumping in. The company had a rough patch earlier this year, dealing with a cybersecurity issue and putting the brakes on its McDonald’s expansion pilot. But they’ve bounced back since. They’ve been running some clever promotions too, like their 88-cent dozen deal for their 88th birthday and a new collaboration with Warner Bros. called “Hungry for Heroes.” These moves keep the brand fresh, even though it’s not in the hot tech or biotech space. What’s really interesting is that Krispy Kreme keeps growing steadily worldwide. Their partnerships with big retailers like Costco and Tesco are helping with that. Even if the recent stock rise seems more about hype than strong financials, the company has managed 18 straight quarters of same-store sales growth, which is impressive. With a refreshed leadership team and another earnings report coming up, $DNUT might keep its momentum going—especially if it stays connected with its customers and relevant in pop culture.

1m8bfl0,2025-07-24,"⚠️ $FOXO legal filings raise red flags — worth a closer look for anyone holding
I’ve been reviewing recent SEC filings and court records related to FOXO Technologies Inc. ($FOXO), and there are several legal and financial developments worth noting:

🔹 Multiple lawsuits are active — including cases from parties like Smithline, Kersch, and Nash involving alleged defaults on convertible notes.

🔹 Senior PIK noteholders are also pursuing claims, and it appears FOXO is working to convert those obligations into equity under a Series B plan.

🔹 A judgment was entered in a royalty-related dispute (possibly involving Illumina), with settlement discussions still ongoing.

🔹 An SEC investigation into prior management changes was recently closed with no action taken, but a shareholder-focused probe by investor law firms remains open and active.

Additionally, FOXO has completed several reverse stock splits, issued preferred stock, and raised funds to support operations. These actions may significantly impact capital structure and existing shareholders.

This is not financial advice — just sharing publicly available information for anyone researching the company. Definitely worth reviewing the latest filings and court updates if you're tracking this ticker.

1m89ywj,2025-07-24,"SOUN—The Voice in Your Head, The Shorts on Your Back (Short Squeeze + Fundamentals)

TL;DR (for the ADHD apes):
	•	Short interest: ~119.7M shares short, ~33% of the float, ~3.3–3.5 days to cover, borrow rate ~1.5%.  ￼ ￼
	•	Fundamentals actually improving: Q1 2025 revenue $29.1M (+151% YoY), $246M cash, zero debt.  ￼
	•	Massive contract backlog: Company cites $1.2B bookings backlog for 2024, and other reports peg booked sales/backlog at ~$682M, +80% YoY—long runway, recurring revenue model.  ￼ ￼
	•	Real customers, real scale: Voice AI in 10,000+ restaurant locations (Chipotle, Jersey Mike’s, White Castle, Church’s Texas Chicken, etc.) plus big auto OEMs (Hyundai, Kia, Stellantis, Harman).  ￼ ￼ ￼
	•	Nvidia drama: NVDA disclosed a stake in early 2024, then reportedly exited in Q4 2024. Shorts seized on that, but the business didn’t vanish—reacceleration in 2025 is on deck.  ￼ ￼ ￼

⸻

The Setup: “You can’t hear me? That’s cuz your ears are shorted shut.”

Price check (July 23, 2025 close): ~$12.20, market cap ~$4.55B, 401.4M shares outstanding.  ￼

Shorts still crowding the party: 119.66M shares short = 33.1% of float; days-to-cover hovering ~3.3–3.5. That’s not GME ‘21 crazy, but it’s enough to create a squeeze if volume dries up for even a couple days or a catalyst hits.  ￼ ￼

Borrow fee is only ~1.5%, which tells you shorts feel comfy. They’re betting on dilution, losses, or a miss. Complacent shorts + improving fundamentals = time to kick the stool.  ￼

⸻

Why Shorts Are Here (and Why They’re Wrong)
	1.	“They never file on time / accounting risk.” SOUN delayed its 10-K in March, stock dipped ~6% on that headline. Shorts love compliance FUD. Filing delay ≠ cooked books, and the Q1 print came in strong.  ￼
	2.	“NVDA dumped them. The AI daddy left.” Nvidia’s 13F in Q4 2024 shows they exited SOUN. Shorts said “game over”—but Nvidia trimming tiny equity stakes is portfolio housekeeping, not a verdict on SoundHound’s biz. The company itself didn’t lose major customers.  ￼ ￼
	3.	“They’re unprofitable, so who cares?” True, not sustainably profitable yet (GAAP swings positive due to non-cash warrant revaluation; core operations still negative). But revenue growth + large committed backlog + thick gross margin profile = line of sight to operating leverage.  ￼ ￼

⸻

Fundamentals: This Isn’t Just a Meme

Q1 2025 numbers:
	•	Revenue: $29.1M (+151% YoY)—hyper-growth in a rough macro.  ￼
	•	Cash & equivalents: $246M (no debt)—runway to scale without immediate dilution.  ￼
	•	Operating cash burn Q1: ~$19.2M vs $21.9M prior year—burn narrowing as revenue ramps.  ￼
	•	Balance sheet confirms $245.8M cash as of 3/31/25.  ￼

Bookings/Backlog = Visibility:
	•	$1.2B bookings backlog (FY 2024) cited by Investor’s Business Daily—this isn’t pipeline fluff, it’s contracted revenue to be recognized.  ￼
	•	Another report cites $682M booked sales backlog (+80% YoY)—definitions differ (bookings vs contracted backlog), but both indicate a huge multi-year ramp.  ￼

Sectors they dominate:
	•	Restaurants/QSR: 10k+ locations (drive-thru, phone, kiosks). Chipotle, Jersey Mike’s, White Castle, Church’s, Torchy’s Tacos, etc.—those are real logos with repeat orders.  ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼
	•	Auto OEMs: Hyundai, Kia, Stellantis, Harman—embedded voice assistants in cars = multi-year, high-margin royalties.  ￼
	•	SYNQ3 acquisition: $25M deal (late 2023) to consolidate the QSR voice market. Scale matters in AI data loops.  ￼ ￼

⸻

The Squeeze Math:
	•	Short interest: 119.66M shares.  ￼
	•	Float short %: ~33%.  ￼ ￼
	•	Days to cover: 3.3–3.5. One or two big up-volume days + a liquidity vacuum can force covering.  ￼ ￼
	•	Borrow fee: ~1.54% now—low cost = easy to hold, but if news spikes and locates tighten, borrow fee explodes and shorts get margin-called.  ￼

If price rips 30–40% on a headline (new auto deal, TAM update, or a restaurant chain expansion) and volume dries up, shorts need multiple days to exit. That’s conditions for a face-melter.

⸻

Catalysts (Choose Your Flavor of Boom):
	1.	More contract wins / expansions: They’re already in 10k+ restaurants—land & expand is baked in. Any new large chain (think McD, Starbucks, Yum! Brands) would be a nuke.  ￼
	2.	Auto OEM production cycles: New car model years roll in H2. If Stellantis/Hyundai push SoundHound’s AI more prominently, that’s fast royalty growth.  ￼
	3.	Agentic AI hype: IBD called out “agentic AI push”—SoundHound’s conversational agents that follow multi-step logic. The market is looking for “AI beyond text/chatbots” right now.  ￼
	4.	Backlog conversion: As those $100Ms of backlog start hitting the P&L, revenue comps stay triple-digit. Shorts can’t keep calling it a “story stock” when the story turns into cash.  ￼ ￼
	5.	Margin & cash flow inflection: Operating losses narrowing; any guidance toward breakeven will make algos chase profitability momentum.  ￼
	6.	Analyst upgrades/price target hikes: Fool and Yahoo pieces are already priming retail; a major bank initiation on “Buy” could pour gas on it.  ￼ ￼ ￼

⸻

Bear Case / Risk Rundown (because we’re not totally brain dead):
	•	Execution risk: Converting backlog is not trivial—implementation delays could push rev out, spooking bulls.  ￼
	•	Profitability still out of reach: They’re not GAAP profitable in core ops. Any capital raise chatter will cause dips.  ￼
	•	NVDA exit optics: Shorts weaponize the headline “Nvidia dumped them.” If the crowd thinks “NVDA left = loser,” multiple compression could persist.  ￼ ￼
	•	Competition: Amazon, Google, and OpenAI could decide to muscle into B2B voice AI at scale. SoundHound’s niche moat is data+vertical specialization—but giants are always a threat. (Inference based on industry context; no direct citation provided because competitive risk is general knowledge.)
	•	Macro and rate risk: Risk-free at 4.35% means high-growth names still get discounted aggressively on any Fed hawkish surprise.  ￼

⸻

Positioning / How I’m Playing It
	•	Core shares for the fundamentals: Let the backlog, revenue, and TAM realization play out through 2026.
	•	Call spreads to ride squeeze windows: E.g., buy near-the-money calls 2–3 months out and finance by selling OTM calls above the potential squeeze pop. (Not financial advice, just how I’d scalp gamma during a squeeze window.)
	•	Hedges: If you’re levered long, consider cheap puts when IV is low—sound risk management is not paper-handed, it’s just adulting.

⸻

The Meme Angle (Because WSB Needs Memes)
	•	“SoundHound to the Moon” = Solana dogs are out; it’s time for AI hounds.
	•	“SOUN shorts: Can’t hear you over the sound of my tendies.”
	•	“They said ‘streaming audio’ was dead, so we bought the company that sells the audio brain.”
	•	Post your gains, post your losses. If we crash, I’m gonna blame NVDA’s 13F and you can blame me. Circle of life.

⸻

Closing Thought

You want a squeeze? You need two ingredients: fuel (high short %) + spark (real catalysts). SOUN has both. Shorts are pricing in “overhyped AI toy.” But there’s a real business under the hood—10k+ locations, multi-year auto deals, $1.2B bookings, and a war chest of cash with no debt. That’s a fundamentally improving equity with a structurally dangerous short position.  ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼

Now excuse me while I go practice talking to my microwave—SOUN is about to give it a voice.

⸻

Not financial advice. I eat crayons, not caviar. 🖍️💎👐

⸻

Obi loves this stock too A lot of passion in your post, a lot to write, but I hear ya. Was in for over a year, had a position at $4, sold right after new year around $13. Been wanting to buy back in, but been waiting for around $8, may never see that again, but I stick to my guns, been burned a few times on FOMO, so I'll watch and wait until my price target. If my OPTT calls hit I'm in

1m844zn,2025-07-24,"$FOXO history of stock split surges
Alright, /r/pennystocks. We often discuss micro-cap plays, and I've been digging into $FOXO (FOXO Technologies Inc.). This isn't about chasing the next AI behemoth; it's a company in healthcare services and technology, undergoing some notable internal changes.

Quick TLDR: FOXO has gone up like significantly past two stock splits ($0.2->$1.2) 

Ticker: $FOXO (NYSE American)
This company operates at a tiny market cap (~$2.7M - $3.1M) and has been active with corporate actions.

What Does FOXO Do?
FOXO Technologies operates across two main segments:
 * Healthcare: This includes owning and operating a critical access hospital (Scott County Community Hospital) and a behavioral health facility (Myrtle Recovery Centers).
 * Labs and Life (Epigenetics): This segment focuses on applying AI and machine learning to discover epigenetic biomarkers from saliva, primarily for health, wellness, and risk assessment in areas like the life insurance industry.
They recently announced an intention to spin off their Epigenetics subsidiary, which could be a strategic move to unlock value or focus operations.
Recent Corporate Actions & Observations
FOXO has seen significant corporate restructuring:
 * Recent Reverse Splits: They completed a 1:10 reverse split in April 2025 and have another 1:1.99 reverse split effective July 27, 2025 (trading split-adjusted July 28, 2025).
 * Listing Compliance: The 1:1.99 ratio, while seemingly small, is explicitly stated as being for NYSE American listing compliance (to stay above $0.10). This indicates a focus on maintaining their exchange presence.
 * Historical Price Action Pre-Splits: Historically, prior to previous stock splits, FOXO's stock has demonstrated periods of significant upward price movement. This is an observable pattern, but historical performance does not guarantee future results.
 * Low Share Float: The company's float is relatively limited, which can sometimes contribute to volatility on news or increased trading volume.
Why It Might Be On Your Radar (for Discussion)
 * Spin-off Potential: The announced spin-off of the epigenetics subsidiary could create two distinct entities, potentially allowing investors to value each business more clearly.
 * Historical Volatility: The past pattern of price movements around splits is an interesting data point, though purely historical.
 * Very Low Market Cap: At its current valuation, any substantial positive development could have a magnified impact on percentage gains.
 * Healthcare + Biotech Narrative: The combination of traditional healthcare services with cutting-edge epigenetics and AI could appeal to different investor groups if the story gains traction.
Degenerate DD Summary (for Discussion Only)
 * ✅ Diversified (for a micro-cap): Healthcare operations + a planned biotech spin-off.
 * ✅ Corporate Restructuring: Recent reverse splits and a spin-off signal active management.
 * ✅ Low Float: Can lead to amplified price movements (both up and down).
 * ✅ Historical Context: Past price action around splits is a noteworthy pattern.
 
This is a low float stock split history play.

^(if) ^(you) ^(have) ^(any) ^(questions) ^(or) ^(concerns.) Are you suggesting buying now, right before a reverse split? Is that a good thing to do? I have 500 shares, you mean in 2 days, it'll only be 50 shares?! Foxo is a scam stock stay away. You will lose your money 4 days later, what is the consensus on the price?  No movement at other downward Not a bad call at all in retrospect Yes I want to revise my statement, according to FOXO's website, they posted the split would be a 1:1.99 split. So I would have about 250 shares? But on RH the FOXO ticker reads that it is no longer supported, and all my 500 stocks are gone. On the company website it did state that they were gonna operate under a new ticker maybe but im not a professional on this stuff and im very confused about what's happening.
 
The company website stated that the new stock was valued at $25/share! But that the company is the only one able to trade the shares atm, to raise funds for their new acquisition company expenditures FOXO Acquisition Company.

Does anyone know what's going on? Or when they think the company will release shares back to the public? Cuz heck $25/ share I'd sell right now 😂, bought these suckers at $.1267/ share. Below is the written press release  directly from their website. I'm very confused about this all. I'm very new to the investing game

https://www.foxotechnologies.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/74/foxo-technologies-inc-designates-new-series-of-preferred-stock-to-be-used-for-acquisitions It probably is, but I'm not too deep into it, just $63 of my total $1k that i have to invest. I dont think  i mind playing risky with that $63. I bought these at .1267/share, but somehow i'm already down -$2.82, with the share price hanging at just under .25/share. How can I already be negative, if the price has gone up from my initial position? I do like this learning opportunity though!

1m7n5u7,2025-07-23,"$NTCPF about to go to the stratosphere? 6-12 months if your patient enough.
After a beautiful presentation today Northisle Copper and Gold offered some great insight on their project.

Sam Lee, the CEO of the company mentioned multiple times how they are “second to none” in multiple categories. 

NPV, IRR, mine life, capital expenditure, and pay back period. (I may be missing some here but this is what I noticed)

With spot prices of gold at $2900 and copper at $4.80
(Significantly below what their market value is right now) this project has a $5 billion (CAD) NPV with an IRR of 45%. And this is based on the areas they have already explored with conservative spot prices. The capital expenditure is very low and the pay back period is less than 2 years which is unheard of in the junior mining sector. 

Imagine if they used spot prices of $5.75 copper and $3,400 for gold. 

Imagine if they included the other areas they have explored but left out like West Goodspeed.

The Northisle team believe they have the largest copper and gold mine system in the world that is “not currently” owned by a major mining company. Is this a *hint hint*??

What about the jurisdiction they’re in? Are they in a mine friendly area? 

Well of course they are. In fact they were 1 of 18 mines in British Columbia that has been identified as a critical metals project. And they are in the talks of being one of the first 4 mines that gets priority of the 18 to begin. 

They also just announced a deal with Wheaton precious metals company (ticker: $WPM) for $5 million (CAD) and the deal is set to close August 8th. Get ready for some big price movement around this time. 

Funding from Wheaton shows validation from a major streaming company. Now all we’re waiting for is a strategic partnership. 

Also did I mention the potential “multi generational” mine at pemberton. 

They already have a 29 year mine life right now with the areas they have already fully explored, excluding pemberton. Pemberton can possibly add an additional 60 years of mine life. 

Ps: I called this company out weeks ago and it’s already up over 10% since I mentioned it. Plenty of upside left.
After looking through the details of their project, I can see a $2 share price by the end of the year! If they go up to 287 million outstanding shares after the funding arrangement, they would be a little over half a billion in market cap! I’m diamond handing my shares and I’m buying more! Good DD as well I got in last week too. Great write up on a company ready to find it's legs. Will keep adding 🔥🔥🔥 This one is overlooked. Good long term play for the next 2-4 years. This is a legit multi bagger. The more I research about this project, the less risky it seems. I’ve trimmed some positions and might even fully close some tomorrow to buy more NTCPF. It’s slowly turning into my most anticipated stock. Thanks for sharing this. Pretty obvious we’re in a commodity bull run and a copper/gold play seems solid. Where to buy these penny stocks? Why did the price drop today? Any news? Also when can we expect any catalyst? I’m glad I saw your post a few weeks ago. I got in and have bought more since you mentioned this. They look like a top tier junior mining company thats going to blow up soon. Gotcha thanks! Any idea what effect tariff will have long term on stock price? Short term negative but long term I’m very bullish on gold and copper. Their copper portion of the project doesn’t begin until 5 years after they begin production (the gold portion is first).

1m7fuat,2025-07-23,"The Protein-Pivot Cycle Needs Its Pop: Why I’m Betting on NVAX (Squeeze)
[DD]

Alright degenerates, gather - up. OPEN exploded, KSS followed, and every meme/value/squeeze loop comes in threes. The last chair still doesn’t have an ape on it, so who steps up?

Ticker: NVAX — Novavax, Inc.

⸻

The Setup: “mRNA Fatigue? Meet the Protein Shot”

Current Price: $7.22
Market Cap: $1.17 B
My Target: $15-24

Trading like it’s one FDA rejection from Chapter 11—even after full approval and a Sanofi lifeline. Show me another commercial-stage biotech with 34 % of the float short and cash for two years.

⸻

The Valuation Gap Is Dumb

Company	EV/EBITDA*	EV/Sales*	Context
NVAX (2025 guide)	<2×	1.1×	Pricing in a slow death
Moderna	n/a	1.6×	mRNA pioneer, revenues falling
BioNTech	n/a	4.1×	Still trades like 2021
*NVAX EV $1.08 B  vs. 2025 revenue guide $975 M-$1.03 B			

A profitable, cash-rich vaccine maker at one-quarter of BNTX’s multiple? C’mon.

⸻

The Short-Interest Keg of Gunpowder
	•	46.6 M shares short = 34 % of float
	•	Days-to-cover: 9.1
	•	Borrow fee: 0.56 % — cheap, so shorts got comfy
	•	July 17 call blitz: 20,661 contracts lit up at $7.5-$10 strikes

Low fee + high concentration = the perfect complacency trade. One upside surprise and market makers have to buy shares against all that cheap delta.

⸻

The Bear Cases Are All Weak
	•	“COVID is dead.” Yet the CDC still recommends annual boosters for >65 and high-risk groups; NVAX now has the only non-mRNA option .
	•	“No cash.” Net cash ≈ $0.7 B after Q1, plus $175 M Sanofi milestone already wired .
	•	“Pipeline is empty.” Phase 3 combo flu-COVID read-out showed solid immune response, no new safety issues . RSV-adult and shingles pre-clinicals in 2026 road map.
	•	“Everyone hates needles now.” Protein adjuvant had lower reactogenicity than Pfizer in head-to-head SHIELD study .

⸻

Three Ways This Plays Out

Start: $7.22 / $1.17 B

Scenario	Multiple	Target	Return
Nothing Burger — combo slips	EV/Sales 0.8×	$6	–17 %
Base Case — combo launch + booster season	EV/Sales 1.5×	$12	+66 %
Squeeze-n-Shine — shorts bail, revenue top-end	EV/Sales 2.5×	$24	+230 %

Even the meh case barely hurts; the top two roast shorts alive.

⸻

Why the Setup Is Perfect

✓ Meme-able ticker (“N-VAX your puts”)
✓ Sub-$10 share price = YOLO fuel
✓ 34 % short float & 9 DTC
✓ Cash runway + Sanofi distribution muscle
✓ Catalyst rich (combo data journal pub, CDC strain pick, fall booster launch)
✓ Options tape already screaming

⸻

Recent “Problems” Are Actually Bullish
	•	FDA post-marketing study? Came with full approval—standard formality, not a delay .
	•	Revenue spike mostly APA accounting? True, but guidance still ~1 B without counting Sanofi’s sales/royalties .
	•	Borrow fee tiny? Means funds are size-on and snoozing—more explosive unwind.

⸻

But I Need the Hive-Mind

I’m loading NVAX because:
	•	Dirt-cheap vs peers
	•	Cash + partner de-risks burn
	•	Short float powder keg
	•	Fall 2025 booster season is 10 weeks away

Think you’ve got a cleaner 7:1 risk/reward under $2 B market-cap with fat short interest and near-dated catalysts? Drop it below.

⸻

Someone’s Already Loading — Check the Flow

Call volume on 7/17 was 25× average; $10 October strikes were pounded all day . Institutions don’t slam OTM calls on a $1 B cap stock for fun.

⸻

TL;DR NVAX is the protein-shot Cinderella left outside the meme ball. Full FDA approval, Sanofi royalties, Phase 3 combo data and a 34 % short float make this the ripest squeeze/value play on the board. I’m in. Do your own DD, don’t YOLO mortgage money, and may your tendies be crispy.
It’s the correct choice.

1m7b5hj,2025-07-23,"Direct from BioLargo CEO: Why This $55M Market Cap Stock is Poised for Breakout — A Must-Read for Pennystock Investors
OP

Hey everyone, Julian Jakobi here—some of you know me from Reddit as one of BioLargo's largest individual shareholders. Today, I'm bringing you something truly special: 

**not just my perspective, but the direct words from BioLargo's CEO** as presented in the latest shareholder letter and press release.

This is a rare opportunity to get a first-hand look at the ambitions, progress, and outlook directly from the company’s leadership—unedited, unfiltered, and straight from the top. I encourage everyone to pay close attention to the details and the vision shared below. Please keep this in mind as you read: **BioLargo is currently valued at less than $55 million—yes, the entire company.** In my opinion, that is one of the most compelling deep value and asymmetric opportunities on the entire market right now.

Add to this the recent market event: following the passing of a retired board member, we’re seeing 5 million shares becoming liquidated and hitting the open market. Short-term volatility is occurring, but the long-term fundamentals and the company’s multi-pronged growth strategy are stronger than ever.

**This is not just my bullish view. These are the CEO’s words.** No hype, just pure company insight. If you ever wondered what the leadership is thinking and what’s truly happening behind the scenes at BioLargo, read on carefully.

**Now, here’s the full letter to shareholders from President & CEO Dennis P. Calvert.**

  
**BioLargo Provides Review of 2025 Accomplishments and Insights for Coming Year**

https://preview.redd.it/7rsk5t9zxmef1.png?width=1952&format=png&auto=webp&s=11b6c7ffb2536df7524fa1884f46c4226275c48e

**Topic: Company Update**

***Letter to stockholders***

**Read the letter to stockholders from Mr. Calvert below:**

*Dear Valued Stockholders,*

*As we advance into the second half of 2025, we extend our heartfelt thanks for your continued support and belief in BioLargo's mission to create breakthrough solutions for a greater good while building value for our stockholders. This year, we are witnessing the culmination of years of strategic investment and R&D, with several of our business units approaching inflection points in the commercialization of the technology they were formed to develop and implement. We are pleased to provide a review of each subsidiary's primary area of focus and share highlights of our company's work to shape the future and drive value for its stakeholders.*

*In each case, it is important to remember that our investments in these technologies and companies have allowed us to develop a combination of validated technical claims and product features that we believe are unmatched in the marketplace. While they have inherent value, we know that to maximize our return on investment, we must advance them into commercial adoption and prove their market value in generating sales and profits. We have not wavered from this mission, and as a result have achieved a critical mass of financial resources, technical validations, product designs, and a highly qualified team to lead the charge forward. We firmly believe that the ""harvest will be realized"" as our pathway to generating substantial financial results is near at hand. Our low valuation creates a substantial buying opportunity that you should verify for yourself and is most certainly worth a deep dive. We will break each of our opportunities down in this letter, but we also highly encourage you to dig deeper, do your due diligence and know that we are fully committed to our success in realizing substantial value.*

***Clyra Medical - Entering the Next Stage of Commercialization***

*Our partially owned (52%) subsidiary Clyra Medical has invested years in research and development to create an unparalleled infection control and wound care product line that we believe will be transformative because of its performance and its patient-friendly, non-irritating formulation. We are confident that Clyra will make an impact for the greater good - the table is set, the mark is in sight, and we are marching towards the goal. How so?*

*In Q2, Clyra announced a series of sales and distribution agreements covering both U.S. and international markets. These agreements are expected to make Clyra's products available for purchase by 6,100 hospitals, 6,300 ambulatory surgery centers and 2,200 specialty wound care clinics in the U.S. alone. With unmatched performance claims, it is rewarding to see these innovations now reaching the healthcare settings where they can begin saving lives and improving clinical outcomes in ways not previously possible.*

*Highlights for Clyra Medical include:*

* *Platform technology - advanced wound irrigation - is FDA-cleared for broad clinical applications, including chronic wounds and surgical procedures, and first product, Viaclyr, headed to market through an established distributor, including internationally.*
* *A second product, developed for a specific distribution partner, is progressing through final regulatory and logistical processes in preparation of its product launch, for which Clyra has spent considerable resources establishing at-scale manufacturing capable of producing over one million units annually. While the details we provide are intentionally limited to protect any competitive advantages prior to launch, the evidence of our persistence, diligence, care, precision and substantial investments are in plain sight.*
* *Recent infusion of new capital of $3.3 million supports Clyra in its development efforts, scale operations, and to be prepared to meet demand.*
* *Clyra is developing additional products based on its FDA-approved platform technology, including wound gels, dental, nasal sprays, absorbent pads, negative pressure wound therapy, and aesthetic products.*

*Clyra continues to advance its selling propositions supporting future product-line expansion and opening doors to specialized vertical markets like military medicine and burn units.*

*Will it be worth the wait? To start, the market for Clyra's innovations is significant: according to the CDC, there are over 50 million inpatient surgical procedures annually, 6 million of which arise from chronic wound care. Clyra's products are highly differentiated and represent a potent solution for this significant market need. We have journeyed along this path for over a decade, invested our careers and substantial capital. We have survived when others fail. We have overcome an ""army"" of opposition. We now have leaders from industry with us, and Clyra is poised for massive success. Answer: ""YES"".*

***Battery Technology - Transforming Energy Storage***

*Cellinity, our revolutionary battery technology, continues to gain traction with prospective joint venture partners around the world that want to manufacture and supply batteries that store electricity for municipalities, data centers, EV charging stations, and other critical uses. We believe Cellinity can fill the global need for ""long duration energy storage"" batteries that can be better than lithium (and other technologies) by dispensing electricity over longer periods of time, having a longer useful lifespan without performance degradation, that can be sourced domestically without rare-earth elements and scarce minerals, and that have a better performance and safety profile.*

*How will we get Cellinity to market? Through a business model that preserves our cash, generates revenues long before first battery sales, empowers others to take financial risk, and provides diverse and ongoing revenue streams for our company. We quaintly describe our business model as ""sell factories, not batteries"". It contemplates a joint venture partner that hires BioLargo to engineer, design and build a factory to manufacture Cellinity batteries, licenses from BioLargo the right to make Cellinity batteries in exchange for an ongoing royalty on sales, contemplates BioLargo providing key components of the supply chain at a profit while retaining a 19% ownership of the joint venture entity formed to operate the factory.*

*This ""sell factories, not batteries"" business model has many benefits for our partners and for our company. It's a strategy that preserves our cash, while empowering our joint venture partners to create locally financed projects, local employment, local economic development, local high-tech jobs, energy resilience, and dramatic wealth creation. It empowers each partner to sell Cellinity into the particular industrial market of their choice, like data centers and EV charging stations. We believe this is a globally scalable model which can fill a gap in a market that* [*The Economist*](https://pr.report/ckgp)calls *""clean energy's next trillion dollar business"" (see* *Clean Energy's Next Trillion-Dollar Business*\*,\* *The Economist*\*, Sept 2024).\*

*In sum, we're commercializing a breakthrough battery technology that addresses a massive global demand, backed by a highly appealing business model - making this a venture with significant financial upside.*

*We've had several important successes in the past year in our mission to develop and commercialize Cellinity batteries:*

* *Built and tested prototype battery cells, verifying the technology's original claims of high energy density and voltage, capacity retention over many cycles, and safety (no runaway fire risk) when subjected to physical damage.*
* *Third-party validation of many of Cellinity battery cells' key advantages for use in grid-scale energy storage by U.S. BESS Corp, an expert provider of advanced energy storage solutions.*
* *Signed four memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with prospective joint venture partners interested in building and operating Cellinity battery factories as part of the company's business model to ""sell factories, not batteries"". These prospective JV partners as well as a growing list of prospects are highly varied, and include large industrial infrastructure developers, industrial real estate developers, data center developers, energy developers and even governments. For some, it's about economic development, benefits to local workforces, and grid and energy resiliency for their communities or constituents, and for some they're attracted to the potential financial upside.*

*The next step will be definitive contracts with our current prospective joint venture partners to start project development of the first factories, with us taking the role as project manager and engineer, generating revenue from the outset for these services. Each factory will cost over $100 million to build and will have the capacity to generate $500 million in revenue annually, and a handsome profit for all the parties involved for years to come.*

*Feedback from the market and potential joint venture partners reinforces our conviction that no other battery technology can match Cellinity's claim-set for grid-scale energy storage.*

*And, as we work to establish joint ventures to build factories, our engineers continue work advancing the battery technology and design to the container-sized grid-scale battery that will ultimately be sold to industrial users.*

*Is all this worth it? Consider: it starts with a great technology and a great team, continues with a capital-conserving strategy that shifts financial and operational risk to others, and ends with solving one the most pressing problems facing the planet in what is being called the ""next trillion-dollar business"". Economic incentives are robust in these areas and will play a key role in our success.*

*Answer: Yes, we know that we have a winner, and we target an enterprise value north of $2 billion. Time to get to work!*

***PFAS Treatment and other Water Treatment Technologies - From Pilot to Commercial Rollout***

*Our Aqueous Electrostatic Concentrator (AEC) technology removes per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from water, the ""forever chemicals"" now subject to regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. We're excited to give an update on our efforts to commercialize the technology and will continue to do so as more projects are secured.*

*With stricter state and federal mandates taking effect and the seemingly never-ending litigation against polluters, demand for reliable, cost-effective PFAS removal is steadily growing. Our technology is well positioned in this increasingly stringent regulatory environment because of its broad-spectrum capabilities (it captures all PFAS species tested), its low waste-byproduct production (waste increases costs and regulatory complications for operators), and its low operating costs compared to incumbent technologies like carbon filtration.*

*Our team has developed an integrated ""full-service"" water treatment package, combining AEC technology with engineering design, installation, destruction of PFAS, field testing and maintenance capabilities - offering clients a true turnkey solution that can generate revenue for BioLargo earlier in a project's lifespan.*

*Key progress this year includes:*

* *The company's first paid PFAS treatment project in New Jersey is well underway, with an AEC unit ready for installation and awaiting completion of construction of the treatment facility by the project's general contractor. Once installed, our team will deliver the AEC, complete installation and testing, and work with regulators to complete commissioning.*
* *Advancing the claims by running bench-scale pilot programs confirming that the AEC can remove PFAS to below 4 parts per trillion, beating the new EPA health advisory levels; confirming that the AEC can reduce salts and other ions, opening the door to additional applications for municipalities and industrial facilities with varying water quality challenges; and confirming removal of ""ultrashort"" PFAS molecules from water, an extremely rare capability in the water industry, further differentiating the technology against the competition.*
* *The technology was also successfully bench-scale piloted for multiple Fortune 500 level industrial clients for treatment of wastewater, with the potential to lead to on-site piloting and full-scale projects.*
* *Commenced ""alpha testing"" of a mobile test kit that detects PFAS levels in minutes without the need to send water samples to a lab, developed by Verralize, Inc., an innovator of next-generation water testing technologies. Able to give an operator instant feedback on water quality, we believe Verralize's test kits will enhance BioLargo's PFAS treatment service offerings and offer opportunities for co-marketing and distribution.*
* *Recently started working with a large international water treatment technology company. The two companies have agreed to work together to serve a specific client project, creating a new potential selling channel for BioLargo's PFAS treatment technologies and gaining access to the partner's treatment equipment and components. Additional teaming agreements with industry leaders to expand our market reach are in discussion and expected to be engaged.*

*While it has taken a long time for BioLargo to achieve success in the water treatment industry, our work has resulted in the company achieving recognition for its role in technology innovation and thought leadership, culminating in our PFAS technology leaders routinely being engaged as expert speakers and trainers for the industry, as well as the appointment of BioLargo's CEO to the U.S. Department of Commerce International Trade Administration's Environmental Technologies Trade Advisory Committee (ETTAC) and as Chairman of its Enabling Innovative Technologies (EIT) subcommittee. (See* [https://www.trade.gov/ettac](https://pr.report/ckgq) *for more info.)*

*Our work with Garratt Callahan (with whom we have co-developed a technology that enables reuse of cooling tower water, e.g. at data centers) is also continuing as we support selling and business development on their part. We remain confident that we will find success together despite the significant delay on this front.*

*Is it worth it? Consider that this is important work for mankind and that most of the heavy investment lift is done. We control 100% of the equity created in this subsidiary. We need to continue to support deal making with partners, and support sales and marketing as we show up to compete for work and advance the market acceptance of our innovation and technical solutions, that naturally comes with proof in the field over time. We can contract for manufacturing when our volumes start to grow beyond our current infrastructure. So, given the relatively low investment requirements and the global scale of the PFAS remediation industry that arguably has a 50-year market run ahead: YES, we target an enterprise valuation of north of $1 billion and believe that we will have ample partnership or exit opportunities along the way to lessen our risk and generate a handsome return for our stockholders.*

***ONM Environmental and Private Label Products***

*Our financial statements have shown an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in cash and cash equivalents since June 30, 2024, and decreasing revenue since a peak in the second quarter of 2024. These changes resulted directly from a decrease in sales of private-labeled pet-odor control products under the brand Pooph, and that same customer's increase in time between invoice and payment. As a result, we have increased our financing activities to ensure we had available cash to meet operational obligations. As we have secured capital by utilizing our equity line, those shares are sold into the market. The uses of the line is limited in scope and volume, but nonetheless can put downward pressure on our stock price. Given our careful use of this instrument in the past, we wish to assure our stockholders that we are judicious and intend to reduce this activity as soon as we are able. These dynamics have contributed to downward pressure on our stock price, and as predicted in our first quarter report, we expect to report results consistent with these trends for the second quarter. The good news is that we have been able to establish a payback arrangement of the amounts owed to us, including interest on outstanding balances, and believe we have mitigated most of our go-forward credit risk with careful inventory management and cooperation by Pooph, Inc. and its team. Further, Pooph recently launched new advertising campaigns as part of a renewed sales push. We remain optimistic that Pooph has turned the corner towards a renewed growth effort, and we continue to work in close coordination with their team to ensure their success. Nonetheless, we remain optimistic that as progress continues across our other business segments, the downward pressure on our stock price will be mitigated. If and when Pooph re-establishes its growth trajectory, we can win even bigger with the Pooph team. In either scenario the pressure on our stock and company should lessen as we move ahead.*

*Is it worth it? Consider: We have turned a relatively obscure difficult market into a high growth and high-profile product category that has established a national following and generated meaningful sales and cash flow in the past. We need this business to stabilize with our distribution partner and grow. We plan to do everything we can to assist. So, time will tell and in mean time, we manage risk carefully and hope for the best.*

***Engineering & Environmental Services - Expanding Our Reach***

*Our engineering division - BioLargo Engineering, Science & Technologies (BLEST) - showed Q1 revenue growth while also providing vital support for our technology commercialization efforts. In the first quarter of 2025, BLEST's revenues grew 152% year over year, driven by strong demand for its comprehensive environmental engineering services.*

*Key growth drivers for BLEST include:*

* *Fence-to-fence air quality services contracts with several U.S. Air Force bases continue to be a significant source of ongoing engineering services revenue.*
* *Expansion into industrial wastewater treatment and odor control, with new contracts from food processing and manufacturing facilities across the Southeast U.S.*
* *Growth in regulatory permitting and compliance services, helping clients navigate increasingly complex environmental regulations.*
* *Cross-selling opportunities with our PFAS and odor control technologies, reinforcing BioLargo's integrated value proposition.*
* *We are actively engaged with clients developing scope of work and budgeting for several significant projects. While not finalized, our clients indicated that they are likely to proceed. As a summary consider:*
   * *Pilot-scale plant at an industrial facility with a potential contract value exceeding $1 million.*
   * *Project to develop technology for converting natural gas into valuable materials potentially worth $1 million.*
   * *Ongoing or upcoming engagements that include industrial process improvements, prototyping of new thermal systems, and a multimillion-dollar proposal for seawater desalination byproduct utilization.*
   * *Project to develop a leachate treatment system for a client has progressed from bench-scale studies to plans for an on-site pilot, potentially leading to a $3 million full-scale system.*

*BLEST's strong performance not only helps provide stable cash flow but also deepens our relationships with large municipal and industrial customers, creating synergies that benefit our technology divisions.*

*Is it worth it? Consider: Back in 2017 when we added the engineering team to our company, the market expressed considerable doubt. Time has proven how fundamentally the engineering team has strengthened our company - it supports implementation of our core technologies, creates opportunities for new innovations, all while growing its top line revenue along the way to carry the infrastructure. Answer: one of the smartest moves we ever made!*

***Our Vision - A Robust, Diversified Growth Platform***

*We are intentionally building a diversified portfolio where each business unit - advanced medical, energy storage, water treatment, odor control, and engineering services - can thrive individually while contributing to BioLargo's collective growth.*

*Our diversification strategy has proven especially wise over the past two quarters as we continue to advance our commercial efforts into meaningful and high growth business opportunities like Clyra and our Cellinity battery technology.*

*Our business model leverages our core competency of science and engineering while it reduces risk through diversification, creates multiple paths to revenue, and maximizes shareholder value. We believe that our solution in each of these verticals has the potential to be a market leader in its own right, and together they embody our mission to solve some of the world's toughest challenges with sustainable innovation.*

***Thank You for Your Support***

*We enter this next phase with optimism and determination. Our technologies are no longer simply in development - they are actively entering markets, generating revenue, and impacting lives.*

*We often hear the phrase from investors, ""BioLargo has four shots on goal, just imagine if one goes in"", and we believe this demands a strong correction. We believe fully that each of these commercial endeavors will find significant commercial success and add value to our stockholders.*

*Your continued trust enables us to drive this transformation forward. We remain steadfast in our commitment to transparency, operational excellence, and creating long-term value for all our stakeholders.*

*As always, be sure to refer to our most recent quarterly and annual reports on forms 10-Q and 10-K for the most complete information about our company.*

*Thank you for being part of the BioLargo journey. Together, we are building a future defined by innovation, purpose, and shared success.*

*Sincerely,*

*Dennis P. Calvert*  
*President & CEO, BioLargo, Inc.*

Interesting one, so many segments... I will certainly be watching it!

I have to drop this quote from their 10-k here... Be sure not to get starstruck in the near term.

**We intend to continue these financing activities and thus intend to continue to dilute existing and future stockholders.**

Full quote below
__


During the year ended December 31, 2024, we (i) sold $260,000 of our common stock to Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (“Lincoln Park”) (see Note 3), (ii) sold $334,000 of our common stock and warrants to accredited investors (see Notes 3 and 6), (iii) sold $2,005,000 of Clyra common stock (see Note 10), and $50,000 from the sale of BETI common stock (see Note 9). These are dilutive to our existing stockholders, and the stockholders of our subsidiaries. **We intend to continue these financing activities and thus intend to continue to dilute existing and future stockholders.** Sorry - not buying what you’re selling. No need to be sorry. Thanks a lot for the comment.
I hope you have a purposeful company that you believe in! 
Best of luck!

Edit. I believe that much that I added 150k shares on the recent dip ;)

1m7aj4q,2025-07-23,"Update on $CJMB after deeper look at UPS link, India setup and state-level contracts
I posted a while ago about Callan JMB ($CJMB), a low-float microcap that might be involved with UPS Healthcare’s upcoming Premier Platinum platform. Since then I’ve been going through filings, business records and whatever else is available to get a better sense of what’s solid and what’s just speculation.

Most of the important threads originally came from u/JohnnyPayps on X. He’s posted several key leads, including the UPS emails. He deserves credit for surfacing this early. I’ve mostly just organized what’s out there.

**1. UPS has acknowledged CJMB in email correspondence**

UPS has not issued any press release or SEC filing regarding CJMB. However, in direct customer support communication, a UPS Healthcare representative confirmed that Callan JMB is involved in the initiative:

>""I can confirm that this initiative is indeed in collaboration with Callan JMB, and we truly value the trust and credibility they bring.""

There are two versions of the email circulating, sent at different times. No contract terms or formal partnership details are mentioned, and it’s unclear what level of involvement is implied. Still, it’s a notable reference, especially for a company with under 700k float and a market cap below $25M.

* [Screenshot of UPS email #1](https://imgur.com/a/uEHO56i)
* [Screenshot of UPS email #2](https://imgur.com/a/xiwNN0P)
* [CEO mentions UPS agreement discussion at \~25:15 in this investor video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jd60QwGaHdcTCnTBSHX4_9iI5SoQEhaj/view)

**2. Their tech fits UPS’s platform requirements**

UPS describes Premier Platinum as a cold-chain logistics solution with real-time tracking of temperature, humidity and light exposure. It uses cellular and GPS (not RFID, not passive sensors).

CJMB’s main product, Sentry, does exactly this. It tracks all those metrics in real time via cellular connection. It’s already been used for clinical trials, biologics and diagnostic sample handling. They’ve mentioned Grail as a customer.

UPS has said the platform is currently in beta and is expected to launch later this year.

* [UPS Premier Platinum launch info](https://imgur.com/a/RZajv7x)
* [UPS Healthcare white paper (Cold Chain Logistics)](https://imgur.com/a/tMHyTCI)

**3. They are bidding on public health and emergency logistics contracts**

CJMB already has a logistics contract with the City of Chicago. They also brought in Chris Shields, who previously led emergency preparedness for the city. According to the company, he’s now helping them scale into additional state and municipal contracts.

Most notably, they’ve placed a bid with the State of Illinois for a logistics contract worth up to $300 million over 10 years. Even a modest win here would have a material impact given the company’s size.

* [Screenshot of CEO quote about Chris Shields](https://imgur.com/a/DD4zx2n)

**4. The Revival Health joint venture is unclear but potentially relevant**

CJMB has entered into a joint venture with **Revival Health**, which they describe as a wellness company with over $5 billion in cumulative revenue. That figure may be inflated, but CJMB claims they’ll be handling all logistics for them through the JV.

Even limited activity here could be meaningful, given the company's size. The JV is mentioned in investor decks and has appeared in other DD threads.

* [Callan JMB and Revival Health JV press release](https://investors.callanjmb.com/pr/callan-jmb-andrevivalhealth-form-joint-venture-to-strengthen-us-supply-chain-for-vital-health-wellness-and-longevity-products)

**5. They registered a subsidiary in India**

On June 20, CJMB registered Callan JMB Services (India) Private Limited in Pune. It appears in the Indian business registry with full corporate details, and the company issued a press release confirming the move.

The stated goal is to support international expansion, with a focus on clinical trial logistics and sample export. Given India’s fast-growing life sciences sector, this could be an early step toward building global relevance for Sentry.

* [Press release on India subsidiary and warehouse plans](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/07/15/3115688/0/en/Callan-JMB-Inc-Launches-Subsidiary-in-India-and-Progresses-to-Establish-Temperature-Controlled-Warehouse.html)

**Final note**

CJMB operated as a private LLC for years and appears to have been profitable before going public. They distributed over $8 million to insiders between 2023 and 2024. They’ve handled logistics for government and health agencies, and their transition to a public company in early 2024 was cleanly executed.

This doesn’t look like a typical microcap shell. It looks like a functioning small logistics company with some traction, and now trying to scale.

**Why I’m watching**

No analyst coverage. No major press. Hardly any trading volume. But there’s already indirect confirmation from UPS support. The tech clearly matches. They’re pursuing serious state-level contracts. They’ve opened a foreign subsidiary. The Revival JV is uncertain but interesting.

Feels like a case where the public information is already out there, but the market hasn’t absorbed it yet.

**Risks**

* UPS chooses a different or broader vendor group
* No formal announcement due to NDA or other restrictions
* Illinois bid doesn’t go through
* Revival JV underdelivers
* India expansion stalls
* Operational or execution risk
* Illiquidity

This post reflects my own research and opinions. I am not a financial advisor. I’m long and treating this as a longer-term position, but I may reduce if material catalysts play out.

It's still early, and several pieces could fall short. But from where I sit, it looks like they’re actively building something, and if even one or two parts hit, the current valuation doesn’t make sense.
Very interesting , put a post on this one This should also be cross posted to WSB. Gaining traction today, good call! Good! A VP at the company took a call with me and confirmed the ups partnership

1m7a9w8,2025-07-23,"Antimony Heats Up: $UAMY Hits Highs – Is $MILIF the Next Play?
With United States Antimony Corp ($UAMY) hitting new highs today after CEO Gary Evans’ Fox Business appearance, antimony is suddenly on everyone’s radar. This little-known metal is critical for defense (ammo, armor, night vision), energy storage, and fire-retardants — but 80-90% of global supply is still dominated by China.

$UAMY’s breakout shows investor appetite is here, but it’s now trading at a premium. A second mover I’ve been watching is Military Metals ($MILIF), which owns a 100%-interest in the historic West Gore antimony-gold project in Nova Scotia.

They just released assay results from stockpiled material at site (once Canada’s largest antimony producer):

* 40.6% antimony + 106.5 g/t gold in one sample
* Five samples averaged \~17.9% Sb and 34.7 g/t Au
* Historical records show production of 46% Sb concentrate and 6,800+ oz gold (WWI-era)

Management says drilling is set to start soon on three untested targets outside the old mine workings. Nova Scotia also recently announced streamlined permitting for metals, which could be a tailwind.

**Why I’m Watching This:**

* $MILIF is still trading near consolidation lows while $UAMY breaks out
* Chart is showing a falling wedge (possible reversal) with rising volume on green days
* Potential synergy: Military Metals could even ship stockpiled ore to $UAMY’s smelters (the only ones in North America) for near-term cash flow
* Gold kicker if exploration hits

This is a high-risk, high-reward situation (sub-$20M market cap). But with antimony prices over $60,000/ton and geopolitical tension driving demand, it feels like a sector worth digging into.

**Anyone else following the antimony space? Thoughts on $MILIF as a sleeper play?**
**$MILIF** looks like a solid play with these strong assay results (17.9% Sb, 34.7 g/t Au). Shipping ore to **$UAMY**’s smelters could bring quick cash and I have been following **$PPTA** since they received funding from the DOD, could see more antimony companies on their radar as well Im in Yes they can easily ship the stockpiles to $UAMY bulish I have my sights on Ucore rare metals, Cotec holdings and mkango

News Link: [https://www.accessnewswire.com/newsroom/en/chemicals/biolargo-provides-review-of-2025-accomplishments-and-insights-for-coming-year-1051814](https://www.accessnewswire.com/newsroom/en/chemicals/biolargo-provides-review-of-2025-accomplishments-and-insights-for-coming-year-1051814)

***Letter to stockholders***

**WESTMINSTER, CALIFORNIA /** [**ACCESS Newswire**](https://www.accessnewswire.com/) **/ July 23, 2025 /** BioLargo, Inc. (OTCQX:BLGO), a company that creates and commercializes sustainable technologies to solve tough environmental and cleantech challenges, today provided a mid-year review of its business highlights for 2025 and a commentary on its outlook for the coming year, in the form of letter to stockholders from the company's President and CEO, Dennis P. Calvert, set forth below (and which can also be found at [www.BioLargo.com/blog](https://pr.report/ckgo)).

**Read the letter to stockholders from Mr. Calvert below:**

*Dear Valued Stockholders,*

*As we advance into the second half of 2025, we extend our heartfelt thanks for your continued support and belief in BioLargo's mission to create breakthrough solutions for a greater good while building value for our stockholders. This year, we are witnessing the culmination of years of strategic investment and R&D, with several of our business units approaching inflection points in the commercialization of the technology they were formed to develop and implement. We are pleased to provide a review of each subsidiary's primary area of focus and share highlights of our company's work to shape the future and drive value for its stakeholders.*

*In each case, it is important to remember that our investments in these technologies and companies have allowed us to develop a combination of validated technical claims and product features that we believe are unmatched in the marketplace. While they have inherent value, we know that to maximize our return on investment, we must advance them into commercial adoption and prove their market value in generating sales and profits. We have not wavered from this mission, and as a result have achieved a critical mass of financial resources, technical validations, product designs, and a highly qualified team to lead the charge forward. We firmly believe that the ""harvest will be realized"" as our pathway to generating substantial financial results is near at hand. Our low valuation creates a substantial buying opportunity that you should verify for yourself and is most certainly worth a deep dive. We will break each of our opportunities down in this letter, but we also highly encourage you to dig deeper, do your due diligence and know that we are fully committed to our success in realizing substantial value.*

***Clyra Medical - Entering the Next Stage of Commercialization***

*Our partially owned (52%) subsidiary Clyra Medical has invested years in research and development to create an unparalleled infection control and wound care product line that we believe will be transformative because of its performance and its patient-friendly, non-irritating formulation. We are confident that Clyra will make an impact for the greater good - the table is set, the mark is in sight, and we are marching towards the goal. How so?*

*In Q2, Clyra announced a series of sales and distribution agreements covering both U.S. and international markets. These agreements are expected to make Clyra's products available for purchase by 6,100 hospitals, 6,300 ambulatory surgery centers and 2,200 specialty wound care clinics in the U.S. alone. With unmatched performance claims, it is rewarding to see these innovations now reaching the healthcare settings where they can begin saving lives and improving clinical outcomes in ways not previously possible.*

*Highlights for Clyra Medical include:*

* *Platform technology - advanced wound irrigation - is FDA-cleared for broad clinical applications, including chronic wounds and surgical procedures, and first product, Viaclyr, headed to market through an established distributor, including internationally.*
* *A second product, developed for a specific distribution partner, is progressing through final regulatory and logistical processes in preparation of its product launch, for which Clyra has spent considerable resources establishing at-scale manufacturing capable of producing over one million units annually. While the details we provide are intentionally limited to protect any competitive advantages prior to launch, the evidence of our persistence, diligence, care, precision and substantial investments are in plain sight.*
* *Recent infusion of new capital of $3.3 million supports Clyra in its development efforts, scale operations, and to be prepared to meet demand.*
* *Clyra is developing additional products based on its FDA-approved platform technology, including wound gels, dental, nasal sprays, absorbent pads, negative pressure wound therapy, and aesthetic products.*

*Clyra continues to advance its selling propositions supporting future product-line expansion and opening doors to specialized vertical markets like military medicine and burn units.*

*Will it be worth the wait? To start, the market for Clyra's innovations is significant: according to the CDC, there are over 50 million inpatient surgical procedures annually, 6 million of which arise from chronic wound care. Clyra's products are highly differentiated and represent a potent solution for this significant market need. We have journeyed along this path for over a decade, invested our careers and substantial capital. We have survived when others fail. We have overcome an ""army"" of opposition. We now have leaders from industry with us, and Clyra is poised for massive success. Answer: ""YES"".*

***Battery Technology - Transforming Energy Storage***

*Cellinity, our revolutionary battery technology, continues to gain traction with prospective joint venture partners around the world that want to manufacture and supply batteries that store electricity for municipalities, data centers, EV charging stations, and other critical uses. We believe Cellinity can fill the global need for ""long duration energy storage"" batteries that can be better than lithium (and other technologies) by dispensing electricity over longer periods of time, having a longer useful lifespan without performance degradation, that can be sourced domestically without rare-earth elements and scarce minerals, and that have a better performance and safety profile.*

*How will we get Cellinity to market? Through a business model that preserves our cash, generates revenues long before first battery sales, empowers others to take financial risk, and provides diverse and ongoing revenue streams for our company. We quaintly describe our business model as ""sell factories, not batteries"". It contemplates a joint venture partner that hires BioLargo to engineer, design and build a factory to manufacture Cellinity batteries, licenses from BioLargo the right to make Cellinity batteries in exchange for an ongoing royalty on sales, contemplates BioLargo providing key components of the supply chain at a profit while retaining a 19% ownership of the joint venture entity formed to operate the factory.*

*This ""sell factories, not batteries"" business model has many benefits for our partners and for our company. It's a strategy that preserves our cash, while empowering our joint venture partners to create locally financed projects, local employment, local economic development, local high-tech jobs, energy resilience, and dramatic wealth creation. It empowers each partner to sell Cellinity into the particular industrial market of their choice, like data centers and EV charging stations. We believe this is a globally scalable model which can fill a gap in a market that* [*The Economist*](https://pr.report/ckgp)calls *""clean energy's next trillion dollar business"" (see* *Clean Energy's Next Trillion-Dollar Business**,* *The Economist**, Sept 2024).*

*In sum, we're commercializing a breakthrough battery technology that addresses a massive global demand, backed by a highly appealing business model - making this a venture with significant financial upside.*

*We've had several important successes in the past year in our mission to develop and commercialize Cellinity batteries:*

* *Built and tested prototype battery cells, verifying the technology's original claims of high energy density and voltage, capacity retention over many cycles, and safety (no runaway fire risk) when subjected to physical damage.*
* *Third-party validation of many of Cellinity battery cells' key advantages for use in grid-scale energy storage by U.S. BESS Corp, an expert provider of advanced energy storage solutions.*
* *Signed four memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with prospective joint venture partners interested in building and operating Cellinity battery factories as part of the company's business model to ""sell factories, not batteries"". These prospective JV partners as well as a growing list of prospects are highly varied, and include large industrial infrastructure developers, industrial real estate developers, data center developers, energy developers and even governments. For some, it's about economic development, benefits to local workforces, and grid and energy resiliency for their communities or constituents, and for some they're attracted to the potential financial upside.*

*The next step will be definitive contracts with our current prospective joint venture partners to start project development of the first factories, with us taking the role as project manager and engineer, generating revenue from the outset for these services. Each factory will cost over $100 million to build and will have the capacity to generate $500 million in revenue annually, and a handsome profit for all the parties involved for years to come.*

*Feedback from the market and potential joint venture partners reinforces our conviction that no other battery technology can match Cellinity's claim-set for grid-scale energy storage.*

*And, as we work to establish joint ventures to build factories, our engineers continue work advancing the battery technology and design to the container-sized grid-scale battery that will ultimately be sold to industrial users.*

*Is all this worth it? Consider: it starts with a great technology and a great team, continues with a capital-conserving strategy that shifts financial and operational risk to others, and ends with solving one the most pressing problems facing the planet in what is being called the ""next trillion-dollar business"". Economic incentives are robust in these areas and will play a key role in our success.*

*Answer: Yes, we know that we have a winner, and we target an enterprise value north of $2 billion. Time to get to work!*

***PFAS Treatment and other Water Treatment Technologies - From Pilot to Commercial Rollout***

*Our Aqueous Electrostatic Concentrator (AEC) technology removes per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from water, the ""forever chemicals"" now subject to regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. We're excited to give an update on our efforts to commercialize the technology and will continue to do so as more projects are secured.*

*With stricter state and federal mandates taking effect and the seemingly never-ending litigation against polluters, demand for reliable, cost-effective PFAS removal is steadily growing. Our technology is well positioned in this increasingly stringent regulatory environment because of its broad-spectrum capabilities (it captures all PFAS species tested), its low waste-byproduct production (waste increases costs and regulatory complications for operators), and its low operating costs compared to incumbent technologies like carbon filtration.*

*Our team has developed an integrated ""full-service"" water treatment package, combining AEC technology with engineering design, installation, destruction of PFAS, field testing and maintenance capabilities - offering clients a true turnkey solution that can generate revenue for BioLargo earlier in a project's lifespan.*

*Key progress this year includes:*

* *The company's first paid PFAS treatment project in New Jersey is well underway, with an AEC unit ready for installation and awaiting completion of construction of the treatment facility by the project's general contractor. Once installed, our team will deliver the AEC, complete installation and testing, and work with regulators to complete commissioning.*
* *Advancing the claims by running bench-scale pilot programs confirming that the AEC can remove PFAS to below 4 parts per trillion, beating the new EPA health advisory levels; confirming that the AEC can reduce salts and other ions, opening the door to additional applications for municipalities and industrial facilities with varying water quality challenges; and confirming removal of ""ultrashort"" PFAS molecules from water, an extremely rare capability in the water industry, further differentiating the technology against the competition.*
* *The technology was also successfully bench-scale piloted for multiple Fortune 500 level industrial clients for treatment of wastewater, with the potential to lead to on-site piloting and full-scale projects.*
* *Commenced ""alpha testing"" of a mobile test kit that detects PFAS levels in minutes without the need to send water samples to a lab, developed by Verralize, Inc., an innovator of next-generation water testing technologies. Able to give an operator instant feedback on water quality, we believe Verralize's test kits will enhance BioLargo's PFAS treatment service offerings and offer opportunities for co-marketing and distribution.*
* *Recently started working with a large international water treatment technology company. The two companies have agreed to work together to serve a specific client project, creating a new potential selling channel for BioLargo's PFAS treatment technologies and gaining access to the partner's treatment equipment and components. Additional teaming agreements with industry leaders to expand our market reach are in discussion and expected to be engaged.*

*While it has taken a long time for BioLargo to achieve success in the water treatment industry, our work has resulted in the company achieving recognition for its role in technology innovation and thought leadership, culminating in our PFAS technology leaders routinely being engaged as expert speakers and trainers for the industry, as well as the appointment of BioLargo's CEO to the U.S. Department of Commerce International Trade Administration's Environmental Technologies Trade Advisory Committee (ETTAC) and as Chairman of its Enabling Innovative Technologies (EIT) subcommittee. (See* [https://www.trade.gov/ettac](https://pr.report/ckgq) *for more info.)*

*Our work with Garratt Callahan (with whom we have co-developed a technology that enables reuse of cooling tower water, e.g. at data centers) is also continuing as we support selling and business development on their part. We remain confident that we will find success together despite the significant delay on this front.*

*Is it worth it? Consider that this is important work for mankind and that most of the heavy investment lift is done. We control 100% of the equity created in this subsidiary. We need to continue to support deal making with partners, and support sales and marketing as we show up to compete for work and advance the market acceptance of our innovation and technical solutions, that naturally comes with proof in the field over time. We can contract for manufacturing when our volumes start to grow beyond our current infrastructure. So, given the relatively low investment requirements and the global scale of the PFAS remediation industry that arguably has a 50-year market run ahead: YES, we target an enterprise valuation of north of $1 billion and believe that we will have ample partnership or exit opportunities along the way to lessen our risk and generate a handsome return for our stockholders.*

***ONM Environmental and Private Label Products***

*Our financial statements have shown an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in cash and cash equivalents since June 30, 2024, and decreasing revenue since a peak in the second quarter of 2024. These changes resulted directly from a decrease in sales of private-labeled pet-odor control products under the brand Pooph, and that same customer's increase in time between invoice and payment. As a result, we have increased our financing activities to ensure we had available cash to meet operational obligations. As we have secured capital by utilizing our equity line, those shares are sold into the market. The uses of the line is limited in scope and volume, but nonetheless can put downward pressure on our stock price. Given our careful use of this instrument in the past, we wish to assure our stockholders that we are judicious and intend to reduce this activity as soon as we are able. These dynamics have contributed to downward pressure on our stock price, and as predicted in our first quarter report, we expect to report results consistent with these trends for the second quarter. The good news is that we have been able to establish a payback arrangement of the amounts owed to us, including interest on outstanding balances, and believe we have mitigated most of our go-forward credit risk with careful inventory management and cooperation by Pooph, Inc. and its team. Further, Pooph recently launched new advertising campaigns as part of a renewed sales push. We remain optimistic that Pooph has turned the corner towards a renewed growth effort, and we continue to work in close coordination with their team to ensure their success. Nonetheless, we remain optimistic that as progress continues across our other business segments, the downward pressure on our stock price will be mitigated. If and when Pooph re-establishes its growth trajectory, we can win even bigger with the Pooph team. In either scenario the pressure on our stock and company should lessen as we move ahead.*

*Is it worth it? Consider: We have turned a relatively obscure difficult market into a high growth and high-profile product category that has established a national following and generated meaningful sales and cash flow in the past. We need this business to stabilize with our distribution partner and grow. We plan to do everything we can to assist. So, time will tell and in mean time, we manage risk carefully and hope for the best.*

***Engineering & Environmental Services - Expanding Our Reach***

*Our engineering division - BioLargo Engineering, Science & Technologies (BLEST) - showed Q1 revenue growth while also providing vital support for our technology commercialization efforts. In the first quarter of 2025, BLEST's revenues grew 152% year over year, driven by strong demand for its comprehensive environmental engineering services.*

*Key growth drivers for BLEST include:*

* *Fence-to-fence air quality services contracts with several U.S. Air Force bases continue to be a significant source of ongoing engineering services revenue.*
* *Expansion into industrial wastewater treatment and odor control, with new contracts from food processing and manufacturing facilities across the Southeast U.S.*
* *Growth in regulatory permitting and compliance services, helping clients navigate increasingly complex environmental regulations.*
* *Cross-selling opportunities with our PFAS and odor control technologies, reinforcing BioLargo's integrated value proposition.*
* *We are actively engaged with clients developing scope of work and budgeting for several significant projects. While not finalized, our clients indicated that they are likely to proceed. As a summary consider:*
   * *Pilot-scale plant at an industrial facility with a potential contract value exceeding $1 million.*
   * *Project to develop technology for converting natural gas into valuable materials potentially worth $1 million.*
   * *Ongoing or upcoming engagements that include industrial process improvements, prototyping of new thermal systems, and a multimillion-dollar proposal for seawater desalination byproduct utilization.*
   * *Project to develop a leachate treatment system for a client has progressed from bench-scale studies to plans for an on-site pilot, potentially leading to a $3 million full-scale system.*

*BLEST's strong performance not only helps provide stable cash flow but also deepens our relationships with large municipal and industrial customers, creating synergies that benefit our technology divisions.*

*Is it worth it? Consider: Back in 2017 when we added the engineering team to our company, the market expressed considerable doubt. Time has proven how fundamentally the engineering team has strengthened our company - it supports implementation of our core technologies, creates opportunities for new innovations, all while growing its top line revenue along the way to carry the infrastructure. Answer: one of the smartest moves we ever made!*

***Our Vision - A Robust, Diversified Growth Platform***

*We are intentionally building a diversified portfolio where each business unit - advanced medical, energy storage, water treatment, odor control, and engineering services - can thrive individually while contributing to BioLargo's collective growth.*

*Our diversification strategy has proven especially wise over the past two quarters as we continue to advance our commercial efforts into meaningful and high growth business opportunities like Clyra and our Cellinity battery technology.*

*Our business model leverages our core competency of science and engineering while it reduces risk through diversification, creates multiple paths to revenue, and maximizes shareholder value. We believe that our solution in each of these verticals has the potential to be a market leader in its own right, and together they embody our mission to solve some of the world's toughest challenges with sustainable innovation.*

***Thank You for Your Support***

*We enter this next phase with optimism and determination. Our technologies are no longer simply in development - they are actively entering markets, generating revenue, and impacting lives.*

*We often hear the phrase from investors, ""BioLargo has four shots on goal, just imagine if one goes in"", and we believe this demands a strong correction. We believe fully that each of these commercial endeavors will find significant commercial success and add value to our stockholders.*

*Your continued trust enables us to drive this transformation forward. We remain steadfast in our commitment to transparency, operational excellence, and creating long-term value for all our stakeholders.*

*As always, be sure to refer to our most recent quarterly and annual reports on forms 10-Q and 10-K for the most complete information about our company:* [*www.biolargo.com/sec-filings*](https://pr.report/ckgr).

*Thank you for being part of the BioLargo journey. Together, we are building a future defined by innovation, purpose, and shared success.*

*Sincerely,*

*Dennis P. Calvert*  
*President & CEO, BioLargo, Inc.*

1m76a26,2025-07-23,"ARECs partnership with Impossible metals
This partnership could actually be massive.
Impossible Metals has created the first autonomous underwater robotics platform that can harvest polymetallic nodules from the ocean floor. These nodules contain copper, cobalt, manganese and rare earth elements that are in increasingly high demand. Used in military, batteries, magnets and chip fabrication 

Both companies are aligned with the mission of the US to produce rare earth's to be more independent from China. And both have the vision in doing this in a efficient, scalable and responsible way. The robot only harvests the nodules without visible life on them. 

I read that there is an estimate of 20 trillion tons of materials that can be harvested from underwater resources compared to the 14 trillion tons on land.

Currently they'll be harvesting from American federal waters around American Samoa. If this proves successful, they might expand. If the harvesting of these nodules in international waters will ever be allowed is under heavy debate, due to uncertainty in the scientific community about the effects of this on the deep sea ecosystem.

I think ARECs technology with reelement, producing high purity rare earth's from recycled materials, waste and mined materials is definitely a stand out in the field. Have been a long time holder. Excited to see where they go, they've been making moves and expanding operations to different states and countries, so I'm expecting big things!

1m73z6o,2025-07-23,"Learning my lessons from stocks like $ABVX for betting on clinical stage biotech.DO they
https://preview.redd.it/yd07kinuqkef1.png?width=439&format=png&auto=webp&s=b97c3e70fc9b32a7757eb202f34ffd21d08b011a

This is a discussion I had last weekend with my bestie (a French guy).  
I had never heard of ABVX, but it was mentioned on this sub last Friday or Saturday. The OP was probably French, as the post was written in French, explaining the progress of ABX464 and how big its potential was — and how the positive result of Phase 3 was imminent.

I left a reply to that post to remind the OP that the ticker ABVX was missing from the post. The post gained very little attention and was eventually deleted — probably because the stock price was around $10 at the time and didn’t meet Rule #1, and also because it was written in French.

However, it was a very interesting post, and I was convinced after spending some time doing further research. I even bookmarked it, planning to make an investment later this month. All my current positions were in profit and had high chances of receiving positive news soon (except for IMRN), so I decided to wait until next week for my salary to make a move on ABVX.

I was a little naive as well, assuming that there was NO WAY a French company would release anything between July and August. I live in Luxembourg, just 12 metres from the French border, and literally nothing gets done between July and August around here.  
My friend had also invested all his cash, and all his positions were green — so he didn’t buy any either.

Anyway, I’m not trying to go on ranting about missed opportunities.  
ABVX’s journey is still a long way to go, and how the stock price will move from here is still unclear.

However, I’d like to focus on some common sense that needs to be considered for successful betting:

# 1) Strong Phase II Results

Science speaks for itself based on evidence and data.  
ABVX has shown compelling data, and long-term studies support the results — especially from their 48-week / 96-week OLM Extension.

# 2) Under the Radar

Despite very convincing data, ABVX was mostly unheard of and gained very little attention, especially on subs like this.

A couple of reasons:

* non-USA based
* stock price out of penny stock range
* small cap, but not too small
* not-so-sexy target disease: *ulcerative colitis*

Being low profile with a strong new drug candidate is, in my opinion, one of the most positive factors.

A few sayings to reflect on:

* ""Empty vessels make the most noise""
* ""Still waters run deep""

# 3) First-in-Class Mechanism

Most potential comes from candidate drugs that show true innovation.

If you look deeper into ABVX, Obefazimod (ABX464) is a first-in-class drug.  
It suppresses multiple pro-inflammatory pathways and essentially offers a broader, safer anti-inflammatory effect — without the immune suppression and severe side effects of traditional drugs.  
Most importantly, it works for patients who don't respond to currently approved treatments.

# 4) Relatively Low Trade Volume Prior to Spike

It's bloody obvious, but if it's under the radar, it will have lower trade volumes.  
And when combined with 1), 2), and 3) — any good news can cause it to shoot up vertically.

Furthermore, if the bottom support is confirmed, it's ideal.

# 5) Safety

The FDA is transforming the NDA pathway and tightening standards for early approvals.  
**Safer drugs will have much better leverage going forward.**

Few tickers to consider, I won't detail too much, you can do your own research and decide for yourself.

$CGTX - first-in-class, super safe drug, super phase 2 results  
  
$IMRN - less sexy, but you can smell it (literally), not necessarily first-in-class for their main drug but proven for its safety and efficacy. Laughable volume, boring as xxxx, need patience. Huge spike can be expected with positive news.

$ALGS - best-in-class HBV drug in the pipeline, Phase 2 to begin soon but extensive Phase 1 results show game changing potential. (long term play, can watch until 2026 or start small. Cash over $100M but likely to start to dilute from end of this year or early next year if no big partnership is announced)
Thanks for the post. 

Finally a good post on this sub, that is not just full speculation and it is based on something. Appreciate it. Up 500% pre-market lol Not the first time I've not been French enough. Well done to anyone who caught the surge. Mods need to get rid of Rule 1 ASAP. There are many sub-1B companies that are legit small caps, so they would never let their stock prices fall below 5, specifically because they don't want to lose their institutional investors.

This is a piss rocket that’s slowly been chugging back cold ones all night and hasn’t got up
Yet! When it gets up it’s gonna be LOUD 

Lithium related stocks up🆙📉✅

Some analysts predict a shortage as soon as 2026 which would make for a very steep price recovery over the coming months

as you can see related stocks are reflecting that!

With the increasing demand for zero emission vehicles and the need to create a circular economy, the battery recycling industry is inevitably set to see new and prosperous growth opportunities

Recyclico battery metals holds patents in several countries including Canada ,USA , Japan to a second to none recycling process for lithium ion battery’s. The efficiency is remarkable with a 99% return on metals (3rd party tested) patent.  for a closed-loop hydrometallurgical process.They are the ONLY
Ones with a battery ready material once it comes out of their patented process. 


I recently spoke with investor relations and they  said there’s something big in the works and for me to call back in a couple weeks if I wish to discuss it. So hopefully this is going to be some great news .

The stock looks well
 Bottomed. The market depth has a heavy support at .045 at over 3m shares on the bid. I speculate this is the last week at these levels. 

Disclaimer: I am a shareholder, I have 400k and plan to double that this week.
If I see the company doing as I suspect long term I will continue to add to the position over a long term basis.

1m6uetj,2025-07-23,"PRPL DD: Can Purple Turn Green?

Current Price: $0.82 (up 22% past week!)  
Market Cap: $82.79M  
52-Week Range: $1.50 - $0.56  
Next Earnings: August 4, 2025  
Price Targets: Mean $3.30, High $5.00, Low $1.60 (303%-510% upside)

The Setup

Alright dumb dumbs, let me tell you about Purple Innovation (PRPL). This is a legitimate deep value play with activist backing that most people are sleeping on.

Here's the deal: PRPL makes weird rubber mattresses, they've been getting destroyed for the past few years (though it's up 22% this week), but they have a massive activist investor (Coliseum Capital) that owns basically half the company and has taken control of the board. These guys can't keep fucking around.

What They Actually Do

Purple makes those gel-based mattresses you've probably seen advertised. Premium stuff, not the cheap foam garbage. They sell direct-to-consumer online and through retail partners. The big news is they're doubling their presence in Mattress Firm stores from 5k to 12k locations this year.

The market opportunity is massive: Average American spends $754 on a new mattress, with 35.9 million mattresses sold annually in the US. Industry profit margins run 40-50%, so there's serious money to be made for companies that execute well.

Product quality is actually solid: A CNET reviewer just published a 5-year review of the Purple Hybrid Premier 3, reporting ""I didn't experience any persistent aches and pains during the entire five-year span"" and said the mattress held up well over time. Industry reviews consistently praise Purple's durability, calling it ""extremely durable, and should give you at least 10 good years.""

Competitive advantage: While traditional innerspring mattresses (33% of US market) have only 65% customer satisfaction, Purple's unique GelFlex Grid technology creates a distinctive feel that people either love or hate, but those who like it tend to really stick with it. This differentiation matters in a commodity market.

The Numbers (Don't Skip This Part)

The financials are rough but showing signs of life:

Revenue: $472M trailing twelve months, down about 10% year-over-year. Q1 2025 was $104M, down 13% but the decline is slowing.

Margins: Gross margin around 42% which is actually solid for this industry.

Profitability: They're losing money - about $67M net loss over the past year. Not great, but they're cutting costs.

The scary part: Debt-to-capital ratio of 98.2%. Yeah, they're basically leveraged to the tits. Return on equity is -199.8% vs industry average of 3.9% - literally the worst in their industry. Their balance sheet is completely fucked, which is why the stock is trading at 0.16x sales.

Cash: $21.6M on hand. Enough to keep the lights on while they turn this around. No dividend obviously - they're bleeding cash.

Why This Isn't Just Another Dying Retailer

Here's where it gets interesting. Coliseum Capital owns 49.9% of this company. That's not some hedge fund taking a flyer - that's a controlling stake. These guys fought a proxy battle, got rid of management's poison pill, and put their own people on the board. The chairman is literally from Coliseum now.

Coliseum originally tried to buy the whole company for $4.35 per share back in 2022. Current price is $0.82. Do the math.

Their track record isn't amazing - they win about 1 in 3 bets, but when they win, they win big. They typically hold positions for 6-7 quarters, so this isn't a quick flip for them.

The Mattress Cycle Thing Everyone's Missing

This is actually important. Mattresses aren't like phones - people replace them every 7-10 years. During the pandemic, everyone bought new mattresses in 2020-2021 because they were stuck at home. That created a massive hangover in 2022-2024 because nobody needed new mattresses.

But here's the thing - the people who bought mattresses in 2015-2018 are starting to replace them now. The industry data shows replacement cycles are actually shortening to 6-8 years, especially for younger buyers.

PRPL's revenue peaked at $725M in 2021, crashed to $573M in 2022, then $511M in 2023, then $488M in 2024. The decline is slowing and we're probably near the bottom of the cycle.

What Could Go Right

Near term: Q2 earnings on August 4 could show margin improvements and successful retail expansion. If they beat expectations, this thing could run hard on low float. The stock is already moving - up 22% in the past week alone, and options volume is up 51% ahead of earnings.

The numbers are ugly: They're ranked 150 out of 246 in their industry (bottom 39%). Current consensus has them losing $0.11 per share in Q2 and $0.32 for the full year. But here's the thing - when expectations are this low, any positive surprise can create massive moves. They have a 50/50 track record on earnings surprises over the past 12 quarters.

Revenue outlook: Analysts expect revenue growth to 4.3% in 2025 ($467M) and 5.9% in 2026 ($517M). This actually looks optimistic compared to the industry forecast of -5.5% decline in 2025 and +3% growth in 2026. If PRPL can grow while the industry shrinks, that's market share gains.

Medium term: The Mattress Firm rollout is real - doubling their retail presence should drive sales. With 16,000 mattress retailers in the US (more than Starbucks locations), retail distribution is fragmented and valuable real estate. Housing market is starting to recover which helps mattress sales.

Activist catalyst: Coliseum didn't take control of this company to watch it die. They could push for a sale, major restructuring, or strategic changes. Remember, they valued it at $4.35 two years ago.

Valuation: Analyst price targets show mean $3.30, high $5.00, low $1.60. Current price is $0.82, down from a 52-week high of $1.50. This thing has been absolutely destroyed. Trading at 0.16x sales - that's distressed territory. Only 2 analysts cover it, which explains the volatility.

What Could Go Wrong

The balance sheet is trash. If sales don't recover quickly, they could be in real trouble. The Altman Z-Score shows bankruptcy risk.

Cyclical business. Even if the mattress cycle is turning, it's a slow process. This isn't going to moon overnight based on fundamentals alone.

Execution risk. New management, activist pressure, retail expansion - lots of moving parts that could go wrong.

Macro headwinds. If the economy tanks, premium mattresses are one of the first things people defer buying.

This is a volatile beast. Beta of 1.70 vs S&P 500, best daily return 19.1%, worst -8.8%. Monthly swings from +82% to -46%. You've been warned.

The Bottom Line

This is a turnaround play with activist backing trading at distressed valuations. The mattress cycle is probably bottoming, they have real catalysts coming up, and there's a 50% owner who's actively trying to unlock value.

Something might be brewing: The stock is up 22% in the past week with no obvious news. Either someone knows something, or the market is finally recognizing the value here.

It's not risk-free - the balance sheet sucks and execution matters. But if you're looking for a deep value play with real upside potential, this fits the bill.

Position: I'm looking at calls into the August earnings and potentially shares for a longer hold if they show progress.

Catalysts to watch:

* August 4 earnings
* Mattress Firm expansion updates
* Any SEC filings from Coliseum showing increased activity
* Housing market recovery data

Do your own DD, but this one's worth watching.

TLDR

Beaten down mattress company with 50% activist owner who took control and wants to unlock value. Trading at 0.16x sales with $3.30 mean price target (303% upside). Already moving - up 22% this week. Earnings August 4. High risk, high reward.


Some pump here today. the increase last week was due to them moving up their earnings release to july 29

^(if) ^(you) ^(have) ^(any) ^(questions) ^(or) ^(concerns.) Looks primed for the current meme run, this was a good one on wsb back in the day. Ready for liftoff? I think until Q3 '25 we ride a wave between $0.70 - $1.35. I wanted to get into multi-billion dollar valuation projections, but my data shows a **3-9 month play with a min of $6.5 and max of $8.90**. Anywhere between that range, Coliseum is in the money with great returns. Anything less, they take losses in the 10s of millions (upwards of 300-400m+ loss if they exited between now and $2). Their historical average is arguably between 14%-20%+ profits on their investment.

Right now, Coliseum is down BIG and at the upper range of their historical timeline for how long they hold an investment. 3-9 months until an acquisition or market turnaround would fit their timeline perfectly. **If we enter into a relieved housing market and the mattress industry cycle pumps, then $2.5bn valuation is justifiable.**

1m6q6g8,2025-07-22,"[DD] Actual DD Done For You: If you liked $OPEN meet $VERI
I just threw a fat stack into $VERI. THESIS: unless the world stops needing AI or the U.S. government stops loving overpriced software, we’re making money here. 

$OPEN confirmed what I already suspected, we’re living in a rare window of time where broken down stocks are actually potential gold mines in disguise. You just need to stare at charts all day, break up with your girlfriend and pop adderalls like they’re candy. 

Luckily for you, I’ve done all three. 

Enough about me and onto where we make money. Interest rates are forecasting two cuts by end of 2025. That means one thing, it's time to start looking for deep value written off stocks that are about to become treasure.

Here I present you **$VERI who’s trading <$3 while traded >$40 in 2021.** Was the valuation stretched there, absoutlely yes. But do we have a 5x-10x opportunity here, yes.

**TL;DR for People With a Brainstem:**

* Stock is down like it got hit by a bus and then reverse-ran over
* Still sitting on \~$40M in cash and massive federal contracts
* Has the *actual tech* and real customers
* Pivoting to government AI + SaaS = sticky revenue = dollar signs
   * Think Palantir. I wrote a similar thesis in 2021 and made bank. 
* Trading at 1x revenue. Yes. One. Times. Revenue. This thing is a cheat code if they execute (PLTR trades at \~100x).

**Why It's Down:**

Because Wall Street is either too lazy to read an earnings transcript or too busy chasing Nvidia call options to notice this tiny AI gorilla building inside the government like it’s f\*\*\*ing Skynet.

They used to be a scatterbrained AI-for-everything company. That sucked. Now? They’re focused on their best product: 

* Law enforcement? ✅
* Military intel? ✅
* Media automation? ✅
* Real-time audio/video AI tools? ✅

Basically, if you need to transcribe, translate, redact, or analyze hours of chaos, they’ll feed it to the AI and give you back gold.

**The Setup:**

This is a *cocked spring*. Here’s what I’m betting on:

* **Backlog over $110M+** and growing. That’s called *money already won* waiting to be converted.
* **Bookings growing again** \+22% YoY. 
* **VDR (gov SaaS product) is exploding** — used by DOJ, Air Force, cops, your paranoid uncle.
* **Breakeven EBITDA guidance in 2026** — aka ""stop burning cash and start stacking it.""
* **ARR might stabilize** — when it does, this baby flies.

**Valuation Is a Joke**

Let me say it again for the people with Robinhood accounts:  
**Trading at 1.2x revenue** while selling AI to the U.S. f\*\*\*ing government.

Meanwhile, Palantir is 20x revenue, and they’re literally doing the same thing but with better PR.

This is what they call “deep value,” or as I call it, “discounted future Lambo.”

**But Wait, There’s Moat**

* They’re **CJIS-compliant** — that means they can handle confidential government data. Not just any startup can walk in the room.
* They're **model-agnostic** — like AI Switzerland. OpenAI, Google, custom LLMs? Doesn’t matter. Feed it in, get it out.
* Once they're in a federal workflow? Good luck displacing them. The gov moves slower than a snail on Xanax.

**Why It Can 5–10x?**

Because:

* Market starts giving a sh\*t about small-cap AI again
* Government funding for AI goes parabolic (already happening)
* They *just execute* on their backlog and start converting it to revenue
* AI hype catches up and some idiot on CNBC says “Veritone’s the next Palantir” and the apes pile in

**Risks? Sure:**

* They keep losing ARR and miss bookings
* Burn too much cash and get diluted
* Miss the AI wave because they try to be *too* useful
* Someone makes a better version of their platform and markets it better
* Government contracts take forever because bureaucracy is the real final boss

**Monitoring Plan:**

* Is revenue going up next quarter? Good.
* Is backlog > $125M? Great.
* Did they stop lighting $10M on fire every quarter? Perfect.
* Did the Pentagon give them more money? TO THE MOON.

**Conclusion**

This is my **small cap, AI under the radar, Palantir for the people** play. It’s up well off the bottom already with no one talking about it. This could go 10x by end of 2026.

VERI has:

* Real customers
* Real tech
* Real upside
* Real f\*\*\*ing cheap valuation

I’m betting the nerds win, the government pays, and the stock goes BRRR. See you at $10 or in the unemployment line.




I'd love to read a write up that wasn't done by ChatGPT [deleted] lol, this isn’t a queue system Not a squeeze play. Macro tailwinds (rate cuts), valuation arbitrage (1x revenue), and turnaround story on revenue and profitability. Think we're in early innings! Kudos to anyone who got in earlier I’m sure there is legitimate value here, but chatGPT famously hallucinates and tbh I just don’t trust any shiller who can’t even type their own sentences. Too many bots on here, if you can’t even take the time to actually type a post then I have to assume you’re one of them. 800% debt/equity ratio. Making losses since at least 2020. >**Why It's Down:**

>Because Wall Street is either too lazy to read an earnings transcript

Well, let me tell you why it is really down.

*Before looking at their products, we have their finances:*

However, as a matter of fact they currently operate at a **loss of 0.79$ per share**. Furthermore, they might have an increasing backlog but they also have a **119M$ debt** and only 16M$ in cash and equivalents- meaning they will have to dillute their stock further creating downward pressure. They already increased outstanding shares by almost 10%. Looking further at their debt: their **net cash per share is -1.91$** which means that the only reason that their market cap exceeds their book value us because of this recent pump. *They are not undervalued, in my opinion.*

*Now let us look at their products.*  
  
What I do like is how diversified they are- they pretty much offer any generic AI capability out there, and they offer the means to implement it into a variety of tech stacks. This is also a risk though; I do not see a strong unique selling point. Especially with regards to competing with Palantir in the public sector. I think they would do well to develop something only they can do. Right now they're fighting competitors with the capacity of burning VERIs entire market cap on training a single AI model, and I doubt they will win that battle of giants.

TL;DR: not a long term play until the postive signals OP signals at hold up, but even this might not be enough to turn the tide- they need something unique and a problem only VERI can solve. You can make some quick cash riding the pump though and it is a stock to monitor. Grandmaster obi alerted this a couple days ago, in case anyone was wondering about the recent uptick. I've been watching for a while, just pulled the trigger, feel you man! Still think there's a lot of room to run! Agree, and priced as so. Not w/o risk but burns been reducing and set to breakeven by 2026. If they can execute on their backlog and continue reducing burn, this can turn into a growth catalyst. That's how you find high returns.

1m6mn2r,2025-07-22,"Niobay Metals (NBY.V / OTC: NBYCF): 6 cent critical minerals explorer, with drilling underway.
I came across Niobay Metals (NBY.V / OTC NBYCF) in Equity. Guru’s[ recent “15 explorers to watch” list](https://equity.guru/2025/07/21/15-mining-explorers-that-are-interesting-right-now-and-why/) and decided to dig in a bit.

Niobay is a small Canadian critical minerals explorer with a market cap around 9.2 million. It is up about 50 percent in the last month but still trading under 6 cents USD.

Their main project is Crevier in Quebec, where drilling is currently underway. The project targets niobium and tantalum, both listed as critical minerals in Canada and the US.

They also hold:

• Foothills, a titanium project in Quebec. Historical intercepts included up to 22 percent TiO₂  
• James Bay, a niobium project with a prior preliminary economic assessment

In a [recent interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16GNSkghCmE), CEO Jean-Sébastien David said they have already sent samples to battery and steel companies in Europe and are currently waiting for feedback.

Additional details:

• Quebec government-backed grant for Crevier  
• First Nations-led drill crew  
• Shares outstanding approximately 108.5 million

Wondering if anyone else is watching this or has looked into it.

1m6jokc,2025-07-22,"HCTI - the sleeping giant
It is showing movement.. but as someone working in this industry, I like this stock and I think it has value. Back in the days, I should have bought NVIDIA as an avid gamer. I didn’t buy NVDA cheaper and I regret very much now. 

I don’t want to do that mistake again with $HCTI. I would like to stick with this one and I am following the company closely on LinkedIn and also their news releases. They are now in the AI transformation process and Healthcare (EMR/EHR) is one area which will benefit a lot from this. Especially most of the medical coding and transcription are being outsourced to India and Philippines for millions of dollars each year. AI 
Is an enabler in this industry and can help save millions of dollars and also make the work more efficient.

1m6j4iy,2025-07-22,"New ExoPTEN Preclinical Study Indicates Significant Improvement in Walking Quality in Spinal Cord Injury Model
**Medium and high doses improved movement quality in up to 100% of the animals in a dose-dependent manner**

https://preview.redd.it/pd4ioqjsegef1.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=828d0edc523ed08abf0f1f9f8057f9c54501a389

TORONTO and HAIFA, Israel, July 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NurExone Biologic Inc. (TSXV: NRX) (OTCQB: NRXBF) (FSE: J90) (“**NurExone**” or the “**Company**”) is pleased to announce new preclinical results demonstrating that 100% of small animals treated with a higher dose of ExoPTEN regained motor function after spinal cord injury. The results of the preliminary, dose-ranging study were confirmed using precise measurements using the CatWalk XT system.

Using the CatWalk XT system, researchers assessed ExoPTEN’s effect on the animals’ ability to walk. All animals (100%) in the higher-dose group demonstrated measurable gait recovery, in contrast to one animal in the untreated group which exhibited minimal stepping.

“This is a significant milestone for our program,” said Dr. Tali Kizhner, Director of Research and Development at NurExone. “Seeing the animals regain the ability to walk, with measurable improvement in locomotion function, is incredibly exciting. The CatWalk XT provided us with objective data that strengthens the scientific foundation for ExoPTEN’s potential to restore function after an acute spinal cord injury.”

In the study, researchers compared medium and high single doses of ExoPTEN, administered minimally-invasively on the day of spinal cord compression surgery, to a control group that received injection of the vehicle only. Medium and high doses used in this study refer to escalating dose levels used to explore potential therapeutic effects and tolerability in animals.

The treatment demonstrated a dose-dependent effect, with 100% of animals in the high-dose group regaining walking ability in both hind limbs, compared to 50% in the medium-dose group, and only 1 out of 6 rats in the untreated control group (Figure1 A-B).

The gait analysis data also showed dose-dependent improvement in walking function. Animals treated with higher dose of ExoPTEN displayed larger paw print areas (Fig. 1C), greater maximal contact area of their hind paws (Fig. 1D), a wider base of support (Fig. 1E), and an extended duration of the paw contact with the walkway (Fig. 1F). These indicators reflect improved balance, strength, coordination and weight bearing during walking.

Evaluation of additional study parameters is ongoing. Notably, the high dose was well tolerated, with no observed side effects. As part of this ongoing work, the Company plans to initiate additional studies to explore alternative dosing regimens, while also advancing the optimization of ExoPTEN’s manufacturing processes and analytical methods. These efforts aim to refine the drug’s therapeutic profile and facilitate engagement with regulatory authorities.

The CatWalk XT system, developed by Noldus Information Technology, is widely considered a leading tool for studying animal movement^(1). It uses an illuminated glass walkway to capture footprints and movement patterns, allowing researchers to collect precise, objective data on an animal’s motor function.

NurExone continues to advance its research and development efforts, optimizing ExoPTEN’s dosing strategies and manufacturing processes, and preparing for regulatory submissions as it aims to launch first-in-human clinical trials. The Company remains committed to developing treatments that bring new hope to people who suffer nervous system injuries.

**About NurExone**

NurExone Biologic Inc. is a TSX Venture Exchange (“**TSXV**”), OTCQB, and Frankfurt-listed biotech company focused on developing regenerative exosome-based therapies for central nervous system injuries.

1m6i11u,2025-07-22,"ESGold – Buying opportunity? Flipping the Old Mining Model on Its Head
The last few days have seen **ESGold’s share price pull back pretty hard**, and honestly, it looks like one of those setups that might make sense for people watching from the sidelines. Here’s why I find this company interesting:

Most juniors spend years (and millions of dollars) drilling holes, building resources, and hoping one day to actually mine something. ESGold? They’re skipping all that. They’re going straight to where the gold already is.

# The Montauban Project – A Different Play

ESGold’s main project is **Montauban**, up in Quebec. It’s not some remote exploration dream—it’s a site that’s already been mined, with **millions of tonnes of historical tailings** just sitting there.

Those tailings still have plenty of gold and silver in them, but back in the day, the tech wasn’t there to get it all out. ESGold is using modern methods to recover that metal **without having to do fresh drilling or blast new rock**.

They’ve already:

* Installed a **gravity circuit** with Humphrey spirals (the stuff that separates gold from waste material).
* Expanded their plant to **4,000 sq. ft.** for processing.
* Raised **over $3.6M recently** to keep things moving forward.

This isn’t a “someday” kind of project—they’re already building the infrastructure.

# Why This Model Works

Here’s the part I like:

* **Speed:** They can start processing known material instead of spending years proving it exists.
* **Scale:** This approach isn’t limited to just Montauban. Tailings projects like this exist all over the map, and ESGold could roll this model out elsewhere.
* **Environmental Win:** Cleaning up old mine sites while extracting gold? That’s a narrative both investors and regulators like.

It’s basically mining 2.0: **low-risk, high-efficiency, and repeatable.**

# The Pullback

So, the stock has been hammered in the last few days, which might look scary at first glance. But if you believe in the idea of **“buying when others are fearful,”** this dip could be an entry point. The company hasn’t slowed down—construction is ongoing, they’re funded, and they just brought in a new CEO, **Gordon Robb**, who has a strong background in both mining and finance.

# Bottom Line

I like ESGold because they’re not doing the same old junior mining song and dance. They’ve flipped the model:

* Start where you already know there’s gold.
* Build a processing system.
* Generate cash flow faster.
* Scale the model to other sites.

With the stock price taking a breather, this feels like one of those times worth paying attention.
I disagree - I don’t think the selling was due to anything material. The stock took off so likely a bunch of people were just riding the upswing. The company has only been doing better and better, plus the price of gold increased so the company is technically worth more. Not sure what you mean about the CEO - his last position was in a resource company and also had a background in the finance world prior. I don’t think there could be more relevant experience than that. This is interesting, I am also currently following a similar turnaround story about Blue Gold Inc, [https://pennypulse.substack.com/p/is-blue-gold-the-ultimate-gold-comeback?r=1toy1h](https://pennypulse.substack.com/p/is-blue-gold-the-ultimate-gold-comeback?r=1toy1h)

^(if) ^(you) ^(have) ^(any) ^(questions) ^(or) ^(concerns.) I like it, but god damn is it a headache to calculate/estimate value from a mix of exploration and tailings I'm not sure the bottom of the dip is in. It defies recent positive coverage and may be an accelerating reaction to the new CEO, who is from another industry. Longer-term, difficulties valuing and diminishing returns on tailing could keep the share price undervalued for its P/E.

1m6d6zh,2025-07-22,"Silver's Structural Supply Crisis Creates Exceptional Investment Opportunities in Mining Sector - USAS | Crux Investor
USAS - Americas Gold and Silver 

* **Silver is experiencing its fifth consecutive year of supply deficits, with limited major discoveries and 18-year development timelines creating a structural shortage that should support sustained price appreciation.**
* **Generalist funds are showing their highest interest levels in a decade while ETF inflows have reached their strongest levels since 2022, indicating a fundamental shift in institutional recognition of the sector.**
* **Mining stocks are trading at 2018 levels despite silver's impressive 54% surge from $24 lows, creating exceptional entry opportunities for investors willing to position ahead of the institutional wave.**
* **M&A activity is rapidly consolidating the sector with fewer independent silver producers remaining, which increases the strategic value and potential acquisition premiums for remaining companies.**
* **Current $39 silver prices provide strong profit margins above $19 all-in sustaining costs, while triple-digit silver prices would be needed to justify new mine development, protecting existing producers from new supply competition.**

Americas Gold & Silver represents an established producer that benefits directly from current market dynamics. The company's flagship Galena Complex in Idaho's historic Silver Valley stands as the cornerstone of its operations, with plans to generate approximately 80% of total company revenue from silver by H2 2025. The complex's significant infrastructure, including two mills and four shafts with 55 miles of underground development, provides a robust foundation for increased production. As supply constraints tighten, Americas Gold & Silver's ongoing optimization efforts at Galena - including productivity improvements, equipment upgrades, and exploration of high-grade zones - position the company to capitalize on strengthening silver markets while advancing toward becoming a leading North American silver producer.

>

The implications for investors are profound. With current silver prices around $39 per ounce, the economics simply don't justify the massive investments required for new mine development. This creates a supply ceiling that should support higher prices for years to come, directly benefiting existing producers with established operations and permitted reserves.

Americas Gold & Silver's operational improvements and new leadership team at its Galena Complex highlight it as another turnaround story. The company's focus on cost management and operational efficiency has created a more robust business model that can generate strong returns even during commodity price volatility.

# The Valuation Disconnect

Despite silver's impressive 54% surge from its $24 lows earlier this year, mining stocks remain dramatically undervalued relative to historical norms. This disconnect creates what may be the most compelling entry point for precious metals investors in over a decade.

The valuation gap is particularly striking when examining production-adjusted metrics. Silver mining companies today are producing significantly more than during previous silver price cycles, yet their valuations remain depressed relative to historical norms. Many companies have doubled their production capacity compared to earlier periods when silver traded at similar levels, demonstrating substantial operational improvements while their market valuations have lagged behind

This valuation disconnect extends across the sector, with many established producers trading at significant discounts to their historical multiples. The anomaly appears to stem from several factors: institutional memory of previous mining sector disappointments, concerns about operational execution, and the cyclical nature of commodity investing that often creates extended periods of undervaluation.

# Production Economics: Strong Margins with Upside Potential

Current silver prices provide attractive economics for established producers while creating a price floor that should support sustained profitability. The margin structure of quality silver miners has improved significantly over the past decade, creating more resilient business models.

Modern silver mining operations benefit from operational improvements and technological advances that have reduced costs relative to previous cycles. However, inflation pressures remain a constant challenge.

Current silver prices around $39 provide healthy margins above the $19 all-in sustaining costs. This margin profile creates substantial cash flow generation capabilities for efficient operators.

Americas Gold & Silver's operational track record demonstrates the cash generation potential of efficient silver operations. The company's focus on cost control and operational optimization has created sustainable profit margins that support continued investment in growth initiatives and exploration programs. Huet states:

# Investment Thesis: Positioned for a Decade-Long Bull Market

The silver mining sector presents a compelling investment opportunity driven by structural supply constraints, institutional capital inflows, attractive valuations, and strong production economics. Multiple factors suggest the sector may be entering a sustained bull market similar to the 2002-2012 period.

The investment thesis rests on five key pillars:

* **Supply Deficit Persistence**: The market enters its fifth consecutive year of shortages with limited new supply coming online
* **Institutional Recognition**: Generalist funds showing their highest interest levels in a decade, driving sustained capital inflows
* **Valuation Opportunities**: Mining stocks trade at 2018 levels despite 54% silver price appreciation and doubled production capacity
* **Consolidation Premiums**: M&A activity reduces pure-play options creating scarcity value for remaining companies
* **Economic Moats**: Triple-digit silver prices would be needed for new mine development, protecting existing producers from competition

1m680i7,2025-07-22,"BZAI About to Leave Pennyland!
The last time **BZAI** gapped was last Thursday when **BlaizeAI** just received a contract for $120M from Starshine Computing Power Technology, summing its **total contracts to $176M for 2025/26**. Today (7/21/25) we had an increase in the analyst ratings to 6$ (https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/blaize-nasdaqbzai-rating-increased-to-buy-at-rosenblatt-securities-2025-07-21/), nowhere close to the P/E ratio of many AI companies (Real **EoY price target is $10-$16**). The true valuation is close to $50B+ with a TAM of over $240B+.

This is not a pump/dump company like OPEN, CLBR/PEW, BMNR or BBBY... It's a legit company. Surprisingly there is still little buzz on reddit about BZAI. **BZAI is an AI long play that already has a product**.

Firstly, **BZAI is a US based company, with US manufacturing at Texas**. Secondly, BZAI has **contracts/MoUs with SCPT, Gulf Ministry of Defense, CBIST Korea, and Turbo Federal**. You can read about it on the BZAI subreddits. This post will discuss only the reasoning about its current status, and future potential.

I assume people are unaware about the real heavy lifting hardware has to perform in order to realize actual AI products. Sure, NVIDIA designs GPU architectures that supports CUDA, but those chips are useless if you want to see AI at your doorstep. **You need an edge AI processor to churn the fast on-the-spot data and send only important features back to the central mainframe AI servers.**

Let's take an example, when you yell at Siri/Alexa/Cortana/Gemini to give you recommendations for food, your phone first translates your voice to bits, the bits are then aggregated into blocks of features. These features are then send to the central Meta/Apple/Amazon/Google servers to say ""look this person is hungry, what do we give them to eat?"", The NVIDIA GPUs in the mainframe servers crunch these features based on past/present/future personal likes and the business models they are trying to capitalize, and attempt to convince you to eat at perhaps Chipotle. The former, your phone is an ""edge processor"" the latter is a ""recommender system"".

This is exactly what Big 5 are trying to integrate, an ""AI"" processor onto the phone, because its not efficient/necessary to perform useless requests like your food recommendation on the actual mainframe servers that probably are cracking quantum entanglement. Chips like Google Tensor/Apple Neural Engine/Samsung Exynos 990 exist in the latest phones, which perform the trivial AI tasks. **This is where BZAI comes into play.** A phone is a piece of hardware that's broadly non-essential. **Essential AI products that need edge compute hardware** factor in size, space, data rates, energy dissipation and critical paths, interconnect speeds, cache coherency, and BRAM to name some and above all the software to integrate with the hardware. A full hardware-software stack! **BZAI provides this full stack in their packaged hardware-software solutions:**

* Blaize Pathfinder 1600 System-on-Module (SoM)
* Blaize Xplorer Accelerator Series
* Picasso® SDK AI Studio® [https://www.blaize.com/video/sdk-people-pose-detection/](https://www.blaize.com/video/sdk-people-pose-detection/)

**These solutions are built (as of Q2 2025) and only deployment remains, meaning profit, higher P/B, and revenue with a product that works! That's exactly what they did with the $120M and $56M contract.**

* Blaize’s hybrid AI solutions will be deployed for smart city applications including India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, and China, with use cases aligned to their AI infrastructure priorities.

**They promised this in Q1 earnings, and they delivered** **before Q3,** ""Blaize plans to announce a new vertical AI solution platform in Q3 2025, designed to simplify and accelerate deployment for smart city, defense, and infrastructure customers—extending its edge AI leadership into packaged, turnkey systems.""

Some more key points from Q1 are:

* Turbo Federal (Defense): Blaize's collaboration with Turbo Federal has progressed rapidly from strategic engagement to execution. The partnership is now entering the commercialization phase, with purchase orders in motion to deploy Blaize-powered servers and AI Studio orchestration software for perimeter security and real-time inference across defense environments.
* Ministry of Defense (Gulf Region): Blaize continues to deepen its engagement with a national Ministry of Defense, progressing through proof-of-concept and field qualification stages. These engagements are focused on delivering trusted AI inference capabilities for situational awareness and mission-critical decision-making.
* Smart Security Showcase (U.S. Market): At North America's largest physical security and smart infrastructure technology event, Blaize demonstrated real-time, deployable AI applications for perimeter defense, school safety, and smart surveillance. Integrated with partners such as OrionVM, Thrive Logic, and CVEDIA, Blaize's live demonstrations attracted significant interest from commercial and federal decision-makers seeking scalable edge intelligence solutions.
* CBIST (South Korea): Blaize was selected by the Chungbuk Institute of Science and Technology (CBIST) to lead the Chungbuk Digital Innovation Hub, delivering edge AI infrastructure to support regional smart city deployment across South Korea's Chungcheongbuk-do province.

With their first contract underway it's only a few weeks/months of time before they roll in their other signed contracts, of course its speculatively, but no drama and all the fun. Very positive and bullish sign.

Again the total addressing market is huge:

* Smart cities and traffic control - Real-time traffic analysis, pedestrian detection, and anomaly detection
* Retail & Industrial Automation - Shelf inventory analysis, foot traffic counting, and shopper behavior analytics.
* Smart Surveillance & Access Control - Real-time face detection, license plate recognition, threat detection.
* Healthcare Edge Applications - Remote diagnostics and point-of-care imaging analysis.
* Defense and Aerospace Situational awareness - ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance), drone video processing.

All that said, if you look at the charts. The options charts (still low volume) clearly shows that MMs are hedging bets at 5$, a price point that might be unavailable in the long term.

More details charts are available, perhaps in the next post.

1m5st7t,2025-07-21,"Resverlogix and Zenith Epigenetics news
 Resverlogix RVXCF (RVX,CA) is a tiny Canadian biotech which has jumped out of it's normal trading range of 3-4 cents to 16 cents today as a result of news about Zenith Epignetics .  Zenith was spun off from RVX in 2013 in order to  specialize in cancer drugs while Rsverlogix pursued FDA approval of it's Cardiovascular drug Apabetalone. 

# FDA grants Zenith’s ZEN-3694 Fast Track Status

July 14, 2025

# Zenith Epigenetics Announces Grant of U.S. Food and Drug Administration Fast Track Designation for ZEN-3694 in NUT Carcinoma

CALGARY, Alberta, July 14, 2025, Zenith Epigenetics Ltd. (“Zenith” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce the designation of ZEN-3694 as a Fast Track product by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). FDA officials concluded that ZEN-3694, in combination with abemaciclib, meets the criteria for Fast Track designation for the treatment of metastatic or unresectable NUT carcinoma in patients who have received at least one line of prior chemotherapy. The Company is also pursuing Orphan Drug and Breakthrough Therapy designations for ZEN-3694 in NUT carcinoma.

The plan is to sell Zenith to fund clinical trials of Resverlogix's drug Apapbetalone which has potential for a huge market.
With funding and a trial that hits the same end points as the last trial (replacing stroke with heart failure as a primary endpoint), Resverlogix’ drug, Apabetalone, could produce billions of dollars of revenues.  It's great to see some more positive news coming from Zenith, which in turn is great for Resverlogix! It's a good time to grab some more shares of RVX before things really get moving. This stock will be seeing 3 the moment zenith is sold and the monies will go to funding resverlogix. If….if… they pass phase 3 this stock can see anything over 30 . But that will take another 3 years. I am an owner of the stock and will not sell . This one will go through the roof. Do your own research. Go to chat and ask what the possibilities of apabetalone are. What it will be worth if they get approved by the FDA. This can be a 100-500 bagger . But not in 1 day. You need a 3 yr horizon. I’m in with 11,000 shares at $0.07. Let’s gooooo 🚀

^(if) ^(you) ^(have) ^(any) ^(questions) ^(or) ^(concerns.) At this point RVXCF (RVX.CA) is a play on Zenith.  I received 200 shares of ZHCLF in 2013 because I owned that many of RVXCF (I bought  many more RVXCF later with  a cost basis of 9 cents)  Although Zenith is a private company some shares began trading on the Pinks. I gradually acquired another 39,800 shares in 2021 until they moved it into the NASDAQ Expert Market and it became impossible to buy in the U.S.  For some reason Canadian brokerages continued to sell it to Canadian citizens only. There have been no trades since the FDA announcement.  I imagine if it did trade the price would far exceed the RVXCF gains. Still, I believe RVXCF will has a lot of room to run.

1.More than 40+ insider owned. Plus 20% institutional ownership is mostly long.

2. New CFO stock package are vested $10

3. Financial have been delayed (10-k filing), while RILY rework their assets and liabilities. Their due date is in September of 2025. So far their went from 1.7 Billion to a whooping 700 - 500 million debt left. The company is cashflow positive based on quarterly operating cash flow 88 million.

4. Major credit facilities and debt holders all restructured thus recent run up!

5.Recent shorts position to borrow has increase 400k-700k. The average to borrow shares was between 30k-80k. Which makes no sense since the OS and Float is 30m/16m with a whooping over 45 percent of short interest. Indicate naked shorting is on the rise to drive the price down.

5. There was FRG settlement won by them in April temporary spike RILY up 30%.

6. Lastly, this has similar pattern of gme of 2021. The bankruptcy, naked shorting, low float ticker, non- dilution has occur yet, etc.....

Feel Free to have an input or say.

1m5bbrc,2025-07-21,"Rare Earth Metals
I'd like to get some feedback on this . . . I started following this story, about 2 years ago, when discussion about it was still being whispered, and there wasn't much buzz about it yet.  And for those of you who haven't been following, here's the low down (if I understand this correctly, and please correct me if I'm wrong):  


**Rare Earth Elements (REEs):**

All electronics rely on these weird metals; like neodymium for magnets, Erbium, Yttrium, and so on.  And it's not that these metals are rare, per se . . . it's just that they're a pain to extract, and the traditional extraction process is extremely dirty.  A lot of toxic waste is produced.  So much so, that the EPA basically destroyed the entire industry in the US.

We outsource nearly all of it, for use here in the US.  China, of course, is where everyone gets their rare earth elements from.  For us, though, that poses a national security risk, as our fighter jets, guided missiles and so on, also rely on these materials.  So, we **must** start producing them domestically, and in a way that pleases the EPA.  And that's why I went with REEMF - they figured out a different extraction process that's way cleaner, got a patent, built a demo plant, and so on.  Not as a trade, but as an investment.

Now, we're getting news of a different company (MP): the Department of Defense is actually buying $400 million of their stock on the market (didn't even know that was legal).  As far as I know, they're still doing it the old-school way though; meaning, they're going to be severely hindered on production, by the EPA.  For now, it looks like they're only producing neodymium.  I don't know.

What do you guys make of this?  Do you think we're gearing up to loosen EPA restrictions?  While MP will be getting $400 million from the Pentagon (making it a 15% owner) over the next 10 years, REEMF already received about $45 million in grants from the US Dept. of Energy.    
  
If you could pick only one, which one?  And why?


Look at UURAF

Ucore just signed a new $18.4 Million deal with US DOD to refine Heavy REEs.  

Ucore.com I'm into UURAF I’m in UURAF, UUUU, LYNAS, ARRNF (very long term), ABAT, LAC, WWR, TMC. I have the highest convictions for UURAF, UUUU, Lynas. I like all of them though… they all have different things about them that the DOD will want Since you actually understand the term Rare in these cases, ypu must also understand it not new AND new material are being use to replace them. IF i was going to look at the industry to invest in, I would fine what other countries have them and see the connection to USA and if these can be invested in, and also see where Ablemarle is getting the from, see where #1 &#2 are getting there's.. happy hunting🫡 From what I can see MP is already up and running, their share price currently sits around $64.50.
Reemf $1.13. Their new plant has some teething issues but scheduled to be finished August 2025, then checks, inspections, up and running Q1 2026.
For me I see Reemf as having the better potential return in the long term

**Bottom Line Up Front**

[Treatment.com](http://Treatment.com) AI (**OTC: TREIF** |CSE: TRUE) will be reporting Q2 2025 earnings by the end of August-marking its transformation from a pre-revenue AI company to an organization generating $1.38M USD+ ARR based on historical revenue leading up to its most recent acquisition. While healthcare AI unicorns command billion-dollar valuations with minimal revenue, [Treatment.com](http://treatment.com/) AI (“Treatment” currently trades at a $24M USD market cap despite having innovative AI technology, proven revenue, and an announced pipeline of Medicaid contracts covering millions of underserved patients.

Trading at 31.87 cents as of close on Friday

**The Revenue Inflection Is Here**

For the first time in Treatment's history, their Q2 2025 financials are expected to show consolidated revenues following the April acquisition of Rocket Doctor - a technology-driven digital health platform and marketplace serving 600,000+ patients across 4 provinces and 3 U.S. states. This isn't theoretical anymore. Treatment has announced:

* **Future projected additional $1.2M USD ARR** from California Managed Care Plan alone, with an anticipated GM of $18/visit across some 45,000 visits in Year 1
* **600,000+ patients** and **300+ physicians** on the platform
* **CVS Health Foundation** funding a 5 year, $1M grant to support older adults

The market hasn't noticed yet because Treatment has been quietly building. That's about to change.**The Medicaid Gold Mine Others Are Ignoring**

Here's what makes Treatment's strategy brilliant: one of its targets is the **71.3 million Americans on Medicaid**\- a massive, underserved population that other AI healthcare companies avoid because of ""lower margins.""

But Treatment's unit economics tell a different story:

* Medicaid patients pay **$0** to see doctors (fully covered)
* Treatment can earn **$18 per visit**
* **Chronic disease patients** require multiple visits annually (between 6 and 10)
* **Limited customer acquisition battles** with well-funded competitors

**New revenues** will also ensue from Rocket Doctor being announced as an **In Network provider for New York Medicaid approval** covering **6.9M Medicaid beneficiaries** (enabling affordable medical care accessibility for **\~ 35% of New York’s population)**.

**Tested Proprietary AI Technology but an Inferior Valuation**

Treatment's Global Library of Medicine (GLM) represents 9 years of physician-curated medical knowledge - not the probabilistic guesswork of large language models. Key differentiators include:

**Emphasis on Clinical Accuracy**

A non-medical undergraduate used Treatment's AI to **correctly diagnose 11 of 12 patients** in a medical school-level clinical exam (OSCE)—a **92%** success rate that demonstrates the platform's diagnostic precision.

**Curated vs. Generative AI**

While competitors like OpenEvidence ($3.5B valuation) rely on research papers (many of which are later proven false), Treatment's GLM uses:

* **Inputs from hundreds of doctors globally, since 2016**
* **10,000+ expert medical reviews**
* **1,000+ diseases and 15,000+ symptoms**
* **2nd and 3rd pass technology to enhance the accuracy of diagnostic recommendations (The platform will suggest which labs and imaging the patient should go for and when the results come back, it dynamically adjusts the differential diagnosis in real time based on the new data)**
* **Physician-validated diagnostic logic**
* **Audit trails** for every recommendation

**Multiple Deployment Options**

The GLM can be consumed in multiple ways, including powering chatbots, voice assistants, and avatars—all can be white-labeled and multilingual. Treatment has designed its platform to integrate with electronic medical records (EMRs), telehealth platforms, or health systems and can reside behind a client firewall for security.

**The Valuation Disconnect seems Evident??**

https://preview.redd.it/85flfui6i4ef1.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=f243b81614fab9ecc490ce95b9e2cc4be1376fab

​

Treatment acquired Rocket Doctor for a max payout of **$14.6M**—nearly half their current market cap. It could be perceived that investors today are essentially getting the proprietary GLM AI technology for free.

**Why the Market Missed This Story**

Treatment's journey illustrates a classic venture capital irony: the company with proprietary AI technology and a clear revenue path is trading at a fraction of pre-revenue competitors' valuations.

The reasons are structural:

1. **Public vs. Private**: Treatment trades on the Canadian Securities Exchange, not in Silicon Valley boardrooms
2. **Timing**: The revenue story only emerged with the Rocket Doctor acquisition
3. **Market Awareness**: No institutional coverage despite superior fundamentals

As one insider noted: *""We're trading on an overlooked exchange while inferior products get billion-dollar valuations from the right investors.""*

**Multiple Catalysts Ahead**

**Immediate (Q3 2025)**

* **Q2 earnings release** showing first consolidated revenue
* **Medicaid contract pipeline progression** across multiple states

**Medium-term (Q4 2025 - Q1 2026)**

* **Initial GLM licensing deals**
* **Potential expansion to additional states**

**Longer-term (2026+)**

* **Prospective NASDAQ uplisting** (target: $100M+ market cap)
* **Enterprise GLM deployments** across health systems
* **International expansion** through announced partnerships

**The Investment Case**

https://preview.redd.it/uz4vwnmai4ef1.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7f52dd4a533caea840b83714351dca44b449cc3

**The Investment Case**

**Revenue Validation**

Treatment isn't another AI story seeking product-market fit. They have:

* **Contracted revenue** from government Medicaid programs
* **Proven demand** from 600K+ patients and 300+ physicians
* **Award-winning platform** recognized at medical conferences

**Scalable Technology**

The GLM represents a **9-year head start** in medical AI that competitors can't replicate quickly. It's designed to be:

* **Clinically validated** by physicians
* **Regulatory-ready** with full audit trails
* **Platform-agnostic** for multiple deployment scenarios
* **Defensible** through physician network effects

**Market Timing**

Healthcare AI is the hottest sector in venture capital, with $3.95B invested in H1 2025 alone. Treatment offers:

* **Public market access** to private-market-quality AI technology
* **Revenue traction** that most AI unicorns lack
* **Undervalued entry point** before institutional discovery

**Risks to Consider**

**Execution Risk**

Scaling patient acquisition across multiple states requires operational excellence and regulatory navigation.

**Competition Risk**

Well-funded competitors may eventually target the Medicaid market, though Treatment's head start and relationships provide protection.

**Market Risk**

Healthcare AI valuations could compress, though Treatment's revenue base provides downside protection that pre-revenue competitors lack.

**The Bottom Line**

[Treatment.com](http://Treatment.com) AI represents a rare opportunity: a revenue-generating AI healthcare platform trading at a fraction of comparable valuations. The company has:

**☑️Proprietary and Accurate technology** (physician-curated vs. probabilistic AI)  
☑️**Existing Revenue model** ($1.38M USD+ ARR)  
☑️**Massive addressable market** (71.3M Medicaid patients)  
☑️**Multiple growth catalysts**  
  
While healthcare AI unicorns capture headlines with billion-dollar valuations and minimal revenue, Treatment has quietly built a proprietary platform, validated by clinicians, to serve millions of underserved patients with technology that actually works.

The Q2 earnings release will mark Treatment's coming-out party. For investors seeking AI exposure with revenue validation, this may be the last chance to get in before institutional discovery.

**Investment Highlights:**

* **Market Cap:** \~$24M USD
* **Revenue:** $1.38M USD + ARR (second quarter reporting in August)
* **Addressable Market:** 73M U.S. Medicaid patients
* **Competitive Moat:** 9-year physician-curated medical AI database

# A Note on Friday's Announcement:

As announced in [Friday's press release](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/treatment-com-ai-engages-marketing-213600464.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9maW5hbmNlLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9xdW90ZS9UUkVJRi8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMdwt0SQWy6kOerHOy2QdYav7Z0wVzOi9cq7YUsYBEeypXZPKUIBGL24HJ6nsPy3tVQyRSowAZn1lK3aSC8mbqk9w9Ak6bN-EC79GUTQ5jg9LBc7c-eIorn7ziW1RvJAZa07lg3LhhGplDS_WCEOiPyIl4SiYnscdhem61Kq8tg6), [Treatment.com](http://Treatment.com) AI has engaged 45 Degrees (me) for a 6-month investor relations agreement valued at $30,000/month plus 400,000 options.

**Before any ads go live, I wanted to tell my community first.**

**About my standards:** I review \~20 companies weekly and talk seriously with 4-5. No amount of money could make me promote a company I don't believe in or haven't invested in personally. My reputation with you matters more than any contract.

**For longtime readers**: You know I've been following Treatment's evolution. Now it has all the pieces—revenue, validated tech, institutional partnerships, and growth visibility.

Here's what this engagement means: Treatment is funding a $180,000 digital marketing campaign targeting retail investors before institutional discovery. You're getting this analysis first because sophisticated retail investors often spot value ahead of institutions. This isn't consulting fees, it's marketing capital to build awareness while Treatment still trades at a $24M market cap despite $1.38M+ ARR. You're seeing this before the broader campaign launches.

1m4kpj7,2025-07-20,"🧬 Comprehensive DD on AbCellera (ABCL): From 2012 to 2025 – Full Analysis & Insights
Hey everyone,

I just finished putting together a **deep-dive due diligence** on AbCellera Biologics (ABCL), covering its entire journey from 2012 to today. This document includes:

* A detailed history of the company and its founder Carl Hansen
* Analysis of their business model and key partnerships
* Insights into their proprietary pipeline and royalty-bearing programs
* Financial performance and growth trajectory
* My personal perspective on their long-term potential

The goal was to create a **thorough and objective resource** for anyone interested in ABCL’s story and future prospects. I relied on a wide range of publicly available sources and, since English isn’t my first language, I also used AI assistance to refine the writing and ensure clarity.

If you find any factual inaccuracies or areas that could be improved, please let me know. I’ve been reviewing it multiple times, but I’d gladly update it based on community feedback.

📖 **Here’s the full document (PDF)**: [Comprehensive DD on AbCellera (2012–2025)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y0uX7jH5d0uSDQY6EVTqtG7kNj7CKpLu/view?usp=sharing)

I hope you find it an interesting read and a solid starting point for discussion.
Im in You’re missing an important aspect here. AbCellera has a large and growing network of partners, many of them major players in the biopharma space, which significantly broadens its reach beyond Canada. In fact, their market is not limited to Canada at all a substantial part of their business and opportunities is tied to the US and global markets. ![gif](giphy|Q2aN4iiaibCus) That’s a good DD. But it’s biotech that happened to be in the right place at the right time and got lucky with a big windfall that gave it a long runway but isn’t likely to happen again. Discovering wild type antibodies are a nice idea and work for vaccine development and pandemics but market conditions are abysmal for vaccines and antibody therapy isn’t very good commercially other than pandemics. Most likely the company will either find M&A that will give it real revenue, wind down and distribute the cash they have, get bought out or plod along hoping to find another lottery ticket.  Biotechs working on ground breaking medicines are a dime a dozen and never pan out. This is the right stock, the right time, the right place 🤣 I have two thoughts for you.

First, if you genuinely believe selling is the right move for your situation, then go ahead and do it. No one else can make that decision for you.

Second, if you haven’t sold yet, maybe it’s because deep down you recognize what this company could actually be worth in the long run, and posts like this are just forcing you to confront that.

Either way, comments like “I need to sell tomorrow” don’t add much to the discussion. The terms were correct. You literally threw in the term “discovery” (which isn’t even a technical term) to try and sound smart and debunk my post. 

I used the correct terms. Antibodies are not discovered. They are produced from immunisations on humanised transgenic mice and then expressed using CHO expi cell expression systems. 

Also you don’t have 20 years experience. You did a PhD over 10 years (red flag), and several post docs for 7 years (huge permadoc ref flag) before landing an entry level job at a tiny biotech. You have literally 3 years experience running western blots at a small biotech…

1m43m09,2025-07-19,"Btog bit origin $BTOG
Hi folks, with the recent news about BTOG raising 500M to become a DOGE Treasury, how does this affect their stock price?

I have read on X, from a specific user that the FMV will be $10 per share based on the price movement of doge coin which itself shows upward movement of 25c onwards. 

I am both skeptical of this and kind of also holding it so not sure if I should exit or wait it out? 

Here is the link

https://x.com/Sigmentisti/status/1946606033801040190?t=Fm9cF_L4RzgU82rGHWWD_g&s=08

This doesn't seem like a heavily shorted stock at all, and it has regained listing rules.

Also dogecoin supply is not limited like BTC, 
This is a hilariously bold play. *If* there is an alt-season this cycle (it appears there will be), Dogecoin may perform well in it, and *if* BTOG hold through dips to sell near the peak this could revolutionise their balance sheet. But Doge has no use case. No interesting tech, no income stream (not even staking or reflections); just funny dog. This also isn't 2020-2021. That crypto run was insane because of Americans throwing in Covid stimulus cheques. There won't be a repeat in much grimmer economic conditions. So, can the BTOG board time an all-or-nothing memecoin market? It also hit 1$ Friday before going down...

1m42l7j,2025-07-19,"At Long Last! Q&A With Escalon Medical Corp. (OTCQB: $ESMC) CEO Richard DePiano Jr.
DISCLAIMER: I own a position in $ESMC

This post is a follow-up to 2 other posts I've made on Escalon Medical Corp. ($ESMC), [""Introductory DD on Escalon Medical Corp. (OTCQB: $ESMC)""](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1knkmgi/introductory_dd_on_escalon_medical_corp_otcqb_esmc/) & [""Escalon Medical Corp. (OTCQB: $ESMC) Buyout Candidate or Up-and-Coming Standalone Giant In Eyecare?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1luy5vg/escalon_medical_corp_otcqb_esmc_buyout_candidate/) Yesterday I was fortunate enough to have a Q&A session with $ESMC's CEO Richard DePiano Jr. I recommend you read through [the company's SEC filings](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=esmc&owner=exclude&action=getcompany) & [Sonomed Escalon's website](https://www.sonomedescalon.com/) to understand the history of the business & how it's changed.

I've tried to summarize the key takeaways (quotes may be paraphrased):

* *""Escalon is very personal for me...I wake up in the morning & think about how I can increase value, make the company profitable, & make it a good place to work, & I go to bed planning...to make it profitable for our shareholders, ensure a stable environment for our employees & work hard for our customers.""*
   * He's always had his heart in what he does, from working with his dad (former chairman & president) to his time as CEO.
* *""We always were very conscious of the assets: we'd buy and sell businesses, we'd do what was best for the business & shareholders while trying to be profitable.""*
   * Their focus is ophthalmology, 75% of the business being [their UBM device](https://www.sonomedescalon.com/vumax-hd). Sonomed's approach is agnostic, working synergistically with other technologies. **He believes Sonomed's ultrasound tech/software is ""the best out there,"" providing better imaging & data, especially now with the AI-assisted ICL Guru.** He also commented on the importance of [the recent study that was done using Sonomed's tech](https://www.dovepress.com/evaluating-the-predictive-accuracy-of-an-ai-based-tool-for-postoperati-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-OPTH).
      * The ICL procedure (a minimally-invasive alternative to LASIK) is gaining popularity, which could provide an ""uptick"" in sales for their ultrasounds. It's ""a *very safe procedure, quickly done, & less expensive. It does have a future & I feel that it's going to do really well. That's going to be our push.""*
   * 17% of the business is Trek, [their OEM side](https://www.sonomedescalon.com/surgical-solutions), &
   * 12% is [the Axis business](https://www.sonomedescalon.com/axis) (""*the Google Photos of ophthalmology*""); they were the first business to provide digital images for ultrasounds.
   * Their market is a pie and they *""fight hard for our share of the pie.*""
* They've had a time with tariffs but things have stabilized for now, being ""*really careful with inventories""* helping them navigate\*.\* A smaller business, they've been able to maneuver easier, refusing to accept products with large tariffs & looking elsewhere, just as they've strategically maneuvered the business in the past.

Their 10-K should be released 9-28 at the latest.
I hear you - trading strategies are different for everyone and I’ve come to dabble in trading more “active” stocks as a way to make some quick cash.

I’ll maintain that buying heavily into $CTM @ $.18 on 11/26 & 11/27/24 when it was averaging ~100k in volume was the best trade I’ve ever made. That’s my approach: lean in heavy and wait 🤙

This article has some good commentary (pros & cons because there are both) on thinly-traded stocks if you’re interested. Relevant to $ESMC, I believe, are the comments about macroeconomic factors/events. A change for the better *could* cause a rapid rerate of the stock.

Anyways, thanks for your kind response and for letting me share 🤙 Thanks for sharing,  trade volume is a big no no for me, but wish all the best. Disclaimer and full disclosure: 

I also have a position in $ESMC and also have collaborated with OP on research and DD. 

It’s fine if you want to call me biased and stop reading here…  

But I will offer that OP has approached this right. He’s reached out to the CEO of the company, respectfully requested the CEOs time, and that time was granted. We can’t ask for a more heads on, honest, and tbh - the most difficult kind of investing discussion. 

Because he has to ask the hard questions and hear the response from a very educated person in the form of a CEO (trust me…any CEO is smarter than 99.9% people here!). 

Most posts here only care about upvotes, throwing out a “YOLO/FOMO/lol”, or need to “burn” your fellow posters, mostly shit talking, and sometimes a dash of actual investment truths. 

Sometimes we need to make investments personal. Sometimes we need to treat them just like a relationship. We need to trust our instincts and believe in our long term viability with “this relationship”. It’s a testament to the passion and I’m a believer. 

And often times, just like in a relationship, the only way to have the real discussion about something is to hit it head on and talk to the other person in the relationship. 

Kudos, OP. But you know I’m biased ;) 🤙 Thanks for the shoutout! I really tried to dig into the good & bad, the pros & cons of the stock/company but it’s hard not to get excited… 🤙 Super,  I've bookmarked the stock, I can consider a small position of $500~1000

1m3g3no,2025-07-18,"Potential Deep Value Play: OMS Energy Technologies (OMSE)
Hi all,

First time poster, long timer lurker.

A stock came across my oversold scanner and I went into a bit of a deep dive. Too me this seems like quite an interesting swing trade setup.

  
OMSE had an IPO around May 2025. The stock had a nice bounce up but has steadily came down since to \~$7 a share. From a technical stand point, the price seems to be consolidating here and the OBV suggests potential stealth accumulation. 

This warranted some further study. Now, this is not some hyped up unlimited power, VTOL, semiconductor, your mothers Christmas sweater growth stock - this seems to be a deep value play with a huge potential once it gets noticed. 

OMSE is a Singapore based manufacturer servicing the oil and gas industry. Their play is that they specialize in surface wellhead systems and christmas tree assemblies (not the festive bullshit, its a critical piece of surface or subsea equipment installed on top of wellheads after drilling is complete. They control the flow of hydrocarbons from the well during production - look it up on your own time fuckers). They also make specialty connectors, pipes and other tubular goods. They do threading, inspection and repair services. Right now they service Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Burnei, and seems like they are expanding throughout Asia. 

What caught my eye, they just signed a 10-year supplier agreement with Saudi Aramco, expecting to net 120 MM to 220MM annually earlier this year - remember that buddies. 

This led me to dig deeper - its always nice to see a big player like that sign a long-term deal. OMSE is sitting on about $60MM in cash with only $2.3MM debt. They are virtually debt-free. They have about $86MM in working capital and a total of \~$200MM in assets. The book value/share sits at only $2.95. OMSE is sitting on a really nice balance sheet - low margin, high cash, and strong working capital. This gives them some flexibility to weather storms (i.e. tariffs) or fund expansion, land contracts, or whatever without needing to raise new capital. 

  
Lets dig into this a little more. OMSE has a market cap just shy of $300MM (42.5 MM shares outstanding with 65% insider ownership). They are trading at a P/E ratio of just 4.75. this is way below the industry standard and the overall broad Singapore Market. They are trading at a real deep value multiple - extremely cheap to cash flow (low risk, high reward). Knowing what we know about this stock right now and fair P/E value, which should be north of 10, the stock should be trading at $21+. But like I said, this stock has been real under the radar since their IPO in May. The volume is super low, it hasn't hit retail yet, I couldn't even find any mentions on Reddit. 

Lets just peel back what we know so far about the Saudi Aramco 10 year supply agreement. They are expecting \~200MM in revenue. At a 21.7% profit margin, that would equate to \~$55MM in net income. If there is any margin recovery, that net income could easily push to $70MM. This could be a 15 - 25% bump in revenue. Solidifying the 21+ dollar for share argument.  

The CEO recently also hinted at maintaining a solid balance sheet while looking for expanded growth. Their business in Thailand and Angola seems to just be getting started and there could be potentially even more customers in the Asia region they would be servicing. Especially with current geopolitical nature and the need to fund self-oil exploration. 

  
This stock seems like a spring ready to go. They have not, as of me writing this, announced their first earnings call since the IPO - but it should be sometime in the middle of August. Roth capital just initiated coverage on this stock with a short term price target of $10. If in the earnings call we get some clarity on the Saudi Aramco supply agreement, hints and growth through expansion in new markets, I think this stock could see a true re-rating in price based sole on P/E ratio against their peers. Also, if another analyst starts to cover this stock we could really see some accumulation and hopefully trading at a fair value.

  
There are no options yet on this stock, which could be another reason for lack of broader leveraged interest. 

  
Red Flags - it seems their inventories are increasing (with few data points that we have). Hopefully this is also hashed out in the earnings call and is related to maintaining sufficient supply for Saudi Aramco. Also their Accounts Receivable is increasing - normally this would be a red flag for me as it is taking longer for customer to pay and/or accept goods. However, as they are debt free with sufficient cash they could just be willing to float the credit (I also hope this is touched on in the earnings call). 

  
My positions, currently sitting on 350 shares at $6.88 cost basis. I'm looking to scale in over the next few weeks before the earnings call. If there is a clean break above $7 (preferably $7.20) this would give me stronger conviction to scale in faster and harder. The volume on this stock is currently pretty low, just to note. And with full transparency I just found out I'm losing my job November 1st. My whole team has already been canned but I was held on to ""finish some things."" So, this is forcing me to keep more funds in liquid cash as i'm not sure how turbulent my future will be (hence the small upfront position). 

I would really look forward to hearing anyone else thesis on this stock, or any other stocks that have some deeper value. I think this one is worth taking a closer look into. 



TLDR; OMSE potential real deep value play, profitable company with strong free cash flow trading at really low multiples. Potential catalysts coming up soon and big supply agreements with really large customers (Saudi Aramco). As well as eyes for expanding into new global territories. 
OMSE is a value play in my opinion....issue is SaudiAramco contract is currently their bread and butter 65-70% of total revenue. Also their partners in Thailand/Saudi want to get into renewables so realistically OMS Energy will soon need to pivot into R&D in order to be able to keep some their business partnerships. I do think that next 12 months after May IPO OMSE will experience upward movement in SP to 10USD maybe even 20USD. However, long term i'm not so sure.....that pivot into Renewables will require a lot of bankroll, of course not all partners are pushing for it but from what i read Thailand/Saudi are maybe 1 more.

I also i'm not sure about mid August financials....i've seen end of August/beginning of September also mentioned. Which could impact short term price movement because well...no news/action is rather dead and could plummet a bit lower.

Other than that they are making money....margins are solid something like 45-50%. Little to no debt.

Don't have a position currently eyeing $6.50 level.....however depending when the financial reporting is announced ill enter a position of 1000 shares minimum. I agree 100% - I should have put swing trade in the title. I’m looking this at the 2-3 month horizon. You make very good points! Thank you! Cactus wellhead is an American surface wellhead company , just for comparison..

I’ve been doing wellhead work for 17 years all over the world , so I’m pretty familiar with the different companies. But I’ve never heard of these guys.

When I worked for GE oil and gas, we had the Saudi Aramco contracts in Angola . They are a great customer .. but if there equipment failures or injuries / deaths, or the political climate gets unstable, it will void the contract . 

I’ve spent the last few years making contracts , and there’s lots of different clauses to get out of the contracts. Just fyi… Fair point. It is a little unnerving that a lot of revenue is tied up in one customer. With the clean balance sheet I’m hoping to see them discuss growth opportunities and provide clarity in the Aramco agreement. I see this as a swing trade with 2-3 month hold and stop loss at $6 if the thesis doesn’t pan out. Appreciate your input and knowledge on this No prob! It cool that you found it on oversold scanner....i stumbled upon it through IPO tracker and was rather surprised that its a company with large contracts/tiny debt and profitable. Usually you see IPO's peddle hope and dreams but OMSE seems different. Yeah, honestly felt the same - that’s why I had to do a deep dive on it. Appreciate your insights. https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/07/24/3120821/0/en/OMS-Energy-Technologies-Inc-Announces-Fiscal-Year-2025-Financial-Results.html

Earnings were inline with my expectation. Gross margins went up, which is nice to see. Good cash pile building. And nice to see they mentioned expanding customer base. FYI got 250 shares at $6.35 Better price than I got in! Nice scoop on that dip yesterday.

1m37paw,2025-07-18,"$FOMO quietly building a multi-metal play. Gold now, battery metals next?
Came across this write-up on Formation Metals (**$FOMO.CN**), and it’s kind of surprising how under-the-radar this one still is. They're kicking off drilling at their N2 Gold Project in Quebec, same belt as Wasamac, with a 2.5 km anomaly and solid early sampling. That alone would be worth tracking in this market.

But here's what caught my attention:

They’re not just chasing gold. Their portfolio also includes nickel, cobalt, rare earths, and copper, all the metals the clean energy transition is actually going to need. It’s a smallcap, yes but they’ve got exposure to multiple future-facing trends.

The stock’s been pretty quiet, but if we start to see any movement in gold or battery metals, I wouldn't be surprised if names like this get a second look.

Anyone else watching this one? Would love to hear your take if you're following Quebec juniors or critical metal explorers.

1m373w1,2025-07-18,"Antimony Ignites – $UAMY Hits All-Time Highs as $MILIF Gears Up for Breakout
# Antimony Ignites – UAMY Hits All-Time Highs as MILI Gears Up for Breakout

The critical minerals trade is heating up — and **antimony** is suddenly front and center.

With **United States Antimony Corp (NYSE:UAMY)** hitting **all-time highs today** after CEO Gary Evans appeared on **Fox Business with Maria Bartiromo**, smart money is starting to circle the very few names in North America with real leverage to the space.

But while UAMY has already made its move, **the real asymmetric setup may lie in its lesser-known peer: Military Metals ($MILI.C / $MILIF).**

Here’s why:

# 🧨 UAMY Sets the Tone

* UAMY surged to **new all-time highs** today.
* CEO Gary Evans highlighted U.S. and international **antimony sourcing efforts** for the rest of 2025.
* Company owns the **only two operating antimony smelters in North America**.
* Declared goal: become the **first fully integrated antimony producer outside of China.**
* The spotlight is on — and the market is responding.

# 💥 But MILI Might Be the Sleeper

* **Military Metals** owns **100% of the West Gore Project** — a historic **high-grade antimony-gold system** in Nova Scotia.
* Once Canada’s largest antimony mine — shut down not for geology, but **wartime disruption** (German U-boat in 1917).
* Recent news: **surface access secured**, reactivating a long-dormant national asset.
* Positioned to be one of **only a handful of North American antimony suppliers**.

# 📊 Technical Picture Looks Explosive

* Chart shows a **multi-month falling wedge** — classic bullish reversal pattern.
* Volume beginning to **creep upward** on each push — signal of smart accumulation.
* Compared to UAMY’s move, **MILI is still at base levels**, giving it room to move 3x–5x just to catch up.

# 🛡️ National Security = Strategic Premium

* Antimony is essential to:
   * Ammunition and ordnance
   * Military batteries and armor
   * Flame retardants in critical infrastructure
* China controls **80–90% of global supply** — triggering massive U.S. government concern.
* **DoD** has already funded multiple antimony-related initiatives. Expect more.

# 🔁 From Forgotten to Frontline

* $MILI was one of 2024’s top small-cap performers following its antimony pivot.
* The pullback has set the stage for a **classic consolidation + breakout** setup.
* With new visibility on the sector, momentum is shifting.

# 📍 Bottom Line

✅ UAMY’s breakout confirms the **antimony trade is real**.  
✅ MILI has **tier-1 leverage** but remains under-the-radar.  
✅ With a revived asset, rising volume, and sector tailwinds — **MILI could be next.**

[https://x.com/AllStreetsWolf/status/1946207268149543293](https://x.com/AllStreetsWolf/status/1946207268149543293)

https://preview.redd.it/jusx02ceundf1.png?width=3724&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bcb33e8e76f24519ce0c4f0d826cf6976c9af05

This is the kind of setup that turns **sleepy critical mineral plays into 5x+ winners**.
The meme potential of $MILIF is unreal! MILF? I'm in For real lol You can't bring up mili/milif without bringing up Trojarova. West gore is YEARS from getting preliminary results in, the site just defrosted like a month ago. Trojarova  will likely see the validation of the soviet site records + the results of the 13 new boreing holes on site. Once the site is validated and the PEA is finished we can work towards the rest of validation stages. I think Sept - Dec news of site validation will finish and Milif will annouce either the sale of Trojarova or dilution to finance the mining project and start PFS/FS. but honestly west gore is years from anything substantial happening

  
Edit: also to mention that EU has tons of regulation expediting approvals for mining sites. they will move faster than anything NA with how regulations are today. Good DD but as a Canadian company they are less likely to get DOD contracts or federal loans/ grants. UAMY will get that money. 

Also UAMY has plenty of room to increase share price. Just my opinion. UAMY and AREC next recipients of massive government largesse, I think. But,  diversifying is always good! hahaha facts Everyone loves a good MILF not a pennystock but if you are into antimony, look up PPTA

# The Degenerate's Guide to r/pennystocks: How to Lose Money Slightly Slower Than Everyone Else

*Had to cut this down from my original 47-page manifesto because I know you smooth-brains can't focus longer than a TikTok video. You're welcome.*

Listen up, fellow degenerates. After extensive ""research"" (scrolling through r/pennystocks while pretending to work), I've decoded the matrix of micro-cap trading. Spoiler alert: 99% of these stonks go to zero, but that's never stopped us before, has it?

# The Current Meta: AI Stocks and Quantum Hopium

Right now, every ape and their wife's boyfriend is YOLOing into AI penny stocks. SOUN pumped 350% because NVIDIA sneezed in their direction. QBTS rallied 150% WHILE UNDER FRAUD INVESTIGATION. That's right - being investigated for fraud is now bullish. We've reached peak regard.

The hot garbage everyone's buying: JTAI, MARA, KULR, RGTI. Why? Because they have ""AI"" or ""quantum"" in their description. DD complete.

# Technical Analysis for Crayon Eaters

Forget your fancy indicators. Here's what actually works in penny land:

**The Sacred Numbers**: $1.00, $2.50, $5.00. These psychological levels are like magnets for retarded money. Stock bounces off $1? Probably going up. Falls through? Welcome to Bagholdersville, population: you.

**The Panic Dip Special**: When bad news drops and everyone's selling like their hair's on fire, wait for the first green candle, then buy. Congrats, you just caught a 20-30% dead cat bounce. Sell immediately before it remembers it's dead.

**Volume or Die**: No volume = no party. If volume isn't 300% above average, you're not trading, you're donating to market makers' yacht funds.

# Position Sizing: How to Not Blow Up Your Account (Immediately)

Here's the math for you regards who failed algebra:

* **5% max** in penny stocks total (yes, that means 95% in boring boomer stocks, deal with it)
* **1-2% per YOLO** (so when it goes to zero, you only cry a little)
* **10-20% stop losses** (wider than your mom's... risk tolerance)

""But what if it moons after I stop out?"" Then you avoided joining the 90% who ride it back to zero, congrats on having a wrinkle.

# Scam Detection 101: If It Looks Like a Duck...

Remember Cynk Technology? Zero revenue, $6 billion valuation. The CEO went to federal prison but not before some true believers lost their kids' college funds.

Red flags bigger than a Chinese parade:

* ""Guaranteed returns"" (guaranteed to make you broke)
* Stock went from $30,000 to $0.10 (that's not a dip, that's a grave)
* Unsolicited DMs about ""the next Amazon"" (it's not)
* Any mention of ""reverse merger"" (translation: we're putting lipstick on this pig)

# Market Hours: When to Lose Money Most Efficiently

**9:30-10:30 AM**: The golden hour. 60% of profitable trades happen here because that's when all the overnight bagholders panic sell to you.

**11 AM-2 PM**: Lunch break. Even algos are eating tendies. Don't trade unless you enjoy 10% spreads.

**3:30-4 PM**: Power hour, aka ""trap the retail traders who just got off work"" hour.

**Friday afternoon**: When smart money goes home and leaves you holding bags all weekend.

# DD That Doesn't Suck (Rare as a Profitable Options Trade)

Real DD has:

* Actual numbers (not just rocket emojis)
* A risk section (spoiler: everything is a risk)
* Catalyst dates (so you know when you're getting rugged)
* The author's position (if they're not in it, why should you be?)

Fake DD has:

* ""Trust me bro""
* ""Short squeeze incoming!!!""
* More than 3 rocket emojis
* The phrase ""can't go tits up""

# Entry/Exit Strategy for Smooth Brains

**Getting In**:

* Wait for support bounce with volume
* First green day after 73 red days
* Some actual news that isn't ""company still exists""

**Getting Out** (the part you'll ignore):

* Sell 25-50% at +20-30% (I know, I know, ""but what if it goes to $100?"")
* Trail stops on the rest
* When volume dies, the pump dies. Don't be the last regard holding

# Your Trading Toolkit (Free Stuff Because You're Broke)

* **OTC Markets**: See which stocks are marked ""Caveat Emptor"" (Latin for ""you're fucked"")
* **SEC EDGAR**: Where companies admit they're broke in legal speak
* **TradingView**: Draw lines on charts and pretend you know what they mean
* **AutoDD**: Lets robots do your thinking (can't be worse than your picks)

# The TL;DR for Ultimate Regards

1. Never put more than 5% in penny stocks (your wife's boyfriend will thank you)
2. Take profits or become exit liquidity
3. Volume is everything - no volume = no lambos
4. If it sounds too good to be true, you're the mark
5. The first hour of trading is where dreams go to die
6. When everyone's talking about it, you're already too late

Remember: Penny stocks aren't investments, they're scratch-off lottery tickets with extra steps. The house always wins, but at least this way you get to pretend you're a trader while you lose money.

Now go forth and lose money responsibly. And when you're living in a cardboard box, at least you'll have this guide to keep you warm.

Lots of smart words here no doubt but im going to continue to regard at 60%+ of my account in quantum ai biotech pennystocks Can I get a leather bound copy of this? LMAO!! I Didn't read this but I am guessing chasing stocks...buying high selling low is the biggest reason why people lose money..

Then sadly, they were finished Oh, they scanned the page quickly for capital letters in the hopes you named a ticker for Monday, but READ it. No. They'd spend more time sending it to chat GPT and asking it to summarize it for them then just reading it lol. Good advice. My portfolio is up 56.91% YTD. Would have been more, but made a few mistakes along the way. One was holding on Envitec Biogas from 30 to 40 EUR per share only to sell it for 31. Missed opportunity. But at least I was up, while US  stocks were crashing. So started April from base of zero YTD. Then purchased some large caps like AMD. Elf, El, Meta. As you know - boring base. But good returns. Lost something on others. Lost time and energy while buying and seliing ELTP. Wasted oppurtinity, because I did not sell fast enough and bought fast enough. Now about 200 $ red on this, but still holding 7k shares of this. OTC stocks that have some profit and pipeline in the same time. Not bad. Now bought some shares of OPEN at 0.54. Bought 6k shares at 0.735, sold 2/3 at 1.1 ( I know stupid) and sold rest at 1.65. So got some profit, could be more, but I have soft hands. - stupid stop loss. Anyway. Yesterday bought IXHL for 5% of portfolio and sold 80% of it after itvreached 30% gain for the day. Could have done better, but I have soft hands again..
My next high conviction plays - ACOG, Mdai, VAPE. I have already big position in ACOG - 20% of portfolio. 5% is in VAPE. Mdai no position yet, but will be. All other in boring companies like ADOBE, AMD, Evolution AB and again Envitec biogas - now better price. So let see, where it brings me!

1m2un9n,2025-07-18,"BZAI Signed a 120M contract! TAM of 100B+!
Guys, BZAI is making the move! Disclosure: Using information and good news from the past 4 months (News Source - https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BZAI/). I condensed the information (using a little ChatGPT) and edited portions of it for correctness and clarity. This article also talks about the total addressable market (TAM) of 100B in a very unique full stack AI market and BZAI is positioning itself into taking it all!

For starters, BZAI (https://www.blaize.com/) provides purpose-built AI edge computing solutions :

* Through its proprietary Graph Streaming Processor (GSP) architecture and low-/no-code software platform. 
* It provides a \*\*full stack solution (\*\*i.e. both hardware **AND** software) focused on low-power consumption chips for AI at the hands of the user (edge computing, e.g. an AI powered coffee maker or saving lives using surgical robots).

Don't believe me? Try programming a Nvidia Jetson for AI, you'll see the trouble in decreasing power consumption while maintaining top performance. FPGA coding alone will make you run away, haha. All you VHDL/Verilog fans out there, no disrespect :). These factors alone makes BZAI **an unique and distinct edge-AI provider in the market!! None like it!**

There is so much growth here! With a **TAM(Total Addressable Market) of over** **$100B**, and the near-term revenue traction already exceeding **$170M** in announced contracts in **2025** alone! Projecting at least **10$++ by EoY 2025 and 20$ for 2026!** Perfect value for money!!

Since Jan 2025 after the pre-SPAC merger with BWI, BZAI raised over $330M from major strategic investors (e.g., DENSO, Samsung, Mercedes-Benz), Blaize targets scalable AI adoption across public infrastructure, national security, industrial IoT, and telecom.

Good post. Wish you'd posted a week ago but I'd probably have ignored it lol Sorry I don't provide financial advice. Up 100 percent in premarket. Should have told us a week ago lol, now its to late This sounds like 1999 all over again Nope, not all of it. The tables and details are, I used the each article from Yahoo news to condense all the information in ChatGPT. Always a good time to buy after a 100% run up... Is this written by AI? Up 80% overnight If people believe it's a solid company, they should buy and hold. If someone is here to make a quick buck without doing any research, there's a chance they may lose money. The fair value estimate according to Morningstar is $3.56. That probably means nothing if you believe in the company, but I wish there were more posts about assessing the fair value of penny stocks.

1m2nqke,2025-07-18,"Three Canadian Penny Stocks I'm Watching This Month
I’ve been digging into some juniors that are super cheap but have real projects and catalysts lined up. All three are preproduction explorers on TSXV/CSE, with recent news and solid teams. I’m not talking about sketchy mystery miners, these have verifiable drill results, land packages and money in the bank. Here are the three I’m most excited about right now:

  
LaFleur Minerals (CSE: LFLR)

* Mill & Land: LaFleur owns the fully permitted Beacon Gold Mill (750 tpd) in Quebec’s Abitibi, acquired from Monarch Mining. It was fully refurbished ($20M+ upgrades) and is slated to restart by early 2026. This gives them a near term production path, very rare for a penny explorer. They also control the 166 km squared Swanson Gold Project nearby (4 target zones). The Swanson deposit already has an NI 43-101 resource of 123,400 oz Au Indicated @ 1.8 g/t and 64,500 oz Inferred **@** 2.3 g/t, so there’s a decent gold inventory to build on.
* Drill/Catalysts: A 5,000 m diamond drill program is kicking off this summer on Swanson to expand resources and find new zones. Management is also planning a 100,000 t bulk sample from Swanson (to test metallurgy and start cash flow) and has an ongoing PEA for an open pit + mill scenario. With gold prices at all time highs (\~C$4,600/oz recently), any good drill hit or successful bulk sample could spark a rally. In fact, LaFleur even invited investors for a site visit in July 2025 to tour the mill and project, a fair sign they’re confident.
* Financials/Mgmt: They estimate only C$5-6M is needed to restart the mill (no debt or royalties on it), and they’ve already raised money. CEO Paul Ténière and team are experienced in Abitibi mining. LaFleur is effectively moving from explorer to near producer, a high risk move, but it makes this stock stand out for a penny stock. Upside comes from drilling success at Swanson and getting gold flowing at the mill, with very low all in cash costs once running (thanks to Quebec infrastructure).

# Trident Resources (TSXV: ROCK)

* Assets: Trident (new name for the merged Eros+MAS Gold+Rockridge) controls 100% of the Contact Lake Gold Project in the La Ronge gold belt (SK), a historic high grade camp. The old Contact Lake mine (’94-’98) produced 188,185 oz Au @ 6.16 g/t, and a late 2022 study showed 47,738 oz left unmined on that site. Adjacent is the Preview SW deposit, with a historical indicated resource of 273,000 oz @ 1.56 g/t Au and *inferred* 263,000 oz @ 1.40 g/t Au. In short, big gold numbers are already there on paper.
* Drill/Catalysts: This spring, Trident secured drill permits for a 5,000 m summer program, about 3,800 m at Contact Lake and 1,200 m at Preview SW. This is the first drilling at Contact Lake in \~30 years, so it’s a fresh start on a known deposit. Historical drill assays from Contact Lake show bonanza intercepts (e.g. 24.0 m @ 8.05 g/t, 18.3 m @ 10.41 g/t), new drilling will follow up those high grade shoots. Expect newsflow of drill results in H2/2025. If they can expand the ounces on either project, the stock could pop hard.
* Financials/Mgmt: Trident recently closed a $2.25M flow-through financing (at $0.75) and says it now has \~$10M in treasury. In other words, funding is secure for this initial drill program. CEO Jonathan Wiesblatt (ex-Falcon Gold Ventures) and team have deep Saskatchewan experience. They’ve also brought on strategic investors. This is a classic well funded high grade drill program scenario.

# Q2 Metals (TSXV: QTWO)

* Project: Q2 Metals is exploring the Cisco lithium project in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region (Québec). This is hard rock lithium, think Quebec’s newest Tesla/EV play. The project already looks massive: in 2024 they drilled a monster 347.1 m intercept averaging 1.35% Li₂O. Long, continuous spodumene zones in tier-1 Quebec = a very legit setup (and no political risk, lots of infrastructure).
* Drill/Catalysts: Q2 just reported its winter 2025 drill assays (June 10, 2025). The results are impressive: multiple wide, shallow pegmatite intercepts with strong lithium grade. For example, hole CS25-028 returned 49.4 m @ 1.33% Li₂O, and CS25-036 hit 64.3 m @ 1.34% Li₂O (that’s near the grades seen in big lithium mines). They’ve now engaged BBA Engineering to prepare an initial Exploration Target for Cisco. Upcoming catalysts include more summer drilling (mapping suggests >300 km squared land, recently expanded by 167 km squared acquisition) and eventually an updated resource and PEA. Management says they’re “taking shape as a globally significant discovery”, if that’s even half true, the stock is tiny right now.
* Financials/Mgmt: Q2 was ranked 9th on the 2025 TSX Venture 50 for share price performance (214% jump in 2024), but it’s still only trading around \~$0.60. CEO Alicia Milne is a veteran Québec lithium explorer, and the company has strong backing (investors like the Van Eck Ukraine Fund have put money in). They have enough cash for this summer’s program, and Québec’s pro mining incentives (flow through, credits) help. In short: well known management, no debt, and a huge lithium zone underway.

Bottom line: All three names above are small, pre revenue, but fully funded with real geology and drill plans. They check the boxes: solid ground positions in good jurisdictions, experienced teams, and measurable news flow coming. Q2 gives exposure to the hot lithium space in Canada. At current prices all are very cheap (pennies, as the name implies), so they’re speculative, but the upside could be huge if even one drill program hits. I’ve sized my positions to risk only a little but gain a lot. As always, DYOR, but I’ll be watching these three closely!
Interesting read, thanks! I'm leaning towards investing in Lafleur. Which one of the 3 stand out most to you? Take a look at IGO. More drill results coming soon. Management is pretty conservative on issuing PR so remains substantially undervalued. Flip a coin on LaFleur and Q2 I'd say quite the chart

1m29t1v,2025-07-17,"Uranium Stocks to Buy: Nuclear, Clean Energy, and AI $NXE $DNN $UEC $CCJ $URA
**The Age of AI Needs a Big Power Source**

Artificial intelligence is (obviously) here to stay — it’s a revolution sweeping through every sector of the global economy. It’s the next internet, in fact it’s potentially much bigger than the internet. From ChatGPT to autonomous systems, AI is transforming the way we live and work. It’s driving our cars, it’s planning our meals, vacations, giving us medical recommendations, and even helping us lose weight and quit bad habits.

But few people realize that behind every AI breakthrough lies something essential and often overlooked: **energy**.

AI models, especially large-scale ones, require **enormous computing power**, and that computing power depends on **massive amounts of reliable electricity**. As demand for data centers surges, the question isn’t just *who builds the best models* — it’s *who can power them*. And who can power them in a clean and renewable way. 

A single ChatGPT query uses roughly 0.3 watt-hours—seemingly small until multiplied by the 700 million+ queries processed daily. That adds up to over 210 megawatt-hours per day, the equivalent of powering 35,000 U.S. homes annually. And this is just one application among hundreds. AI model training and inference are pushing data center power consumption to historic highs.

By 2026, global data center energy use is projected to surpass **1,000 terawatt-hours**—more than the entire energy consumption of many industrialized nations. And AI could consume 3–4% of the world’s electricity by 2030.

In fact, you could see your electric bill rise up to 20% due to AI’s power demand increasing power costs.

In a world increasingly concerned with carbon and climate, these numbers raise a critical question: **How do we power the AI era sustainably?**

**Why Nuclear Energy Is the Answer**

The world is rapidly realizing that renewables alone cannot meet the demands of a high-tech, always-on digital economy. Wind and solar are essential—but they’re intermittent, seasonal, weather-dependent, and storage-limited. And can take up a much larger footprint compared to nuclear. 

**Nuclear energy, by contrast, offers 24/7 baseload power**. It’s carbon-free, land-efficient, and highly scalable. That makes it uniquely suited to power the AI revolution.

Tech giants are taking notice. Microsoft has invested in Helion Energy, a nuclear fusion startup, and is hiring nuclear experts for its data center strategy. Amazon Web Services and Google are also exploring modular nuclear options. These companies are preparing for a future where AI and nuclear infrastructure are intertwined.

# How AI Is Transforming Nuclear Energy

The synergy goes both ways. While AI relies on nuclear for clean power, **nuclear energy is becoming smarter and more efficient through AI**.

Advanced machine learning models are now being used to:

* Predict maintenance needs before failures occur
* Optimize fuel use and reactor efficiency
* Simulate next-generation reactor designs
* Monitor plant safety in real time using sensor networks

These AI-driven improvements lower costs, enhance safety, and accelerate innovation in a sector historically burdened by bureaucracy and capital intensity.

**The Uranium Opportunity**

With nuclear power back in favor, the spotlight naturally turns to **uranium**, the critical fuel behind most existing and planned reactors.

For over a decade, uranium prices were depressed. But that’s changing rapidly. Spot prices have more than doubled, recently breaking the $100/lb threshold for the first time since 2007. Demand is surging not just from government-backed reactors—but now potentially from **AI-powered private energy infrastructure**.

Meanwhile, the supply side is constrained. Years of mine closures and underinvestment have created a **supply-demand imbalance** that could last through 2030 and beyond.

For investors, this setup resembles classic commodity supercycles—with a twist: **AI is now part of the demand curve**.

# Uranium Stocks to Add to your Watchlist

Here are several companies and ETFs that stand out for their strategic position in the uranium value chain:

**Cameco (NYSE: CCJ)**

Cameco is the world’s largest publicly traded uranium producer, with top-tier assets in Canada’s Athabasca Basin. It also has a stake in Westinghouse Electric, giving it exposure to both fuel supply and reactor services—a rare vertical integration in this space.

**NexGen Energy (NYSE: NXE)**

A high-potential developer with the Rook I project, NexGen boasts one of the world’s richest untapped uranium deposits. While it’s pre-production, it has strong institutional support and long-term leverage to uranium prices.

**Denison Mines (NYSE: DNN)**

Denison is pushing forward with in-situ recovery technology at Wheeler River, allowing for lower-cost, lower-impact extraction. It’s a smart bet for those seeking innovation within the mining space.

**Uranium Energy Corp (NYSE: UEC)**

Based in the U.S., UEC is positioned to benefit from domestic energy security trends. It owns a large portfolio of ISR projects and could become a preferred supplier for U.S.-based nuclear expansion.

**Global X Uranium ETF (NYSE: URA)**

For broader exposure, URA offers a well-structured basket of uranium miners, nuclear tech firms, and infrastructure players benefiting from the nuclear renaissance.

**Data Snapshot: AI’s Energy Impact**

While estimates vary, the emerging consensus paints a clear picture:

* **Single AI query (ChatGPT)**: \~0.3 – 0.34 Wh
* **Estimated daily AI power use**: 210 – 240 MWh
* **Annualized usage**: \~75,000 MWh (≈ 35,000 U.S. homes)
* **Data center electricity demand**:
   * 2022: \~460 TWh
   * 2026 (projected): Over 1,000 TWh
* **Global share of electricity by 2030**: 3 – 4%

In other words, AI and data infrastructure are rapidly becoming one of the world’s largest industrial energy consumers—and will require robust, scalable solutions to keep up.

**Final Word: One Trend Powers the Other**

We’re witnessing the birth of a powerful feedback loop:

* AI needs nuclear for reliable, carbon-free energy.
* Nuclear becomes more competitive and advanced through AI.
* Uranium demand accelerates from both public and private-sector reactors.
**$**UUUU UUUU the ultimate play

1m290pi,2025-07-17,"$FOMO vs $LODE: Filling the Gaps & Reassessing the Upside
After my last post comparing $FOMO and $LODE, I got a ton of feedback, particularly about $LODE’s deeper involvement in clean tech, which honestly made me realize I didn’t give it enough credit. A few of you pointed out that $LODE owns a stake in Green Li-on, a battery recycler, but more importantly, that their main focus now is solar panel recycling, not just mining or battery refining. That alone shifts the context completely.

So I dug in more. Turns out, LODE (through Green Li-on) is not just in the recycling space, but that they’re the only certified zero landfill solar panel recycler in the U.S. That’s huge. They’ve been operating their facility for over a year and are now scaling to hit 50,000 tons of recycled panels next year. Even more interesting? They’ve inked an agreement with RWE, a massive player in global renewables, and are planning to expand even further.

That’s not all I’ve found. LODE also has exposure to renewable fuels through partial ownership in Bioleum, which is developing sustainable hydrocarbons. So yeah, LODE isn’t just a mining pivot, it’s becoming a full-stack renewables play, with real tech, real partners, and real environmental credentials.  
Now here’s where $FOMO still shines in a different lane.

$FOMO Corp. isn’t trying to own the entire supply chain. Instead, it’s executing in real-time, stacking service based ESG businesses that generate revenue now: HVAC retrofits, indoor air quality systems (IAQ), solar panel installs, and energy audits for schools, municipalities, and commercial buildings.  
The model is modular. Each acquisition brings in revenue + synergistic value:  
ESG software tools enable building owners to get compliant. 

* IAQ tech meets rising indoor air standards.   
* Solar installs reduce utility costs.   
* HVAC upgrades qualify for tax incentives.   

Most importantly, it’s operational now. $FOMO is already booking contracts, and unlike $LODE, doesn’t need massive capex or years of buildout to scale. It’s bootstrapped growth through revenue-generating services that fit directly into IRA incentives. Overall, I understand that I missed significant information and have hopefully amended that gaps in my knowledge and analysis. I appreciate all the feedback and comments, and if I am missing anything else or if there are further perspectives, I’d love to hear them.  

For my future FOMO posts, I am going to see if anyone finds something interesting about $FOMO to further deep dive into, as I am curious about what all of you have to say about it.

In this post, I have tried to compress my analysis into an essay, please let me know in case of any inputs/feedback.

On the eastern coast of India, in the port city of Paradeep, stands an industrial complex that has quietly played an outsized role in feeding the country’s farmlands for nearly four decades. From its genesis as a public sector undertaking in the 1980s to its present incarnation under private ownership, Paradeep Phosphates Ltd. (PPL) is a story of how scale, integration, and policy stability can converge into a long-term industrial asset.

# From Public Sector Roots to Private-Sector Agility

PPL’s origins were firmly within the ambit of the Government of India’s industrialization drive, aimed at securing domestic fertilizer production in a country heavily dependent on agriculture. For years, it ran as a state enterprise, manufacturing phosphatic fertilizers — primarily Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP) and NPK complexes — to meet the growing nutrient demands of Indian soils.

In 2002, a turning point arrived: the Government divested a majority stake to Zuari Maroc Phosphates Pvt. Ltd., a joint venture between the Adventz Group (India) and OCP Group (Morocco), the world’s largest phosphate exporter. This transaction brought more than just new ownership. It delivered something far more valuable in the fertilizer business — **assured raw material security**. OCP’s global phosphate mining and processing muscle, combined with Adventz’s domestic market network, meant Paradeep Phosphates now had the bones of a moat.

The transformation was not abrupt. Capacity expansions, operational efficiency drives, and product diversification happened in measured steps. By 2022, PPL would take another leap: acquiring the Goa fertilizer plant from Zuari Agro Chemicals, giving it a second coastal manufacturing base and access to western Indian markets. The company now had two strategically located plants, each feeding large consumption belts while minimizing inland freight costs.

**The Market Context: A Floor Under Demand**

Indian agriculture is an unglamorous constant in the country’s economic equation. Even as services and manufacturing gain share in GDP, the need for high and stable food production keeps nutrient demand resilient. While urea dominates nitrogen supply, policy over the last decade has sought to correct the imbalanced nutrient application that has degraded soil health in many regions. This means pushing farmers toward **balanced nutrition**, which in turn means greater use of P&K fertilizers — the very products Paradeep specializes in.

Add to this the slow but steady formalization of agri-input retail through the **Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samruddhi Kendras (PMKSKs)**, and the industry gains a more transparent, regulated last-mile network. Nano formulations — Nano Urea and Nano DAP — have entered the policy narrative too, but the rollout so far suggests coexistence rather than replacement of bulk products. Paradeep, notably, has already positioned itself with nano offerings to hedge against any structural shift in farmer adoption.

# Numbers That Whisper the Story

Between FY21 and FY24, PPL’s revenue rose from about ₹4,233 crore to over ₹8,500 crore, riding both volume gains and value per tonne improvements. This period saw global commodity volatility at historic levels, yet the company managed to navigate a dip in FY23 margins and return to double-digit EBITDA margins in FY24.

Return on equity and return on capital employed have generally stayed in the mid-to-high teens in normalized years. Debt levels have been manageable, with net debt to EBITDA trending toward sub-2x, aided by better subsidy collection cycles. The Goa plant acquisition, far from dragging resources, has integrated smoothly, adding to both volume and geographic reach.

These are not the fireworks of a high-growth tech stock. Instead, they are the steady beats of a business whose output is tied to the rhythm of the Indian crop cycle and the government’s resolve to keep farm inputs affordable.

# The Competitive Edge: Where the Moat Lies

In fertilizers, scale is not just about production capacity; it’s about **integration, sourcing, and market access**. PPL’s advantages include:

* **Raw material security** via OCP — reducing vulnerability to supply shocks.
* **Two-coast plant network** — lowering logistics costs and improving responsiveness to market demand.
* **Product diversification** — from standard DAP to complexes, TSP, and nano.
* **Backward integration projects** — ongoing sulphuric and phosphoric acid expansions to lock in margin gains.

The barriers to entry for a new player are formidable: securing raw material linkages, obtaining environmental and operational approvals for high-scale acid plants, and building a trusted dealer network under a policy-regulated price regime. This is not a market for disruptors without deep pockets and patient capital.

**The Policy Canvas: Stability with Subtle Currents**

The NBS regime has been a rare example of policy consistency in India’s subsidy-laden agriculture sector. PIB announcements over the last three years reveal a pattern: periodic rate revisions, budgetary top-ups in times of raw material stress, and targeted pushes for product diversification through nano fertilizers. The fact that the government absorbed global DAP cost spikes through a one-time extra subsidy — and then extended it — speaks volumes about its reluctance to let farmer prices rise sharply.

The single largest unknown over the next decade is the possibility of a **direct benefit transfer (DBT) to farmers** for fertilizers. Such a shift could change cash flow dynamics for manufacturers, at least during the transition. However, no implementation timetable exists today, and PPL’s integrated cost structure would give it more resilience than pure importers if it came to pass.

# The Reflexivity Loop in Action

Investor perception in commodity-linked businesses often swings more than the fundamentals. For Paradeep, the loop can work positively:

1. Good monsoon and stable crop prices improve farmer sentiment.
2. Faster dealer reordering reduces channel inventory and improves PPL’s cash cycle.
3. Management confidence rises, capital allocation to integration projects accelerates.
4. Lower costs feed back into stable margins, which markets interpret as structural improvement.
5. The stock rerates, lowering the cost of equity and allowing for further expansion.

The inverse loop — commodity spikes and subsidy delays leading to margin compression and market derating — is also possible, underscoring the need for vigilance.

# Risks and What to Watch

No long-term view is complete without risks. For PPL, the key watchpoints are:

* **Operational**: Extended plant outages or capex delays, especially the sulphuric acid expansion.
* **Regulatory**: Abrupt policy changes in NBS rates or DBT implementation without transition buffers.
* **Commodity**: Sharp, prolonged spikes in sulphur, ammonia, or phosphoric acid prices without timely subsidy adjustments.
* **Market Shift**: Nano adoption outpacing PPL’s own ramp-up.

Kill-switch indicators for the investment thesis would include multi-season margin compression without a clear policy fix, subsidy receivables consistently exceeding 180 days, or sustained market share loss in core products.

# The Price Point and the Long View

What makes this story interesting for a patient investor is not the prospect of overnight revaluation, but the confluence of:

* A business with deep structural moats in an industry where demand has a floor.
* A policy environment that, while not risk-free, has shown resilience and predictability.
* Capital allocation that has focused on integration rather than overreach.

1mlxrcz,2025-08-09,"Coal India Limited analysis
Hey guys I recently wrote a thesis for Coal India and would appreciate any feedback or your thoughts on it.

  
[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EWFQk1kwllFe4T2wFvS3fFLlPyNP0jcj/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EWFQk1kwllFe4T2wFvS3fFLlPyNP0jcj/view?usp=sharing) 
Here is the thing. Coal prices internationally are falling down a crater, and this means Coal India's margins are going to compress. In fact in the recent quarter, domestic coal was more expensive than imported coal (which is higher quality).

If coal prices do not recover globally, then e-Auction sales will not be a high margin avenue for sales and Indian companies would prefer imported coal, so Coal India will have to swallow a double whammy of lower volumes and eroding margins. All this to say, essentially Coal India looks like a commodity player, and if you want to invest in such companies you have to keep track of commodity cycles and time it properly.

Even the whole thesis of Coal India's massive capex push is actually a strategic misfire imo. A lot of countries pushed huge new coal projects seeing artificially high coal prices in 2022-2023, which led to global oversupply. We have to face the fact that all these new coal plants may be a burden if demand stays low. Even in the most recent concall, management said that there was not enough demand. Does your analysis basically mean it is good time to buy Coal India for long term ?

Btw Solid analysis (not a market veteran but depth of economics and data digging has been done good) That's lot of effort and that's the kind of posts we should encourage instead of memes. Thanks for sharing. Yeah, you raise a valid point that Coal India is exposed to commodity cycles and its difficult to ignore the recent softness in demand. However domestic coal demand is somewhat insulated compared to global trends. Also imported coal may be cheaper in the short term but supply chain costs, currency risk, and policy factors often tilt the balance back to domestic suppliers. And yes the capex push is risky, but if demand rebounds(as the projections in my thesis suggest) then Coal India will have the capacity advantage over private players. That said, yes you probably do need to watch the commodity cycle before you invest. I like the analysis, what is the source of this analysis and can i get more. Thank you, yeah I believe there is a 34% upside but hard to say when it will reach that level. I mentioned that they would be diversifying into that space so yeah I took that into account. Thank you! Yes I agree. The valuations are cheap enough to make these bets. But we should be cognizant of the risks.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/IndianStockMarket) if you have any questions or concerns.* Discount brokers are generally good, there is almost no need to go with full service brokers in this age.

Stick with Zerodha / Dhan etc. New. So Zerodha is fine.

If you get some knowledge, experience, account grows then you can think of full brokers. have you tried any of the full-service brokers ? You get these benefits from full service broker:


 Adding and withdrawing money is easy and you don’t have to wait till banking hours. They give you way more advanced tool to do research and analysis and the trading process is really smooth compared to discount brokers and as a beginner is less of a mess. 

I personally used Sharekhan 6-7 years back and it was too good. I personally liked the one tick data feature and used it for trading. 

The only drawbacks of the full service broker is the charges. This one factor is enough to choose discount broker over full service broker. if you could expand on the WHY, that would be great.. can you expand on the WHY ? what do you mean by charges ? are there any hidden charges ? what percentage (less) can i expect on a single trade ? what features do discount brokers don't have, that full-servce do ? Zerodha is simple. No confusion. Not overwhelming. Good customer care. The discount brokers charges you brokerage based on the number of trades. For example buying 100 shares and selling them will have same brokerage as buying 100000 shares and selling them. 

In case of full service broker it is based on the trade size, the more shares/amount transaction, the more brokerage you have to pay.

Regarding features as I already explained, it gives you a better and simplistic UI along with tools related to chart analysis. They also give you an RM(relationship manager) with whom you can consult and take advice/suggestions.

Most of the traders don’t need it as you can use other resources for your analysis like tradingview etc. and use only the broker to trade and not to analyse.",4,0.75,10,0,vijayin,IndianStockMarket,['AMC'],fullservice discount broker share experience hi im new trading want open demat trading account one go ones im interest hdfc securities kotak securities zerodha personally used services share experience functionality hidden charges dont mind amc long deliver good service im leaning towards hdfc sa hdfc bank better services mention general guidelines buysell oneliner portfolio review posts removed please refer faq asked questions_post_your_common common questions already answered join discord server using link 1 bot action performed automatically please contact moderators subredditmessagecomposetorindianstockmarket questions concerns discount brokers generally good almost need go full service brokers age stick zerodha dhan etc new zerodha fine get knowledge experience account grows think full brokers tried fullservice brokers get benefits full service broker adding withdrawing money easy dont wait till banking hours give way advanced tool research analysis trading process really smooth compared discount brokers beginner less mess personally used sharekhan 67 years back good personally liked one tick data feature used trading drawbacks full service broker charges one factor enough choose discount broker full service broker could expand would great expand mean charges hidden charges percentage less expect single trade features discount brokers dont fullservce zerodha simple confusion overwhelming good customer care discount brokers charges brokerage based number trades example buying 100 shares selling brokerage buying 100000 shares selling case full service broker based trade size sharesamount transaction brokerage pay regarding features already explained gives better simplistic ui along tools related chart analysis also give rmrelationship manager consult take advicesuggestions traders dont need use resources analysis like tradingview etc use broker trade analyse

1mkm16z,2025-08-08,"STT is killing trades Why double tax when STCG already exists?

Came across a Twitter post by Nithin Kamath, after which I did a little math and found that the same trade, across three segment, has three wildly different STT costs.

Taken a simple case

Stock : Reliance , Buy@ 1390 , sell @ 1400 , Qty 500 (1 lot in fno)

https://preview.redd.it/ytqyoate6qhf1.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=d04c96ce5cff5e5a29ba9a190918eac34bf7ecfc

Delivery STT is **8x** intraday STT.

STT was introduced in 2004 to replace the short-term capital gains tax.  
Now we pay **both STCG + STT**  isn’t that just **tax on tax**?

If SEBI actually wants more retail participation, lowering STT  should be the first step.

What do you think outdated relic or a necessary evil?
Absolutely.

STT was introduced since LTCG was exempt.

Now we have LTCG + increased STT.

So now we pay STT on every transaction; even loss making ones; in addition to a host of other government.

And then LTCG / STCG without indexation benefit if we are in profit.

This is tax terrorism at its finest. in the last 5/7 years

LTCG tax increased

STCG tax increased

Indexation benefits reduced

Debt mutual fund benefits closed

Dividend tax introduced

Gold tax increased

played with NPS rules

have done everything to ensure taxes are burdened on us and bail out ladki bahins. Governments & baboons don't want you to earn. They still have typical colonial hangover. worst is no one is questioning, no one is coming out on streets

opposition also have so many low hanging fruits but they are focused on how to give 100% reservation Let this ethanol blending issue settle.

1mixddo,2025-08-06,"SBI Securities opened a Demat account without informing me? ₹588 deducted without consent
Hey everyone,
I recently turned 18 and opened a regular savings account at SBI. Yesterday,someone from the bank called and asked me to visit the branch. I assumed it was for some final formalities, so I didn’t question it much.

When I went there, the staff told me to download an app called SBI Securities and asked me to log in. Then they made me do some small trading activity. I didn’t question it at the time because I thought it was just another app like YONO – something that’s part of their internal process. I'm not into trading at the moment (don’t even have the funds for it), so I honestly didn’t think much about it.

Later that day(5 aug), I checked my transaction history and noticed ₹96 was deducted — which the bank staff had mentioned during the process, so that was fine.

But to my shock, I also saw a ₹588 deduction on 1st August under the name SBI Securities Cap. I had opened my savings account on 28th July,
I'm getting spam emails from sbi securities also from that day!

I did some digging and found out this was the Annual Maintenance Charge (AMC) for a Demat account, which was opened without my consent or knowledge. I was never informed that a trading or Demat account was being created, let alone that I’d be charged for it(yearly?)

Now I’m stuck. I’m not even trading currently, yet they opened an account in my name, made some initial trades on my behalf just to “activate” things, and deducted ₹588.

Even my father was confused when I explained what happened — and honestly, I feel dumb and taken advantage of. I trusted the staff, they seemed helpful, but now I’m wondering if this is some kind of routine upselling they’re doing to meet targets — without customer consent.

Is this a known issue? Has anyone else experienced this with SBI or other banks?
What should I do next?

Should I confront the branch in person?

Is it worth trying to pause the account instead of closing it entirely? I might want to trade in the future.

Can I get a refund for the ₹588 AMC?


I’d really appreciate some advice. Feeling quite frustrated and unsure of what steps to take. Thanks in advance.

Give a written complaint about that employee to the branch manager and get acknowledgement details about the complaint. This is such a dishonest move by SBI. You should raise a complaint against them. Nobody can open your demat account let alone deduct AMC without even informing you. You forgot to follow up after a month. Just complain to RBI and see them begging you to take the complaint back. I visit a SBI branch to deposit one time and they told to wait to get OTP, I asked why then they said it's for feedback for cash deposit, due to their stupid server I didn't get any OTP and there is a long queue, so I told them later will do this and left the branch and now I getting to know why they want otp... Then I started to deposit in CDM ATM machines only First complain online over call or email. Wait for the response. If you get a favourable response well and good. If you think you didn't receive any resolution. Raise the complaint with the RBI ombudsman after 30.days of initial complaints. See them coming behind you. I emailed the helpdesk, didn't received any good response then i talked to this sbi securities person whom i alloted to assist, he told me that this is the one time payment and all? Is that even true? He told me that you will never gonna be charged again?

And without consent thing, he told me to talk to the branch as he can't talk abt this!
Wht should i do? Go to the branch and confront them?

Or just raise the complaint directly? Cause literally they didn't even tell me anything abt thiss

I can't let them go that easily? Should i talk to the branch first directly or just for the complain? I knew that..

It's literally feels like a scam lol.. Okay thanks

1mhzjwq,2025-08-05,"Industry Analysis: Asset Management Company
By [Pai](https://pranavyad.substack.com/)

This post covers the Asset Management industry in India. It can be of **value for Equity Investors** looking to invest in AMC stocks and this report can be a first step into understanding what to look for in a good AMC

https://preview.redd.it/j3fhojrtm4hf1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3c9dbfda4a46e09788a2395580157118c0dc982b

# Industry Analysis - Lay of the Land

# 1. Industry Map & Profit Pool

* From the industry map of Capital Markets, some things become quite clear.
   * 1. The **major share of revenue and profit pools** in the capital market ecosystem is taken by AMCs.
      * This is good news as it means the land is not dry and is worthy of further exploration in order to find a good investing opportunity.
   * 2. **High ROCEs and OPMs**
      * further great signs for the industry when compared to other industries in the ecosystem. It is an **asset light** industry where major costs are employee costs while manufacturing costs are zero. That’s beautiful, as we are saved from the worry of raw material volatility. While employing low capital, these businesses can generate massive profits. It’s a beautiful business to own at the surface level.

# 2. A bit about AMCs

# How do AMCs make money?

* Companies charge a **fee** for managing funds called an expense ratio. In India, TER also contains distributor fees, but at least 50% flows down to the AMCs and we call this the yield for the fund. Indian AMCs garner yields of .4-.5% on average, higher than their global peers, major reason being low passive fund share as of now.

# Growth Story & Trends Observed (hindsight)

* The 10-year CAGR (FY15→FY25) in AUM has been **≈ 20.5 %**. That's an exceptional run-rate over such a time period. Except for the covid induced drop in 2020, growth has been more or less steady. It’s tough to see an inflection point in this journey since the industry has been growing around 20% cagr since 2005.
* **Categories Leading the Charge:** In the last 5 years, growth has been led by Equity and Passive funds, showing CAGRs of \~30% and \~36% respectively. These categories have been gaining more of the AUM pie at the expense of debt oriented schemes.

* **SIP Inflows:** Inflows via SIP have been increasing at the rate of \~26% for the last 8 years, with SIP AUM reaching 20% of total AUM. The adoption of SIPs among retail investors has been a major reason for the growth of the industry.

# 3. Market Share Analysis

* Instability & Concentration
   * Well, an asset light industry with great return ratios and profit margins does attract competition. The industry has at least 40 AMCs however the top **7-8 control 70-80%** of the market share. What’s interesting is this industry can further be studied in sub parts based on the asset they invest in - equity funds and debt funds are the major categories which can be further divided into active and passive funds. It’s important to understand the industry at this level because equity funds yields > debt fund yields and active fund yields > passive fund yields.
   * Indian AMCs yields are usually .4-.5% of AUM which showcases an important aspect of the industry. **Economies of scale** play a huge role as yields are miniscule. However these miniscule yields applied to massive funds under management yield handsome profits for the companies, \~50% of which are usually passed down to shareholders.

* We classify AMC industry as **Growing**
   * due to the double digit growth seen in the last 20 years and the potential runway for more growth

* **Force 1: Threat of New Entrants**
   * Not anyone can go open up an AMC tomorrow. It is a capital intensive task which also takes regulatory approvals. With that said, as seen with the Jio-Blackrock JV, powerful players (strong sponsors) can and will want to enter this growing and lucrative business
   * Entry rates are roughly 1 per year while 75% survival rate is seen. Most exits happen via acquisitions rather than market failure.
   * **Barriers To Entry**
      * High level of Capital required, the strength of established brands and customer loyalty, access to distribution channels, economies of scale, the costs of switching from one supplier to another, and government regulations.
   * In a growing industry on the verge of some stability, it’s phase where entrants are being seen especially as other players in Capital Markets try to horizontally integrate into AMC business as well as powerhouses choosing to enter the industry.
   * Overall: **Moderate to High.** A powerful player which can perform well has the ability to disrupt the market share and force margin pressure as switching costs are low.
   * However medium term outlook remains higher as it’s a growing industry and new entrants are expected
   * Longer term, we will notice consolidation and powerful players taking a bigger chunk of the pie and probably a lower risk of new entrants.
   * What this means - AMCs either have to be nimble or stick to their guns and follow a long term strategy to survive this medium turn competitive intensity.
* **Force 2: Rivalry Among Existing Firms**
   * Weapons of rivalry include pricing, service offerings, new products, advertising, and promotional spending. There’s been a gradual decline in TER indicating MF trying to compete on pricing as the competition intensifies, however prominent reasons for this can also be regulatory changes and the general rise of passive funds. New products are on the rise and advertising has been a combined effort of the industry. All these factors indicate intense rivalry among the AMC as of this phase of industry growth.
   * Overall: **Moderate to High.** AMCs need to form their competitive strategies to avoid direct competition and try to capture niches.
* **Force 3: Bargaining Power of Suppliers**
   * Suppliers for AMCs can be RTAs, Custodians, Index Licensors. I would argue that even though some of the suppliers form duopolies, they don’t have much power to increase input costs for the AMCs.
   * Overall : **Low to Moderate**, not an area of concern for AMCs for now
* **Force 4: Bargaining Power of Buyers**
   * Buyers, especially the new direct-fintech ones, are aware of product offerings, have low switching costs (and in fact some are too short term), fragmented when it comes to retail, and are very performance oriented.
   * Overall - **Moderate to High**, trending upwards towards High as Buyer Knowledge keeps increasing. What this means is that it very important for AMCs to offer differentiated products and most importantly either have a good trusted brand image or a sustained performance track record (often the two go hand in hand)
* **Force 5: Threat of Substitutes**
   * Let’s first look at some of the substitutes available to the buyers. DIY stock investing, model portfolio, PMF/AIF, ULIPs, other investment category products like FD, Gold, Bitcoin (cryptos). I would argue that in the long term and overlooking temporary fads, mutual fund products will have a strong presence and although some buyers might pivot to high risk, more demanding products like DIY investing or cryptos, most will stick to Mutual Funds especially on realizations of market cycles and the drawdowns during break markets. The Low Volatility of Mutual Funds is a great feature for the busy individual who can’t devote a lot of time to wealth creation but still knows that he deserves more returns than offered by FDs.
   * Overall **Low to Moderate**. There are substitutes for certain segments of the buyer like HNIs & financial-literate, but mutual funds will keep a stronghold in the game. They might pivot to more passive nature and start offering alternate funds nonetheless as can be seen in more stable markets like the US

# 3. Disruption and Disintegration

https://preview.redd.it/izeubpmqn4hf1.png?width=1378&format=png&auto=webp&s=5242edb3edd368da0d53b2376bad2e120ea2edbf

>

* Disruptive Innovation
   * Innovations currently seen in the industry have been more **sustaining** than disruptive, offerings new and new versions of the product. Currently the industry doesn't seem to be tackling any disruptive innovation with GEN AI as well not seeming to impact the industry as such. More disruptions are being seen in the feeder industry of MF distributors where fintech platforms offering Direct DIY MF investing seem to be cutting MF distributors completely out of the game as fast as retail customers are concerned.

# Part 3: Summary & Future Outlook

**Summary** : An attractive industry in its growth phase has been attracting new players. Although we already see concentration such that the top 20% AMCs control 70-80% funds. Threat of new entrants are moderate/high and we’ve seen new entrants in terms of players doing horizontal integration and big players also entering the industry, although new offerings are more and more trending on the passive side.

**Outlook:** The future looks bright for the industry with still some runway left in the medium to long term. However, the future might consist of

* shrinking yields,
* the shift to passive funds,
* initial competitive intensity followed by consolidation via acquisitions and
* the ability of future winners to focus on niches, staying nimble but still focusing on their long term strategy rather than getting too caught up in the investment fad of the moment.

US slaps 25% tariffs on our exports. Rupee chilling near ₹88. FPIs pulling out faster than retail traders after a red candle.

Nifty has been falling for five straight weeks, but “experts” say a reversal is coming on Aug 8. Yeah, sure.

Autos & metals are up, IT stocks are still in ICU. Jefferies says “neutral” now, so… still meh.

IPO mania: NSDL oversubscribed 41×, JSW Cement wants ₹3,600 crore. Listing gains gang still alive and kicking.

SEBI vs Jane Street drama unfolding, $560M frozen, “reforms” incoming. Finfluencers already typing new “safe” option strategies.

So… are we actually in trouble, or is this just another episode of “India Bulls Through Everything”?


Tariffs? Rupee crash? FPI exodus?  
Cool. Wake me up when we stop oversubscribing IPOs like free biryani. How much cash are you sitting on then? And how much % of your portfolio is shorted stocks and indices ? Market goes through a normal bullish day: Markets are solid, we are independent, retailers and dii are supporting.

Market goes through a normal bearish day: Oh my god Trump Tariffs, War, India Rupee is the worst.

Just relax and keep on investing and trading. If market is to go 0, stock market will be the last thing you care about. ![gif](giphy|gjxrPwCHWkXrWgYNua|downsized) Markets in the short term is always like a casino. Feel yourself lucky ? - go buy a single stock. >Nifty has been falling for five straight weeks, but “experts” say a reversal is coming on Aug 8. Yeah, sure.

Like todays stocks... That you have to buy today. These were predicted on 8 August 2025.
Or I will be posting regulars from today till Friday this week. Anything. To get some idea. I tried to add more but it distorts the columns so I have to take screen shots. And only these parts I was able to do. Here we see only profit but in next I have shared other parts as well. Where there is a collective loss as well.

Also empty target reason means Either Target got hit or stoploss. At current I have used the days CLOSE\_PRICE as entry and target or 4 weeks later close as exit.

Capital Used - 6.5L 

Returns = -40k (-6.1%)

Definitely a bad month. Most of the losses were contributed by booking losses on a single investment in Triveni Eng.

Definitely should've had a tighter Sl. But even apart from this investment it was a bad month because firstly Nifty closed in red in all 4 weeks of the month.

And my trading skills aren't at the level I'll like them to be to trade effectively in a consolidating market.

Have been trying option selling on paper trade and I am starting to get an idea. Will definitely  start it with real money post my university exams.

My exams are till Sept mid so execution will be compromised in Aug and Sept. Let's see how it goes.

Link to my trade log for the month - [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mCDhh3hxrFJBmrxYy2h5tDcBHn1Vq-HV8GbIw2uzb-k/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mCDhh3hxrFJBmrxYy2h5tDcBHn1Vq-HV8GbIw2uzb-k/edit?usp=sharing)
Yea, very difficult month. SLs were hitting left right center. I was able to turn around about 4 trades which hit full profit target so my net is still positive but not as good as I would have liked

Oh your r in options with loss...got it Bro,  focus on long term investing. Trading is very difficult NIce post im also learning how swing trading works and how should i do the investment and learn it these real world example with full details like (ur portfolio sheet, ur time line) helps me to understand many things.   
Thank you buddy :D So be it. But I love the process of trading and I am gonna master it. For trading, sl is variable based on the support levels i think from where price can rebound. If the supports get broken I then I am out.

For investing I like to take a more fundamental sl than a technical sl. Triveni announced a bad q1 results so I exited it after that. But that clearly isn't working.

I find medium term investing in way more difficult than short term trading. There are too many variable that can affect a stock in 1-2 year period. Its a full time job. You cant expect to earn serious money without putting 12-14 everyday. Are you prepared to do that? Most people get into trading because they think its easier to understand, unlike investing. And you get instant profits. People on this subreddit dont want to inderstand this. Bro that's too less, I mean the profit or loss will be miniscule. This was just a bearish month so I couldn't could trade that well. 

I've been swing trading since 2 years so I am comfortable with this position sizing.

1mgcoha,2025-08-03,"Have a doubt regarding MF folio
If I have an ongoing MF folio with a broker and want to directly invest through AMC. Should I make a new folio as in register for a new folio or use the ongoing folio number to invest directly bypassing the broker?

You can try mfcentral . If not, then keeping all in demat is the only option i think

First things first apologies for kinda click-baity heading, you can't win here as there's nothing to win at, you can just perform(better or worse) in comparison to others or instruments for a given period of time.

So let's get to that, how can one perform better than something they're taking as a benchmark for example most commonly used, major indices like Nifty 50 or Bank Nifty or maybe comparing with any trader/investor like warren buffet (sounds silly but beating his returns on huge capital is phenomenal given for such long duration).

Performing better requires one and only one thing : **Edge.**

Thing that most people don't understand and delve directly into psychology and stuff and all kinda stupid stuff out there, also paying hefty amount for it sometimes in scammy stuff. They need to understand that all they need is a Edge first and everything comes later(as you eventually keep building it from the foundation of your edge), you need to have a proven Edge first.

Now what's an edge over markets might be a logical question, that is what I'll try to layout using this post, it's the main essence of it. 

So Edge over markets means anything(Literally anything ,can also be a coin flip, if that works for you) that can help you perform consistently better in large sample set of similar scenarios when they play out, this simply means you can reap profits overtime applying that same thing again and again over a huge set of scenarios. Now you have to gain so much from this edge, that you can beat the benchmark that you've decided for yourself for a considerable amount of time in order to outperform it. 

Now depending on where you are in your life, or where you want to be you can choose or build your edge overtime to consistently perform better in markets. Let's explore some of the edges out there to get an idea of how wild can these things be.

These are out of retail domain usually : 

1. **You're Literally an insider of a company(Higher level decision making people)** : Time and time again insiders have gained from the info others are not yet aware of, this is nothing new it has been happening since the capitalism has happened, also it's one of the biggest edge out there, but illegal on paper (but people usually find ways hehe). This is the edge in purest form, kinda formidable if you know what you're doing. Know insiders and getting tips might help but it always does not turn out for the best in such cases.

2. **You're an operator in a stock :** So basically you've got a shit load of money and you're trying to manipulate stock without getting noticed or get ready for some action hahaha, it's an edge though and happens more often than not so.

3. **Quant Firm :** If you have fastest and reliable data with internet connection along side the smartest brains and math wizs who you pay so heavily to work for you 70 hours a week churning out algos and systems, well you are in to make shit ton of money eventually if you do not blow up due to a tiny mistake. 

4. **Hedge Fund or Private Equity :** You have a loads of money to manage and you take a huge cut just to keep that money from degrading, huge network for high net worth individuals pooling their money and giving it to you for you to manage, then maybe that's your edge to get good paydays. 

5. **Using drones to spy on Oil reserves and such stuff :** Self explanatory. 

And many more these kinda complicated formations, you get the drift right?

Now coming to retail division :

5. **You thew a dart** : So you've picked some 50 companies randomly and thew a dart at them and then maybe you got luck and beat the shit out of all benchmarks, highly rare and literally not recommended but can happen. Most retail do this. Also an edge if you're feeling like your luck is out of this world.

  
6. **You go YOLO options**(Even with knowledge) :  Pretty much the above one, but you'll lose your money so fast your head will start spinning and you'll be scared to look at your yearly PnL at the year end. You'll sleep good after a huge loss(personal experience, only If it was not the loan money). But some times people go on lucky streak and make money doing this, so that's an edge in that case that is your luck, just runnnnn when this happens, you don't go back to casino after you've cleared out the table.

And many more variations of this here and there you know..

Now that we've got rid of major things that would often not pan out for us then what's left for us? Let look at that :

7. **Fundamental analysis/ Value Investing**: Branch of investing/Trading that says if you can read the company statements well and all it's ongoing available stuff in news, concalls and stuff you can beat the benchmark overtime. So basically it can work for you but there's very few people who are this good at this in a long term horizon, sometimes I call it gambling if you're not knowing what you're doing and just doing half assed work to bind your money and sit for 10 years to find your that most of what you've bought got delisted or is halved.

So how people who do it efficiently work it out?

They have cornerstones to it, that might include : 

\-Right Diversification 

\-Attending/reading concalls, presentations asking right questions 

\-Have put in a slight thought on what future might look like for this company 

\-Finding objective evidences of that future happening  

\-Tracking quarterly data of company along with developing good skills at reading them

\-Might help if you can meet with promotors and have talks about future(Not for everyone)

\-Having strong instinct about something that you've expertise in and betting right amount and sit tight until everything above seems right

\-Trying it's products and getting a sense for yourself if it feels right according to your instincts on how they can grow 

\-Patience and ability to let it grow without having the dependence on the money you've put in, till your vision plays out

These are a few that I've read and experienced myself, there are gonna be more. Maybe add to it on comments? if you're this kinda Investor/Trader.

 Most people are under this perception that you have sit out for years or decades to make profit from this kinda edge, but they can't be more wrong. 

If your vision for a company plays out in a year and stock goes 10X-15X you need to know when to get out, specially if it comes very early. That's a skill that people develop overtime how to judge where we at and how are things looking forward given the current situation and its quite critical skill to develop.

Let's take a example : lets say a XYZ company trades at 100 Cr Market cap and you think this company has a exceptional product that'll mint money, you invest in it. You think that it's easy for this company to reach 2000-3000 Cr valuation in future when everything goes right for it. But some miracle happens and it reaches a valuation of 1500 Cr in just 10 months due to extraordinary scaling and boom in industry. Now you have two options 

1. Take out your major stake and leave some to see if it can go any further. As your vision has nearly played out. It's the most logical step here. Also given that the move was so rapid that it might need some time to digest some gains.

2. Being someone who thinks it can go much more cause you're greedy, but if you have some empirical evidence to back the further growth it's fine to be in it, but if not and you're just acting out on greed then it's gonna ramp down your edge significantly.

There can be multiple such scenarios that can play out, as a user of this edge you've to build competence in this areas to gain a edge overtime, also experience helps alongside good books.

As this post would get huge if I include more stuff here, will keep it for next one. If I feel people need a further post like this based on their reactions I would love to jot down the stuff in next post.

1mfgk7e,2025-08-02,"Data Centers to Become Largest Consumers of Renewable Energy in India
The country's data center capacity is expected to grow exponentially from 1.4 gigawatts in 2024 to 9 gigawatts by 2030. Currently, data centers account for approximately 2% of the country's total energy demand, but this figure is projected to rise dramatically to 6% by 2030. To put this in perspective, an average data center consumes as much power as an aluminum smelter or the equivalent of 100,000 homes. 

The artificial intelligence revolution is adding another layer of complexity to this energy equation. A single ChatGPT query uses 2.9 watt-hours of electricity compared to 0.3 watt-hours for a Google search. Goldman Sachs Research projects that AI will increase data center power consumption by 200 TWh annually between 2023 and 2030, with AI accounting for about 19% of data center power demand by 2028.

The transition to renewable energy in India's data center sector represents one of the most significant green energy opportunities in the country. The Yotta NM1 data center near Mumbai, India's largest, already gets half of its power from renewables with a target of reaching 70%. 

Despite the promising opportunities, the path to renewable energy dominance in data centers faces substantial obstacles. The intermittent nature of renewable power generation requires expensive storage solutions, creating a significant financial burden for operators. 

Infrastructure challenges are particularly acute. Power reliability varies significantly across India, with frequent disturbances forcing data centers to rely on expensive diesel generators and uninterruptible power supplies, substantially increasing operational costs. 

Electricity tariffs, including fixed charges in metropolitan areas, are among the highest in India, making power one of the biggest cost burdens for data centers.

India's hot climate increases cooling demands, making it difficult to maintain global efficiency standards for Power Usage Effectiveness. Cooling accounts for approximately 40% of a data center's electricity demand.

The massive scale of energy demand creates grid integration challenges that could undermine the renewable energy transition. Clustering of data centers in major hubs will further strain local power networks, given their enormous energy consumption.

The trajectory toward renewable energy dominance in India's data center sector appears inevitable. The market size of data centers is projected to reach 8 GW by 2025, requiring 20 GW of solar power for data centers by 2030. This represents an opportunity to create almost 12 GW of renewable and storage capacities.

The expansion beyond tier-I cities to emerging markets like Kochi, Jaipur, Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Patna, and Visakhapatnam will create new opportunities for renewable energy deployment.

https://preview.redd.it/rdx9gd931jgf1.jpg?width=945&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c726c1680a738548c777740e099f8b40815b6fe


This is both exciting and a bit concerning. On one hand, it’s great to see India’s data center growth aligning with renewable energy goals 9 GW by 2030 is massive. The fact that facilities like Yotta NM1 are already halfway powered by renewables is definitely a step in the right direction.

But the challenges are real. The infrastructure gap, unreliable power supply, high cooling demands, and insane tariffs in metro areas could slow things down. Plus, with AI blowing up energy consumption (didn’t realize a single ChatGPT query eats up 10x the power of a Google search), we’re heading into serious demand territory.

The idea of data centers becoming the biggest consumers of green energy in India is both a huge opportunity and a logistical headache. We’ll need smart grid upgrades, localized storage, and probably a major policy push to make it sustainable.

Still if we pull this off, it could turn India into a global hub for sustainable digital infrastructure. Let’s just hope the execution keeps up with the ambition. Are there any listed cooling companies in India which would get a boost from data center expansion? You can check techno electric and engineering Most infra and real estate companies are getting into this business. And companies like Castrol are getting into data center cooling business.

1mf1vts,2025-08-01,"Tanla Platforms: What's the bigger picture and the stagnant share price?
Tanla Platforms is a major player in the Communications Platform as a Service (CPaaS) sector, particularly in India.

Pros:

1. Almost 0 debt (2.8% debt equity ratio)

2. Good ROE of 28%

3. Promoter holding marginally increased from 43% to 45% over the past few quarters

4. The company's median sales growth is 26.8% over the last 10 years

Tanla is a leading CPaaS provider, dominating the market for Application-to-Person (A2P) messaging in India. It processes a significant portion of the country's A2P SMS traffic, with a market share of around 35-40%.

The company has evolved from a bulk SMS provider to a comprehensive cloud communications company. Its key product portfolio includes:

* **Trubloq:** A blockchain-based platform for Digital Ledger Technology (DLT) that is designed to combat spam and fraud in the telecom industry. It is cited as the world's largest blockchain use case.
* **Wisely:** A patented cloud communication platform built in partnership with Microsoft Azure, offering secure, real-time communication.

Tanla serves over 2,000 enterprise customers, including major players in technology (Google, Meta), e-commerce (Flipkart, Amazon), banking (HDFC, SBI), and telecom (Airtel, Jio).

While its core market is India, Tanla is actively expanding its international presence with offices in Singapore and Dubai and partnerships in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.

The company is focusing on new technologies like Rich Communication Services (RCS) and AI-driven communication solutions, such as its ""Wise Albert"" platform.

Analyst forecasts and a company-sponsored report project revenue and net income growth in the low double-digits (around 11-13%) over the next three years. This is a solid, albeit not explosive, growth rate

Despite all the pros, the company's share price is below 20 DMA and below 50 DMA. What's the view for long-term? Worth buying some shares now? Or avoid?
It has a very debatable moat.
RCS is kinda an old tech, especially for foreign countries and couldn’t justify the ROI in past.  

I don’t see any explosive future for it. I like the stock.

https://preview.redd.it/pipj4jiw0ggf1.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f014f75d3b663cd3457cd3ebe83f55339f6b34d I have been following the Cpass industry for a long time. At the core they make money buy sending sms basically by buying bulk sms from telecom providers and helping the enterprises send the sms to target groups. This was a great model in the past but started having challenges recently.

1. Enterprises see sms as a old format where the communication is one sided and there is no interaction.

2. Failure of RCS. even though RCS has rich format where you can send media and links for interaction it costs more.

3. Final nail in the coffin. Meta started offering their enterprise bundle where the companies can send messages on WhatsApp which has more interactive features ( think of whatsapp banking thats how advanced it is) at a fraction of the cost.

I agree the cpass players have some clients for whatsapp advertising also but most are going directly to meta for their offerings cutting the middle man. Given all these challenges the future is not so optimistic. So there is a derating in PE from 100 to 20.

1me5mvp,2025-07-31,"JLR CEO resigns (Tata Motors)
So the CEO of Tata Motors’s subsidiary JLR will step down amid tariff disruptions to JLR business. 

Notable that Tata Motors is planning to acquire IVECO and will have two subsidiary businesses to turn around—one each in PV and CV segments after the demerger. 

I’m aware that there’s a passionate voice on the worthlessness of Tata Motors as a company on this sub; the analysis is not entirely wrong but I am also confident that in the very long run, the companies formed from the demerger will be good companies or will be acquired by good names. 

No investment advice, just a newbie expressing confidence in a brand in doldrums :)

 
They could have waited until the deleveraging played out completely. Their cash position was definitely improving. But I don't think, going forward with something like swallowing a whole company while having sales and tariff issues is a good idea.

1mdx86a,2025-07-31,"First try at Analysing a Company | Tata Motors
# Tata Motors: Q1 FY26 Earnings Preview - A Research Report

Date: July 31, 2025  
Rating: Hold  
Tenure: long term  
Short-Term trend: bearish  
Target Price: Rs 775 - 830

**Key Hypothesis:** Tata Motors' Q1 FY26 earnings are expected to reflect a challenging quarter primarily due to softer global wholesales, partially offset by strategic focus on higher-margin models (especially JLR) and a resilient domestic EV segment. While profitability may see a contraction YoY, the long-term outlook remains supported by EV growth initiatives and cost optimization efforts.

# 1. Sales Performance Overview (Q1 FY26 vs. Q1 FY25)

|Metric|Q1 FY26 (Units)|Q1 FY25 (Units)|YoY Change (%)|Remarks|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Total Global Wholesales**|2,99,664|3,29,292|\-9%|Overall volume contraction globally.|
|**Domestic Sales**|2,03,411|2,26,012|\-10%|Reflects subdued demand in the Indian market.|
|**Passenger Vehicles (incl. EVs)**|1,24,809|1,38,677|\-10%|Despite overall decline, EV sales show late-quarter momentum. New launches like Tiago (up 16% YoY) and Altroz/Harrier-EV are positive.|
|**Commercial Vehicles**|85,606|91,048|\-6%|Modest decline in the commercial segment.|
|**JLR Wholesales**|87,286|98,060|\-11%|Volume drop, but a strategy shift towards higher-margin models is crucial.|
|**Jaguar Wholesales**|2,339|N/A|N/A|Specific decline for Jaguar, indicating ongoing model transitions.|
|**Land Rover Wholesales**|84,947|N/A|N/A|Land Rover remains the dominant segment within JLR.|
|**JLR Retail Sales (incl. China JV)**|94,420|111,260|\-15.1%|Larger retail sales decline compared to wholesales for JLR.|

**Hypothesis:** The notable decline in overall wholesales, particularly in domestic and JLR segments, is expected to be a primary drag on top-line growth. However, strategic moves within JLR to prioritize higher-margin models (like Range Rover, comprising 77.2% of wholesales vs. 67.8% YoY) are anticipated to provide some cushion against the volume decline, preventing a steeper revenue drop.

# 2. Expected Financial Metrics (Q1 FY26 Projections)

|Financial Metric|Projection (Q1 FY26)|YoY Change (%)|Underlying Rationale / Drivers|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Revenue**|Rs 1,00,000-1,05,000 crore|\-5% to -8%|Despite a 9% drop in global volumes, JLR's enhanced product mix (higher ASPs, especially in the Range Rover family) and improved regional performance in some markets (e.g., MENA +20.5%, China +1%) are expected to partially offset the volume impact, leading to a less severe revenue decline.|
|**Net Profit**|Rs 4,000-5,500 crore|\-10% to -20%|Lower sales volumes directly translate to reduced profitability. Additionally, elevated material costs (estimated at \~68% of expenses) are likely to compress margins. The full impact of volume contraction will be felt here.|
|**EBITDA Margin**|11-12%|Down \~350 bps|This projection factors in estimated EBITDA margins for JLR at \~11.4%, which is supported by an 8% sequential rise in Average Selling Prices (ASPs). While JLR's performance is a bright spot, the overall decline in sales and persistent cost pressures across the board are expected to drag down the consolidated EBITDA margin significantly compared to the prior year.|
|**EPS**|Rs 10-14|N/A|Directly linked to the net profit outlook. A lower profit base will naturally lead to a reduced EPS.|

**Hypothesis:** While revenue decline is expected to be managed somewhat by JLR's premium strategy, the impact on the bottom line (Net Profit and EBITDA margins) will be more pronounced. This suggests that despite efforts, the current quarter faces significant headwinds from both volume and cost perspectives.

# 3. Potential Influences & Risks

|Category|Factor|Impact Direction|Explanation|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Positive Catalysts**|Growth in Electric Vehicles (EVs)|Positive|Tata Motors' aggressive push for EV penetration (aiming for 30% by FY30) is a key long-term growth driver. While Q1 FY26 EV sales are part of a declining PV segment, the momentum towards quarter-end suggests potential for improved performance in subsequent quarters, contingent on continued consumer adoption and product pipeline strength.|
||Cost-Takeout Measures|Positive|Ongoing internal cost optimization initiatives across all segments could provide a buffer against rising material costs and contribute to margin improvement over time. Any positive updates on this front would be welcome.|
||Regional Gains (e.g., MENA, China)|Positive|Strong performance in specific international markets (MENA up 20.5%, China up 1% for JLR) highlights diversified revenue streams and could partially mitigate weakness in core markets.|
|**Headwinds / Risks**|Subdued Indian Demand|Negative|Macroeconomic factors such as persistent inflation and unpredictable monsoon patterns could continue to dampen consumer sentiment and spending on discretionary items like vehicles, impacting domestic sales volumes.|
||Global Economic Slowdowns (EU/US)|Negative|Economic contractions or slowdowns in key international markets (Europe, the US) could further impact JLR's performance and overall global wholesales.|
||Debt Levels (Post-Iveco Acquisition)|Negative|The proposed $4.5 billion Iveco acquisition raises concerns about increased debt burden, potentially impacting the company's financial flexibility and interest expenses in the future. Investors will be keenly watching for updates on this front and its potential implications.|
||Operating Leverage from New Facilities|Mixed|While new facilities can lead to economies of scale and efficiency in the long run, in the short term, they might incur initial costs and underutilization if demand remains subdued, impacting profitability.|
||JLR Model Transitions|Mixed|The ongoing phasing out of legacy Jaguar models is a necessary strategic move, but it can temporarily impact volume. The success of new model introductions and their ramp-up will be crucial to offset this.|

**Hypothesis:** While Tata Motors has strategic avenues for long-term growth (EVs, JLR's premium focus), the immediate quarter faces a challenging demand environment both domestically and globally. The market will be looking for clear commentary on cost control, debt management (especially related to the Iveco deal), and the outlook for key segments like EVs and JLR's new model pipeline to assess future trajectory.

Before anybody mentions: Yes, I did use AI & Grammarly to improve the data presentation and language, but data accumulation, hypothesis formation, and analysis were done by me.

\> Please suggest if you think I can improve this in any way. I would appreciate it if you could guide me instead of criticising, as I am learning. I want to understand if I misunderstood the data, left something out of the picture, or formed a premature bias against the stock/company.

Also, I am not an advisor in any way, so take everything with a spoonful of salt. I am just a guy with a laptop and a curious mind.
The analysis has fundamental flaws. You should first focus on analysing the industry structure before screening the stocks. 

Second, compare it with not only domestic peers but also the international peers and their growth rates to figure out whether it’s a value buy or trap. 

Key Financial parameters like ROCE, Margins profile whether its expanding or not  should be observed and rate of reinvestment should be monitored. 

Revenue profile, Moat structures, erosion of their EV advantages in India all are getting reflected in financial language of company. 

So avoid this company even at these multiples because long term they will give less than 10% for the next decade on any financial model.


You will learn this as you develop your knowledge base, because No AI will be able to help you figure out these patterns. 

Learn through books, the use AI as a tool, but don’t depend on it to screen or analyse the stocks. *Please suggest if you think I can improve this in any way. I would appreciate it if you could guide me instead of criticising, as I am learning.*

Don't use AI in the beginning. If you use, you cannot develop own analysis. Thank you for the insightful review. I will make a mental note of this.

1mdsfhb,2025-07-31,"India shall take tough stance on Tariffs against USA. It has nothing to loose.
India should analyse How USA based companies generating profits from India!


* By banning global giants like Alibaba, PDD, Tencent, Huawei, TikTok so on, India gave monopoly access to USA based tech giants like Amazon, Meta, Apple.

* USA companies like Nike, Crocs, Levi’s, Sketchers so on importing goods from China and selling in India. Out of this profit goes to their USA shareholders. Who will account this trade deficit?

* Companies like McDonalds, Domino’s, Pizza hut, Burger King so on imports many ingredients from other countries than USA. That they feeding Indian consumers. Out of that they making profits. Who will account this trade deficit?


If Trump is counting then India shall also account “USA specific companies Import to India from other than USA countries “!
Even flipkart is owned by Walmart. US sellers in India are required to establish and Indian entity and pay taxes to the indian government - federal, state, and local. 

Indians companies like Jubiliant foodworks, hardcastle, connaught, yum foods, and devyani run Dominos, Mcd, and KFC franchises in India. The same applies to Coke and Pepsi. It's never a one way street. 

You may now get back to seething and coping. We have our IT service industry to loose, our major export to US is not goods but service, which is more than 100bn dollar...IF EU also aligned with US, than definitely pressure can be created on USA... Let's start by banning these US tech companies but first create an alternative? Or let indian entrepreneurs thrive. That would be massive boost in economy. Most importantly indian subsidiaries of these US tech giants. Those are responsible for high salaries. Indian tech companies used to pay peanuts 10 years ago. Trump is doing the right thing. BRICS should accelerate cooperation between asia and the global south. BRICScoin can unleash the potential of 70% of global workforce. If our IT companies are banned from doing business with US, imagine the effect on jobs here. What if they ban OUR software companies next? Food companies use local ingredients. Food imports are prohibitively expensive. 

Apparel manufacturers use a mix of Indian, SE asian, and Bangladesh goods. 

Yes, they send profits back to their US HQ.

If you think that's a problem, wait until every nation does this to India. Say good bye to IT, petrochem, pharma, textiles, engineering goods. 

Please pick up a newspaper and read consistently for months, and you will realize we live in shitty market and there are largely 2 reasons behind retail participation being high: a. high fees and duties to send money abroad, b. mindless SIP investing. Due to my employment, I invest in shares on NASDAQ and the growth is tremendous. Nothing on the BSE/NSE matches that.

India sucks at trade because of its lack of quality goods, policies, and logistics. It should take accountability and improve itself instead of hating and blaming others. Exactly. IT is already in crisis. Add this to turmoil. You'll create a Army of unemployed youth even the skilled youths will go jobless.

1mc1vfd,2025-07-29,"So what's going on with this stock (ISWL)
I'm an amateur so this might be a stupid question so forgive me in advance.

Someone I know purchased stocks in ISWL some months ago on the recommendation of a stock market analyser. They've asked me to help them understand this stocks behaviour.

For the past ~10 days Indian Steel Works LTD (BSE) has been hitting and staying at upper circuitfor the full day. I haven't been able to find any significant news in the past 3 weeks on Google that would justify the stock price rising so much so rapidly. From what I can understand the company financials aren't so great either. Looking at the market depth, 25 orders driving 850k shares at maximum price also feels odd, especially considering that there are 0 sell orders.

Is my speculation correct that this stock price is being artificially inflated for a possible pump and dump bid? My friend wants to sell away his shares but a mutual of ours told him to wait a bit and see if he can squeeze out a bit more profit out of it. I feel like it's risky, since we don't exactly know what direction this stock will take at what time. Plus, this stock is also under SEBI watch of some sort so I'm concerned that they might stop the trade if suspicious activity is found, and my friend will lose his money.

Thank you in advance.

1may3kd,2025-07-27,"18.5% LTCG incoming
The recently proposed legislation aims to augment the long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax levied on limited liability partnerships (LLPs) from 12.5% to 18.5%, employing the alternative minimum tax (AMT). This provision directly impacts the following entities: Family offices Promoter holding firms LLPs utilized as investment vehicles These structures were meticulously designed to optimize tax compliance. However, this proposed change may render these strategies obsolete. The primary objective of this legislation is not tax planning; rather, it serves as a measure to mitigate potential tax liabilities.

1m9n67w,2025-07-26,"How I gradually made 1-Lakh ( 100% ) profit out of iPO Shuffling.
In this screenshot I have shown how I gradually made 100% profit out of IPO in 1-year from June-2023 to may-2024 in Retail segment.

Later I stopped because of low allotment chances, more demat AC requirements & funds were diverted.

🚴started june-23 under 'company name' you can see i Invested in these 28 in 1 year. Used to skip the one which I didn't felt confident.

📊 The Strategy was simple I new that in retail segment oversubscription wouldn't exceed 4-7x, if (GMP is 20-50%)
(Issue size 500-800cr) & (Shares offered is 35%). On an average i used to apply with 5-7 demat AC, 2 A/c were mine others are of my friends I used to give them funds to invest in IPOs in return I provided them fixed commission pretty cool deal.

💸In further columns those are Gain & loss. Losses were small profits were huge. Under investment column those are the maximum investment which I made per IPO. Used to invest heavily where oversubscription were 100%. Beside it I have noted some data points of every IPO later on i stopped reporting it.


🔥In the month of Nov i made almost 45k. Tata tech was purely luck based 😅 wasn't expected, booked 170% gains. After that every Indian flocked to IPO markets IREDA,TATA were making headlines. Even on a decent IPO oversubscriptions in retail segments were going crazy 8-12X whereas HNI category was normal. Allotment chances got harder and harder to counter that I planned to add more no. Of demat A/c. But that also didn't worked coz
 subscription went 15-18x. Me and our traders friends were eagerly waiting for that 1 bad IPO.   So these new entrants could get a lesson.

🥳Nonetheless I made 1.30 L  from IPO shuffling & another 15k from investments leftover in IPO stock later sold at profit. Around 20k invested.

Feel free to ask anything...!

Wait how can you apply with two Demat Acs, applying with two Demat accounts in your name doesn't get you subscription moreover it is a Fraud u/s 447 as in Section 38 of the companies Act 2013
Making multiple Applications to increase chance of IPO is a Fraud.
And everyone who abets you in making Multiple Applications is also guilty of fraud.
Not a good decision to put this on Social Media
Though applying in IPOs I don't consider it a flex 😂 Oh, absolutely! Because of him, I missed out on every IPO allotment and watched him rake in the profits like a lottery winner! Ah, I see. I don't understand how OP received allotments on applying 2 applications using his own demat. The registrar would have (should have) rejected both applications because the rule is one PAN, one application in applying for issues. 🥲 mine means family member ,sister bro. We hv a separate portfolio of parent company stocks for IPO 😅

1m4ku8s,2025-07-20,"ITC Hotel Update: Hits New All-Time High, Framework Wins Again

Reposting the original which was shared before the demerger** The strategy yielded close to 50% returns in 6-9m. 

The framework is not limited to ITC and parameters are applicable to any demerger scenario.  



**The Demerger Framework and How To Apply it on ITC.**

# This Investing strategy has generated a 30.8%compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over 17 years for Joel Greenblatt.

* (Index S&P 500 gave a CAGR of 9.5% during that period)

It was Designed by **Joel Greenblatt** and mentioned in his book **""You Can Be A Stock Market Genius""** 

The Demerger Framework.

**Major reasons why companies pursue Demerger and how to benefit from them**

* **To unlock hidden value that is otherwise not recognised** by the market when the company is viewed as a conglomerate.**(ITC’s hotel business has been overshadowed by the company’s larger FMCG and paperboard businesses. By demerging the hotel business, ITC will allow the market to re-evaluate the value of this segment independently.This could lead to the hotel business being undervalued at first, because institutional investors who are focused on FMCG or other sectors may sell off the stock.)**
* **The parent company can  better allocate capital to its most profitable segments**, improving its overall capital efficiency and profitability.\*\*(\*\*After the hotel business is demerged, ITC will be able to focus more on its FMCG,Smoke, paperboard, and packaging segments, which are  higher-margin and less capital-intensive compared to the hotel business.**This could allow ITC to allocate capital more efficiently and potentially increase the profitability of its remaining divisions**.)
* By spinning off a business, both the **parent company and the new company can focus on what they do best**.When a business is freed from large corporate parent, entrepreneurial forces are unleashed in the new division .This can lead to better performance and greater growth potential for both businesses.
* To appeal to a more specific group of investors.The parent company may attract investors interested in more mature, stable businesses, while the spinoff may attract those looking for faster growth or higher risk.
* **Tax, antitrust, regulatory Issue(ITC demerger is not not based on this)**

**You don't need special formulas or mathematical models to make money from spinoff. You just need to exploit the fundamental issues.**

**Two Critical Elements of this Framework .**

\- I**nstitutions dont want the spinoff  and  Insider want the spinoff.**

**Institutions don't want the spinoff and reduce stake in new company** (They have structural reasons for that and it has nothing to do with the companies fundamentals)

* Spinoff companies are much smaller than parent companies, this makes the size of new business too small for an institutional portfolio, which only contain companies with much larger market capitalisations.
* Many funds(Large cap funds, index funds and etf) can only own shares of companies included in Nifty and Sensex. **So the new division will be subject to huge amount of indiscriminate selling.This gives us the opportunity to pick up shares as a lower price after the spinoff.**
* **Acc to Penn State Study, the largest stock gains for spinoff company comes not in the first year but 2nd year. It may take a full year or 15-20% decline for the initial selling pressure to wear off before the spinoff stock can perform at its best(This is a 30 year study that was focused only on spinoffs)**

**Insiders want the spinoff and have stake in the new company** (This reflect that the parent company believes that their will be growth and value creation for them in this new company, in several cases parent company  don't hold any stake in the spinoff company which is a big red flag)

* **ITC will maintain a 40% ownership of ITC Hotels, with ITC shareholders acquiring the remaining 60% in proportion to their stake in the parent entity)So the second condition is already fulfilled.**

So with a bit of logic, common sense and experience we can exploit the situation and make money. Its has already declared that ITC will have 40% stake and now if the selling happens by institutions in first few months, both the criteria will be fulfilled and it will be an opportunity to allocate some capital.

I **have used this strategy on Danaher spinoff of Verlato in 2023 and it worked. The stock got listed on $84 went to $68in next few months AND currently trading at $102.**

**Same is happening with Raymond spin off right now** although I haven't checked whether Raymond has insider stake in Raymond lisfestyle.

So have Patience and Wait and see whether the stock is following similar pattern and **apply it only for spinoffs from high quality company which have good management.**

It's a bit complicated framework which I have tired to explain in a more simplified version, I hope you find it valuable.

If anyone wants to go into details of this framework ,you can **read chapter 3 of Joel Greenblatt book ""You Can Be A Stock Market genius.""**

Happy Investing!
[deleted] You should wait now, because the movement has happened. 
You will get opportunity in next 6m, because once the framework starts working, there is a phase of selling after reaching ATH, before the next upward movement.

So stay calm and no Fomo. 

You can **align it with the margin framework and checklist** for future growth potential. 

The demerger frameworks has played out, now future growth will depend on margin expansions and reinvestment rates. Well, im having some profits, do you think its okay to book those profits, what your view on the current price, would it be okay to say that it still have some gas left, before profit booking happens.

1m1ztph,2025-07-17,"SEBI proposes to shift gold and silver ETF valuation to domestic spot prices !!
ETFs used to be calculated London gold prices + some calculations (currency, duty, premium).

Now SEBI wants all AMCs to use **Indian spot prices** (like MCX/IBJA) to value gold & silver.  
Cleaner, simpler, more better accurate.

Why this drama? Gold ETF inflows just hit ₹2,000+ Cr in June and SEBI wants everyone on the same page.
this is the biggest shit sebi has come again with...we track 24hrs gold price now using the london exchange and along with gold price rise we also gain when rupee falls against dollar...this will destroy the returns common man is making and it will make them exit the gold etf's..and put back money in equities..the only reason sebi is bringing this change This makes no sense. Even if there is disparity in Indian price and london price for a day or two the price will eventually become the same as gold is a global commodity. Do you guys not understand arbitrage?

Half blind are truly leading the blind in this sub and with a lot of upvotes too. This is their goal

1m12txx,2025-07-16,"Day 6: The Tata Stock Behind EVs, OTT & Med Devices

**This is Day 6 of my “30 Days, 30 Stocks series, where I break down one company each day using a sharp, checklist-based framework.**

**Last Pick( Day 5)**: Shilchar Technologies. 


**Tata Elxsi: Stock Analysis Using Checklist Framework**

**Market Cap:** 39,723 Cr (Mid Cap)

**Moat is moderate in nature.** It’s built on niche technological specialisation, high switching costs, Tata branding, which gives them a strong networking effect and execution legacy.

**ROCE: FY25 was 36%, and the historical ROCE range is 45–50%**. ROCE is still high and reflects strong capital efficiency, but the declining profile needs to be monitored. **AI investments and billing slowdown due to automation can be a major reason so this needs to be tracked.**

**Margin: FY25 OPM: 26%, almost at par with their long-term range of 25–30%**. Margins have reduced from 2022 levels but are still very strong and healthy.

**Product profile is strong because it operates in a niche ecosystem.**

* **Embedded Product Design (EPD)** **60–65% of revenue**.This vertical has long-term secular growth because it helps in Autonomous mobility and EV ecosystem.
* **UX/UI services (OTT , telecom, connected devices).15%**.This vertical can see major AI disruption.
* **Healthcare segment:10%**, which can be a major growth vertical because of MedTech innovations.

**The company has strong secular tailwinds, but AI risk should be adjusted for when valuing this business model.**

**Revenue:**

* **Long-term revenue CAGR (FY19–FY25) was 14.93%**, but those growth rates have collapsed. **From FY23 to FY25, the revenue CAGR is just 8.87%. Growth slowdown was because of a high base effect and structural changes happening in the IT industry.**
* **Client concentration is high: the top five clients contribute 45% to the revenue profile, which is again a risk to growth rates.**
* **AI risk is real in its OTT/UI/UX business because some design work may get commoditised.**

**EPS growth**

* **FY19–FY25: 18%; historical growth (FY15–FY25): 23%. Since 2023, EPS growth is less than 5%.**
* We can already see that EPS growth rates have plateaued (EPS in 2023 was 114, and in 2025, it is around 120). **Growth rates have compressed a lot and can be early signs of an AI automation threat to the whole industry.**

**Valuations:**

* **PE of 53 (expensive)**. In 2022, PE was 110 and now it has compressed to 53. EPS moved from 81 to 120, but because of compression of multiples, the stock is in plateau mode and has given negative returns since 2022.
* **Fair value on multiples is 30–35,** because we have to factor in the AI threat to their UI/UX vertical, which contributes 10–15% to revenue. So, after adjusting for compression and moderate growth, the **fair value is around the 4,000 - 4,500 range**. FIIs and DIIs already have a high allocation, so no tailwinds in share price from that vertical.

**Compression pattern** :
Always look at these patterns and integrate it with growth rates, market caps and size of revenue. 

**Never pay 70–90 PE for single-digit growth or low double digit growth**. Even if EPS grows at 15–20%, multiple compression kills returns and the stock can stay flat for 3–5 years. That is exactly what is happening with Dmart, Asian Paints, and most of Saurabh Mukherjea’s portfolio.

He can do all the marketing he wants to sound intellectual and attract investors, **but the lesson is simple: when you overpay, you risk a lost decade. So avoid the mistake of paying any price for quality.**

# The compression framework spares no theme, and defence stocks will face it too in the next 1–2 years.

**Capital Intensity:** **Asset-light business model, so high FCF gets generated.**

**Balance Sheet: Funded all growth from internal cash. No debt and no dilution of shareholders**. The cash reserves are improving because of an asset-light, FCF-positive model.

**Pricing Power: Strong in ADAS, medical and telecom verticals**. **Niche specialisation gives them a moderate to high degree of pricing power.**

**Reinvestment: The biggest reinvestment opportunities are in EV tech and ADAS because the TAM is huge.** MedTech can be another high-growth vertical because global OEMs are shifting to outsourced models.

**Cyclicality**: Moderate because of the diversified revenue stream. **The automobile vertical is more sensitive to economic cycles, but the healthcare segment helps balance that cycle.**

**Economies of Scale: Scale advantages are moderate in nature and support the operating-margin profile.**

**Promoters: Tata Group: 43.91%**. FII and retail holdings have come down slightly, and DII holdings have gone up.

**Conclusion**

Tata Elxsi **score high** on the quality checklist, but the **valuation is not cheap**, and the stock is **priced for perfection**. 

Even after compression, **the current price has factored in the growth of the next 1–2 years**. If growth rates don’t improve in the next 2–3 quarters, it can trigger a derating,  which will be an opportunity to build your position. **It’s a high-quality company, but don’t overpay more than 30–35 PE.**

**In case you missed it:**

Thank you for reading and being part of this journey. If you found it useful, feel free to share it with others who might benefit.

The checklist framework and mental models used for this analysis are archived on r/IndiaGrowthStocks. All time high around 10,300. It’s down 38% from its ATH, so now 61% is needed just to get the ATH back which they made in 2022.

Although Fair value is around 4500. Is LTTS a good alternative to elxsi? The growth rates are at par with Elxsi and its trading at 36 multiples but one needs to go through their product profile and moat structure before making any final call. 

I will cover it in detail but looking at the financial language, Tata Elxi at 45-50 is at par with LTTS at 36 because of superior margin profile and higher ROCE. Okay,  will go through them and if I find anything of high quality or filled with red flags I will definitely include them. good post 3500 on financial language and patterns or PE of 30. You can integrate it with technical parameters and future deep dive

1ly4rok,2025-07-12,"My current portfolio
This is my current portfolio that I have been adding onto since the last 3 years. Overall % is low since I keep adding on to few stocks over time. 

Asian paints is just there for me to try and get any minor gains in the shorter term if possible.

Muthoot finance has been on this account for a while and I'm just riding the overall wave in this segment. 

My overall portfolio is financial sector heavy because I feel there is a long driveway of growth which is still yet to be observed.

Will hold the the 4 (Except Asian Paints) for the longer term and add more once the price gets more attractive.

Asian paints mein bhut zyada problems chalre hai. Thoda study karo usko ( you are literally exposed 40% to Asian paints, toh you should know )
