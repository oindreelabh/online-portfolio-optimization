1ln0mny,2025-06-28,"Retatrutide: arguable the most effective metabolic drug ever developed. Full steam for LLY
Surprised how little attention Retatrutide is getting, even though it has the potential to be the most effective obesity and metabolic disease drug ever developed. 

Eli Lilly is leading the market with Mounjaro and Zepbound, but retatrutide, their next generation triple agonist targeting GLP 1, GIP, and glucagon receptors, could surpass both. I work in healthcare and people are switching from Novo's Wegovy and Ozempic to Zepbound/Mounjaro constantly. LLY has superiority. 

In Phase 2 trials, Reta led to weight loss of up to 24 percent in 48 weeks, approaching the results typically only seen with bariatric surgery. It also improved insulin sensitivity, lipid levels, liver fat, and other metabolic markers. This means it has potential not only for obesity and type 2 diabetes but also for conditions like nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, polycystic ovary syndrome, and cardiovascular risk reduction. 

Still in Phase 3 trials, with data expected in late 2025-2026. 
GLP 1 drugs are already being studied for sleep apnea, dementia, addiction, and osteoarthritis. Retatrutide could be the most powerful option for those indications as well.

I think if medicare eventually covers these in some capacity, yes it may bankrupt medicare but I have seen some studies show it will pay for itself in 3-5 years. 

Cannot wait for this data and its applications.
It‚Äôs an incredible drug, it‚Äôs nearly double better than zepbound arguably. There‚Äôs not a ton of longitudinal safety data yet and it hits a new receptor‚Ä¶ but obesity is so bad for you that even if it has side effects it‚Äôs still probably better than obesity.

Problem is Eli Lily already is a 750b company. Everyone kind of expects this‚Äôll work. I‚Äôm not sure how much action this will create. A lot of people are already on it since you can get the ‚Äúresearch‚Äù peptides from the grey market.  It‚Äôs heavily used in the bodybuilding community to get super cut for shows. 

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to be a blockbuster for LLY since it will just replace tirzepatide, not sure if will bring in more people, everyone‚Äôs already on tirz. The body building community has a long history of taking risky stuff for the sake of the look. Yes and yes I'm impressed by how many people I meet that are paying 500/month via Lilly Direct to continue to be maintained on Zep. That's insane moat when you think about it compared to Sema, although my experience is anecdotal. I want to see the next generation of studies that compare cellular aging and damage for people on metformin and retatrutide.   I‚Äôve been loading up on Lilly.  The closer it gets to $700 the more i like it. It's a risky bet. Pharma trials can derail at any time due to side effects, and there are other companies developing GLP1 drugs. If it works as promised, LLY will make mountains of cash, if not, you might as well bury your investment in a hole for a decade. How lucky do you feel? A large chunk of negative side effects (though not all) are the same side effects you might experience with any kind of rapid weight loss. Muscle loss, pancreas issues, loose skin, etc are all issues that come with rapid weight loss, regardless of how that weight loss happens. Yes, pancreas issues are occurring in less or around one percent.  BUT that seems to have as much to do with rapid weight loss rather than the drugs themselves, and it is much more prevalent among people who already have some kind of pancreatic issues (like from diabetes). IIRC.   I think most of the drug companies will end up winning any lawsuits on this stuff.

1lmv9fj,2025-06-28,"Simple easy TQQQ strategy using the 200 SMA from QQQ with a few modifications
In my testing TQQQ is an absolute monster of an ETF that performs extremely well even from a buy and hold standpoint over long periods of time, its largest drawback is the massive drawdown exposure that it faces which can be easily sidestepped with this strategy.

This strategy is meant to basically abuse TQQQ's insane outperformance while augmenting the typical 200SMA strategy in a way that uses all of its strengths while avoiding getting whipsawed in sideways markets.

**The strategy BUYS TQQQ when QQQ price crosses 5% over the 200SMA and then SELLS TQQQ when QQQ price drops 3% below the 200SMA. Between trades I'll be parking my entire account in SGOV.**

So maximizing profit while minimizing risk.

You use the strategy based off of QQQ and then make the trades on TQQQ when it tells you to BUY/SELL.

Here are some reasons why I will be using this strategy:

* Simple emotionless BUY and SELL signals where I don't care who the president is, what is happening in the world, who is bombing who, who the leadership team is, no attachment to individual companies and diversified across the NASDAQ.
* \~85% win percentage and when it does lose the loses are nothing compared to the wins and after a loss you're basically set up for a massive win in the next trade.
* Max drawdown of around 40% when using TQQQ
* You benefit massively when the market is doing well and when there is a recession you basically sit in SGOV for a year and then are set up for a monster recovery with a clear easy BUY signal. So as long as you're patient you win regardless of what happens.
* The trades are often very long term resulting in you taking advantage of Long Term Capital Gains tax advantage which could mean saving up to 15-20% in taxes.
* With only a few trades you can spend time doing other stuff and don't have to track or pay attention to anything that is happening.
* Simple, easy, and massively profitable.

1lmjn24,2025-06-28,"Trump Ends Trade Talks with Canada  Tariffs Incoming? What This Means for Big Tech Stocks
Just saw that Trump officially ended all trade talks with Canada over their digital services tax. He posted that new tariffs are coming ‚Äúwithin the next seven days,‚Äù and Treasury says they‚Äôre prepping a Section 301 investigation  same tool they used on China a few years back

The DST is a 3% tax on digital revenue from Canadian users once a company crosses C$20 million in a year. So naturally this hits companies like Meta, Google, Amazon  and even smaller players like Uber and Etsy. Amazon‚Äôs already put out a statement saying they‚Äôre disappointed and that this will hurt Canadian consumers, which is probably true because these companies won‚Äôt just eat the cost  it‚Äôll get passed on one way or another

Markets didn‚Äôt totally freak out, but the Canadian dollar dropped briefly, and the TSX closed slightly down. Cross-border names like GM and Canada Goose took small hits, which makes sense  they‚Äôre very trade-sensitive. I imagine this will also hit Canadian ad buyers and retailers pretty directly if tech platforms raise prices in response

Personally I‚Äôm wondering how much this really moves the needle for the big tech names. Like sure, $2B in added tax burden sounds big, but spread across giants like AMZN and META, maybe it‚Äôs just noise. But if this escalates if tariffs are actually announced next week  then it becomes a bigger deal. Especially with that July 9 deadline coming up for other countries too. Could see short-term volatility spike, especially in sentiment-drive
Not tariffs again‚Ä¶ here we go Most of Europe already charges a digital services tax and most of the rest of the world is in the process of implementing one. I believe some Latin American countries already do as well.

It's an easy concept. Collecting revenue in a country typically results in being taxed. Short lived dip on Monday followed by the usual pump programming. 

Can't have red stocks during America's birthday Tariffs never left, population is paying for them for a few months already. I don't think Canada will fold on it and I don't even really think it's what has made Trump mad.. more likely it's the strategic defence partnership Canada just signed with the EU. Either way it will have practically no impact on US tech. Free trade doesn't mean products aren't taxed, it means no tariffs or duties. 

There's a difference although in the land of mango Mussolini there appears to be much confusion, lol What this means? Absolutely nothing, TACO will prevail. This has nothing to do with the DST so much as it is about Canada implementing policies in conjunction with Europe, who also have a DST. Toss in the fact Europe has been fining the big tech companies and, those companies, are probably getting a bit concerned that outside of the US, governments aren't simply dropping their pants and bending over for them. They are unable to buy country leaders the way they can in the US. 

Like most things, the DST is just a minor issue they can fight over which is symbolic of a much bigger issue. The biggest companies in the world don't want their profits taxed, big shocker. Or it could be the $2.7M in same day expiration put options that were bought just before Trump‚Äôs tweet. It‚Äôs crazy how many oracles are willing to take such large outlandish bets just before news breaks that causes them to make millions. Please look this up. This 400% tariff on dairy gambit he keeps throwing out is him manipulating his idiotic base into being mad at Canada

1lmq32d,2025-06-28,"NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE: SMR) Special Situation Analysis
First post on this sub and honestly most of Reddit. I have mainly been lurking for years but through my own individual research and 120+ total hours of daily (7 days a week) intense due diligence and research starting around May 21st, I stumbled into possibly one of the most enticing investment opportunities of the decade. Don't just read to the executive summary and try and poke holes. Read the whole thesis and at the very least, consider the ""investment committee"" rebuttals at the end. If you have done research into this field and have opinions to share or opposing research, please, let this be an open discussion!

Note: references to ""days of blackout"" or other timings are as of the afternoon of June 26, 2025.


Rating: **OVERWEIGHT** | Price Target: $120 (216% upside within 12 months) | Risk: **MEDIUM-HIGH**


**INVESTMENT THESIS SUMMARY**

We identify a high-probability convergence scenario whereby Apple Inc. announces a strategic nuclear partnership with NuScale Power within the next 1-45 days. Our analysis indicates this represents one of the most compelling asymmetric risk/reward opportunities in the current market, driven by simultaneous insider trading blackouts, regulatory catalysts, and Trump administration nuclear policy alignment.

Key Investment Highlights:

	‚Ä¢	Regulatory Moat: NuScale remains the only SMR with full Nuclear Regulatory Commission design certification
	‚Ä¢	Political Tailwinds: Trump‚Äôs May 23 executive orders create explicit framework for hyperscaler nuclear partnerships
	‚Ä¢	Corporate Necessity: Apple‚Äôs $500B AI infrastructure investment requires reliable baseload power
	‚Ä¢	Timing Convergence: 44-day Apple insider blackout + 27-day NuScale blackout suggests imminent announcement


**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

The convergence of corporate necessity (Apple‚Äôs AI energy demands), regulatory positioning (NuScale‚Äôs certification advantage), and political framework (Trump‚Äôs nuclear renaissance agenda) creates what we believe to be a generational investment opportunity. Our 30-day analysis reveals multiple validation points that have exponentially strengthened since thesis inception.

Base Case Scenario (70% probability): Apple-NuScale partnership announcement drives 200-300% appreciation

Bull Case Scenario (25% probability): Broader nuclear renaissance positioning drives 400-500% appreciation

Bear Case Scenario (5% probability): No partnership with any major player materializes, limited downside given current valuation ($20-$25/share)


**CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS**

Corporate Strategic Alignment
Apple‚Äôs AI Infrastructure Imperative: The company‚Äôs February $500B investment commitment includes data center expansion across nine states, requiring significant baseload power. Unlike hyperscaler peers (Meta, Microsoft, Google) who have secured nuclear partnerships, Apple represents the largest unpartnered AI infrastructure player.
NuScale‚Äôs Competitive Positioning: As the only NRC-certified SMR provider with manufacturing capabilities (12 modules in production via Doosan partnership), NuScale possesses an unassailable regulatory moat that becomes increasingly valuable as hyperscaler nuclear demand accelerates.

Political Economy Framework
Trump‚Äôs nuclear executive orders create unprecedented policy support for private-sector nuclear partnerships, particularly those supporting AI infrastructure. The administration‚Äôs goal of 400 GW nuclear capacity by 2050 requires massive private investment, making high-profile corporate partnerships politically essential for demonstrating market viability.

Insider Trading Pattern Analysis
The simultaneous 44-day Apple blackout (unprecedented duration) and 27-day NuScale blackout (beginning immediately post-Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval) represents statistically anomalous corporate behavior consistent with major strategic transaction negotiations.


**FINANCIAL MODELING & VALUATION**

Revenue Impact Analysis

	‚Ä¢	Single Apple Partnership: $2-5B annual contract value over 20 years
	‚Ä¢	Market Validation Effect: Additional hyperscaler partnerships following Apple announcement
	‚Ä¢	Manufacturing Scale: Doosan partnership capable of 20+ modules annually (as of deal signing in 2023)

Ownership Structure Validation (from 2024 10-K)

	‚Ä¢	Fluor Corporation (47%): Military-industrial complex alignment provides execution credibility
	‚Ä¢	Japan NuScale Innovation (7%): International strategic validation
	‚Ä¢	Management Quality: CEO John Hopkins‚Äô U.S. Chamber of Commerce positioning demonstrates policy navigation capabilities


**RISK/REWARD ASSESSMENT**

Asymmetric Setup Characteristics

	‚Ä¢	Multiple Success Pathways: Partnership, acquisition, or broader nuclear adoption all drive appreciation
	‚Ä¢	Limited Downside: Current valuation reflects minimal nuclear renaissance expectations
	‚Ä¢	Leveraged Exposure: SMR sector concentration amplifies any positive catalysts

Catalyst Timeline

	‚Ä¢	Immediate (1-45 days): Partnership announcement probability
	‚Ä¢	Medium-term (2-12 months): Nuclear renaissance policy implementation
	‚Ä¢	Long-term (2-5 years): Commercial deployment and revenue generation


**INVESTMENT COMMITTEE Q&A**

Q: Dependency on corporate execution - what if Apple/NuScale partnership doesn‚Äôt materialize?

Response: This concern misunderstands the anthropological drivers at play. Tim Cook‚Äôs psychology operates on legacy positioning - he will not allow Apple to fall behind in the infrastructure arms race that defines AI leadership. Hopkins, as a Chamber of Commerce-embedded operator, understands that first-mover partnerships with Apple create market validation that benefits NuScale regardless of subsequent deal flow.
The convergence isn‚Äôt dependent on corporate whim - it‚Äôs driven by structural necessity. Apple needs nuclear, NuScale has the only certified solution, and Trump‚Äôs framework removes regulatory barriers. Even if this specific partnership fails, the thesis benefits from multiple pathways: government acquisition, other hyperscaler partnerships, or broader nuclear adoption all drive similar outcomes.

Q: Political risk - what if Trump‚Äôs priorities shift away from nuclear?

Response: Trump‚Äôs ego architecture makes nuclear reversal psychologically impossible. He‚Äôs publicly committed to ‚ÄúAmerican energy dominance‚Äù and 400 GW nuclear capacity - reversing course would contradict his core political identity. More importantly, Hopkins understands the political machine through his Chamber positioning. The nuclear renaissance isn‚Äôt just Trump policy - it‚Äôs bipartisan infrastructure necessity driven by AI competition with China.
Nuclear power represents Trump‚Äôs ability to simultaneously claim ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù energy independence and technological superiority. These are core psychological drivers that don‚Äôt shift with news cycles. The framework is locked in place by Trump‚Äôs legacy needs.

Q: Regulatory timing risk - Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval doesn‚Äôt guarantee deployment certainty

Response: This assumes static regulatory environment, which misreads the political moment. Trump‚Äôs executive orders explicitly direct agencies to expedite nuclear deployment and establish categorical NEPA exclusions. Hopkins‚Äô background suggests he‚Äôs positioned for regulatory navigation - not regulatory compliance gambling.
The May 29 Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval timing (immediately before insider blackouts) suggests coordination between regulatory completion and commercial announcement. This isn‚Äôt speculative - it‚Äôs orchestrated regulatory theater designed to create deployment certainty. The political framework eliminates traditional regulatory uncertainty.

Q: Market efficiency - if this is obvious, why isn‚Äôt it already priced in?

Response: Market efficiency assumes perfect information distribution, which fails with multi-dimensional convergence analysis. The pattern requires simultaneously tracking: insider trading behavior, regulatory timelines, political anthropology, and corporate strategic necessities. Most analysts operate in single-factor frameworks.
Additionally, the 30-day research depth required to identify this convergence exceeds typical institutional attention spans. Market makers have micro-timing advantages but lack macro-convergence pattern recognition. The information is public, but the interpretive sophistication required creates genuine asymmetry.
The psychological timing also matters - announcing before July 4 maximizes political impact while minimizing opposition organization time. This level of strategic timing analysis exceeds normal market efficiency assumptions.
This convergence represents genuine analytical edge, not market inefficiency exploitation.


RECOMMENDATION

OVERWEIGHT rating with 3-5% portfolio allocation for aggressive growth mandates. The combination of regulatory positioning, political tailwinds, and corporate necessity creates exceptional asymmetric opportunity with institutional-quality risk management potential.

Price Target: $120 (12-month horizon)
Catalyst Timeline: 1-45 days for initial validation

***TECHNICAL ANALYSIS VALIDATION/CONVERGENCE***

Ascending Triangle Formation

The target security exhibits a textbook ascending triangle pattern with compelling technical characteristics that independently validate our fundamental catalyst timeline.

Pattern Structure:

	‚Ä¢	Horizontal resistance: Consistent rejection at $45.31 level over multiple tests since early June
	‚Ä¢	Rising support trendline: Higher lows pattern from $29.45 base indicating systematic accumulation behavior
	‚Ä¢	Volume compression: Decreasing volatility range suggesting institutional positioning ahead of known catalyst
	‚Ä¢	Apex convergence: Pattern completion anticipated within 3-6 trading days

Institutional Significance:

The ascending triangle represents more than technical pattern recognition - it demonstrates institutional anticipation of our identified catalyst events. The rising support trendline indicates smart money accumulation at progressively higher prices, suggesting advance knowledge of pending announcements. Volume analysis reveals institutional-size block trading concentrated at key support levels, consistent with strategic positioning rather than retail speculation.

Catalyst Alignment Validation:

The technical pattern convergence timing provides independent confirmation of our fundamental analysis. The 3-6 day apex timing aligns precisely with:

	‚Ä¢	Trump‚Äôs July 4th symbolic opportunity window
	‚Ä¢	Apple‚Äôs 44-day insider blackout approaching natural conclusion
	‚Ä¢	Political necessity for immediate manufacturing narrative wins

This convergence represents what technical analysts call ‚Äúsmart money confirmation‚Äù - when institutional behavior validates fundamental thesis timing through observable market mechanics.
Breakout Probability Assessment:
Ascending triangles historically resolve upward in 70-80% of cases, with breakout magnitude typically correlating to pattern duration and volume compression intensity. The current formation demonstrates:

	‚Ä¢	4-week consolidation period: Extended enough to absorb selling pressure
	‚Ä¢	Multiple resistance tests: Each rejection followed by higher low formation
	‚Ä¢	Volume contraction: Institutional accumulation without retail distribution

Price Target Methodology:

Technical analysis provides multiple target frameworks:

	‚Ä¢	Initial breakout objective: $60+ (33% above $45.31 resistance, representing gap-fill to prior highs)
	‚Ä¢	Measured move calculation: $75-85 (pattern height of ~$16 projected from breakout point)
	‚Ä¢	Fundamental convergence target: $120 (enterprise value analysis of strategic partnership implications)

The technical setup suggests the initial breakout could reach $60-65 within days of catalyst announcement, with fundamental revaluation driving appreciation toward the $120 enterprise value target over subsequent quarters.

Information Asymmetry Evidence:

Perhaps most significantly, the ascending triangle formation demonstrates market anticipation of our identified catalysts. The pattern suggests institutional players possess advance knowledge of pending announcements, creating the exact information asymmetry that generates exceptional investment returns. The technical behavior validates our insider blackout analysis and political timing thesis through independent market confirmation.
This technical validation transforms our fundamental analysis from theoretical possibility into market-confirmed probability, with institutional positioning behavior providing real-time verification of our catalyst timeline accuracy.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã

who tf is ‚Äòwe‚Äô?.

Not intending to be mean here but you‚Äôre basing a lot on this Apple prediction. I hope it happens, and it‚Äôll pump if it does, but Nuscale is already pumped to the tits. Your AI generated ‚Äòthesis‚Äô basically says: if the Apple deal doesn‚Äôt happen, some other good thing will probably happen.

Like, what? 

I have a position (shares) similar size to yours but I won‚Äôt buy any more over $20 This company hasn‚Äôt built a single plant if I‚Äôm correct From what I understand their first ""approved"" reactor was just the design back in 2017. It was hyped up a lot as ""the only smr reactor in the USA to reach this level of approval"" but if you dug deeper, they actually weren't allowed to build as-is and needed to rework for further approval to actually build. It was found to have safety issues that were not addressed and when Romania and Idaho contracted to build with them, they found significant resistance, rising costs and they weren't as ready as they hyped up. Both those contracts were cancelled when faced with the reality of where NuScale actually was at. 

This new reactor design seems to have only passed approval...because they made the approval process easier. 

Does anyone know if they actually fixed the issues with their smaller reactor with this design or are they just rinse and repeating the process? Did they find a way to actually make it cheaper or is whomever contracts going to find the same issues with rising costs and undisclosed technical issues to be a barrier for actually building? Why didn't they continue/approve their initial reactor which had a much longer history of R&D behind it? 

IMO; the company has a history of hyping themselves up, running out of money, laying off their entire workforce save for a skeleton crew of execs looking for further funding, securing enough funding for a couple years and hiring people back. I don't think their engineering team is very cohesive ""under the hood"" and I don't think their execs are running a good business. 

It might skyrocket with an actual deal...but their history doesn't paint a very solid picture. Priced in

If nothing materializes I expect SMR to go down to 25 over the next few months The royal we, man... GPT slop Respect to OKLO bulls. It definitely takes guts to invest in these reactor designers. **HOWEVER**, these are fundamentally different plays:

OKLO: Microreactors targeting DoD/military applications (forward bases, naval propulsion, remote operations). Still pre-NRC application submission, 3-5+ year timeline. Unfortunately, they keep getting their applications flat out rejected. See 7 months ago (Atomic Alchemy-OKLO subsidiary since Feb 2025):

https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML2431/ML24311A058.pdf

NuScale: 77MW SMRs are designed for hyperscaler partnerships and commercial baseload power. Only NRC-certified SMR, modules in production, ready for 2026+ deployment.

My intuition: Retail seems to be chasing (and Wall Street appears to be nudging) OKLO‚Äôs ‚Äúnext-gen‚Äù narrative while missing NuScale‚Äôs immediate commercial opportunity. They have different customer bases entirely - Apple (or other AI hyperscalers) need(s) scalable baseload power for data centers, not microreactors for military bases.
If you believe in July-August hyperscaler catalyst timing, only NuScale can deliver validated power purchase agreements on that scale. OKLO could *potentially* be the better 5-10 year speculative play, but NuScale sits atop the hyperscaler market right now. $OKLO

1lmux19,2025-06-28,"Simple easy TQQQ strategy using the 200 SMA from QQQ with a few modifications
In my testing TQQQ is an absolute monster of an ETF that performs extremely well even from a buy and hold standpoint over long periods of time, its largest drawback is the massive drawdown exposure that it faces which can be easily sidestepped with this strategy.

This strategy is meant to basically abuse TQQQ's insane outperformance while augmenting the typical 200SMA strategy in a way that uses all of its strengths while avoiding getting whipsawed in sideways markets.

**The strategy BUYS when price crosses 5% over the 200SMA and then SELLS when price drops 3% below the 200SMA. Between trades I'll be parking my entire account in SGOV.**

So maximizing profit while minimizing risk.

You use the strategy based off of QQQ and then make the trades on TQQQ when it tells you to BUY/SELL.

Here are some reasons why I will be using this strategy:

* Simple emotionless BUY and SELL signals where I don't care who the president is, what is happening in the world, who is bombing who, who the leadership team is, no attachment to individual companies and diversified across the NASDAQ.
* \~85% win percentage and when it does lose the loses are nothing compared to the wins and after a loss you're basically set up for a massive win in the next trade.
* Max drawdown of around 40% when using TQQQ
* You benefit massively when the market is doing well and when there is a recession you basically sit in SGOV for a year and then are set up for a monster recovery with a clear easy BUY signal. So as long as you're patient you win regardless of what happens.
* The trades are often very long term resulting in you taking advantage of Long Term Capital Gains tax advantage which could mean saving up to 15-20% in taxes.
* With only a few trades you can spend time doing other stuff and don't have to track or pay attention to anything that is happening.
* Simple, easy, and massively profitable.

Below are some stats from the strategy running from 2001 with a script you can copy and paste into TradingView to make the same chart I'll be using.

For some reason people here aren‚Äôt very fond of leverage nor LETFs even though LETFs are much safer than margin. Pretty sweet, thanks! retail investors arnt fond of it, most institutional investors of course use leverage.

  
the issue is that leverage daily resetting etfs are the most expensive and worst way to implement leverage.  you should use futures (here NQ stock index futures) Yeahhhh I know it's a bit on the wild side but I figured some people might find it interesting at least to get some exposure to some other setups outside of the basic just dump everything into SPY and DCA. I used this sub a lot when I was first getting started and its helped a lot, lots of great info overall here. üòÅ One question- why is the buy and hold return from the performance tab higher?

First of all, I don't want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it visualized via closing prices from June. 20 to June 27. 

After 2-week losing streak, the stock market closed on the positive side. Despite the negative closes the past 2-week, the results were minimal and just 0.38 and 0.15. As you see the below, it was not deep correction. We've seen much bigger losses before like 9% in this year üòÄ

Here are the S&P 500's week-by-week results,

May. 30 close at 5,911.69 - June 6 close at 6,000.36 üü¢ (+1.49%)

June 6 close at 6,000.36 - June 13 close at 5,976.97 üî¥ (-0.38%)

June 20 close at 5,967.84 - June 27 close at 6,173.07 üü¢ (3.44%)

üî∏ Monday: The week started with monitoring to Middle East tensions. Before the session, White House said Trump 'Still interested' in Iran diplomacy. The stock market opened flat. Tesla launched a small fleet of self-driving taxis in Austin, Texas. The stock helped to lift the stock market because it gained more than 8%. However, Iran attacked U.S. bases in Doha, Qatar. In result, the S&P 500 gained over 1% and closed above 6,000 once again. üü¢

üî∏ Tuesday: Israel-Iran ceasefire agreement came and the stock market opened higher. Powell spoke at the congressional testimony and he still pointed to tariffs effect and inflation. The stock market closed with second session of solid gains. üü¢

üî∏ Wednesday: Compared to previous 2-day, Wednesday was a quiet. The stock market opened slightly higher. During the session, Trump said 2 important things. First one is he going to talk to Iran next week. Second one is begun interviewing candidates to replace Fed Chair with 3 to 4 names. As a result, the stock market closed flat, but still in positive. üü¢

üî∏ Thursday: Q1 GDP data was released before the session. The U.S. economy shrank 0.5%. On the other hand, jobless claims is the lowest level for 6-week. As a result, the stock market opened slightly higher. During the session, gains accelerated and closed nearly all-time high. By the way, U.S. Dollar dropped the lowest level since March 2022. üü¢

üî∏ Friday: PCE inflation was released. Core PCE inflation came higher than expectations. It came mounthly at 0.2% and increased yearly from 2.6% to 2.7%. This is Fed's favorite economic indicator.
