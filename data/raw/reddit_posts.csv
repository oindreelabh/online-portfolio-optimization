1l5mw0h,2025-06-07,My Thesis on TSLA ($295.14) and CRWV ($140.16),"***This is a multi-signal analysis***, built by synthesizing options flow data, sentiment, company fundamentals, and technical structure. I'm focusing on setups where multiple signals converge. Not just one off price moves or just pure TA.

We all know about the Elon Musk vs. Trump drama that's playing out in public. On June 5, $TSLA dropped nearly 14% in a single session. That was its largest one day drop since March 2020.

This wasn’t a move based on earnings or fundamentals. It was event driven and sentiment driven. And it came with record put volume. There were over 4 million contracts traded. This is pointing to either panic hedging or high conviction short bets. That kind of volume typically leads to short term dislocation.

On June 6, TSLA rebounded +3.7%, showing early signs of stabilization. That bounce came on strong volume, which adds weight to the reversion thesis.

**Entry Zone:**  
$285–$288 is a key support zone. A clean hold or reclaim above $300 with volume reactivates the bounce thesis.

**Target Zone:**  
$305–$318, especially if the political overhang fades and sentiment resets.

**Danger Zone:**  
Avoid entries if price retests below $280 without reversal. This could lead to further downside.

Now looking at CoreWeave ($CRWV):

CRWV IPO’d in March and ran from \~$57 (May 13) to \~$163 by June 4. This was a 185% move in just three weeks. That’s a classic parabolic extension.

It pulled back on June 5 to \~$135 and closed June 6 at $140.16. So far, this looks more like the first real cooling off period than a full reversal.

Options flow is mixed. There's still aggressive call activity at $150–$160, but we’re also seeing increasing open interest in the $130 and $120 puts. That split usually signals uncertainty. Some still chasing upside, others starting to hedge or fade.

**Entry Zone:**  
Watching $130–$134. That was prior resistance and could act as support if price compresses there. If it reclaims $145 with strength, the setup for a retest of the highs becomes viable.

**Target Zone:**  
$155–$160, but only if price gets back above $145 on volume.

**Danger Zone:**  
A breakdown below $125 likely triggers a deeper unwind. Watching $114–$118 as the next volume shelf.

**Conclusion:**  
TSLA looks like a higher confidence reversion setup. The size of the flush, the record flow, and the bounce all point to a dislocation that can snap back. CRWV is more speculative. It's a momentum name cooling off after a vertical run. It's tradable, but only with confirmation.

Would love to hear how others are approaching these. Especially if you’re tracking the same flows or setups.

1l5muv2,2025-06-07,"Federal Reserve lifts $1.95 Trillion asset cap on Wells Fargo, after seven years","After 7 years, Wells Fargo is finally able to grow their deposits and make more loans. The Federal Reserve lifted an asset cap that punished Wells Fargo after the bank committed widespread fraud against its own customers ranging from 2002 to 2016. Would you trust Wells Fargo with your hard earned money? Would you even invest in $WFC stock, now that growth is uncapped?

Below are snipets of a Reuter's Article. The link below will take you to view the full story.

""The Fed imposed the unprecedented restriction in 2018 following years of high-profile missteps at the bank, including a far-ranging scandal in which employees opened millions of unauthorized accounts for customers.

But the Fed said in a statement that the bank had made ""substantial progress"" in addressing its deficiencies, including improving its governance and risk-management programs, and completing a third-party review of its overhaul.
The Fed board voted unanimously to lift the restriction, which was the first time the central bank had directly ordered a bank to stop growing in order to address widespread shortcomings.

The decision is a major step in the bank's longstanding efforts to repair the damage from scandals that erupted in 2016, drawing public criticism and billions of dollars in fines.""

1l57sog,2025-06-07,My inability to follow my intuition has cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars,"I messed up so badly last year that I’ve completely stopped trusting my gut—and it’s destroying me financially and mentally.

I’ve built a strong intuition over the years. In 2021, I trusted it and went all in on NVDA with $40k—and it turned into hundreds of thousands. But then I got cocky. I thought this was my new normal. I listened to my brother-in-law (never again), invested in a stock without doing research, and lost $100k. Since then, my confidence has been shattered. I haven’t been able to pull the trigger on any of my instincts.

Edit: I dedicate myself to rigorous research, spending a minimum of four hours each day on relevant reading. While some may claim I’ve made poor investment choices, that’s simply not the case. I’ve studied The Intelligent Investor along with several other books recommended by Warren Buffett, treating them like a college curriculum—complete with notecards and in-depth analysis. My investment strategy blends both value and growth principles.


* I told my brother to buy Palantir at $20. He’s up 500%.
* I told friends to buy Vista & Constellation Energy, and NuScale. All up huge.
* I told my uncle to buy MicroStrategy at $150. Up 147%.
* I told my brother-in-law to buy into CoreWeave—he’s up 139%.
* Today, I told my sister to invest in the Circle IPO via Robinhood—up 167%.

Meanwhile, I’ve just been sitting on the sidelines, scared of losing more, stuck in analysis paralysis. That $100k loss ruined my self-image. I feel like an imposter. My whole family is raking it in from advice I gave, and I’ve got nothing to show for it. I probably need therapy to break this mental block.

Has anyone else been through this? Lost big and then lost your confidence? How did you get it back?

1l53a99,2025-06-06,President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to ensure continued American leadership and export of unmanned aircraft systems,"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/06/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-unleashes-american-drone-dominance/

UNLEASHING AMERICAN DRONE DOMINANCE: Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order to ensure continued American leadership in the development, commercialization, and export of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS)—otherwise known as drones.

The Order directs the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to expand drone operations by enabling routine “Beyond Visual Line of Sight” drone operations for commercial and public safety missions, and to accelerate the development, testing, and scaling of American drone technologies, including advanced air mobility and autonomous operations.

The Order establishes an electric “Vertical Takeoff and Landing” integration pilot program to accelerate the deployment of safe and lawful vertical operations in the United States, selecting at least five pilot projects to advance applications like cargo transport and medical response. It directs the FAA Administrator to deploy artificial intelligence (AI) tools to streamline and expedite UAS waiver reviews.

The Order directs the FAA Administrator to publish an updated roadmap for the integration of civil UAS into the National Airspace System. It strengthens the domestic drone industrial base by prioritizing U.S.-manufactured UAS, promoting their export and taking action to ensure our technology remains secure from undue foreign influence and exploitation.

It enhances global competitiveness by streamlining regulations, expanding market access, and utilizing federal financing tools. The Order supports the warfighter by expanding access to U.S.-manufactured high-performing drones while streamlining airspace and spectrum access.

DRIVING INNOVATION AND ECONOMIC GROWTH: President Trump is harnessing the potential of drones to boost American productivity and global leadership.
Drones enhance U.S. productivity, create high-skilled jobs, and are reshaping the future of aviation in areas such as logistics, infrastructure inspection, precision agriculture, emergency response, and public safety.
Emerging technologies, such as vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, promise to modernize methods for cargo delivery, passenger transport, and other advanced air mobility capabilities.

For too long, unfair foreign competition has posed a national security risk, disincentivizing our drone industrial base. This order is removing regulatory barriers and directing federal agencies to prioritize U.S.-manufactured drones, secure our supply chains, and promote American leadership in production, certification, and export.

ADVANCING DRONE TECHNOLOGIES: President Trump is advancing drone technologies for economic, security, and public safety benefits.
In his first term, President Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum to speed up commercial drone integration, launching a UAS Integration Pilot Program to test innovative applications with State, local, and tribal partners.  

President Trump has deployed UAS to patrol the southern border, strengthening national security through advanced surveillance and monitoring capabilities.
President Trump has advanced cutting-edge drone technologies through smart, targeted regulation, unlocking economic growth while strengthening safety, security, and innovation.

1l53a6y,2025-06-06,"Peter Navarro said ""Everyone in our first term who said our tariffs were going to be recessionary were wrong""","Most people I see on here are concerned about a recession due to tariffs. Elon tweeted it yesterday too. I forget the exact index which said this, but consumers are more afraid of a recession coming than they were around covid. 

American economist and counselor to the president for trade and manufacturing, Peter Navarro said:

""Everyone in our first term who said our tariffs were going to be recessionary and inflationary were obviously wrong. All we got was price stability and growth. 
If you understand how gdp is calculated you'll know there's 1) consumption 2) investment 3) government spending and 4) net exports. 
And when you have them selling us more than we sell to them, in the math of gdp, growth goes down. So every quarter when those numbers get reported, when you see what the net number is, that number would probably be a point or more higher if we didn't run a trade deficit.

Companies like AAPL NVDA and INTC could see movement due to trade implications. A favorable deal might give these companies the green light for continued business operations in China, potentially boosting their stock prices

Chinese consumer demand could get a significant boost especially for companies with exposure in the region like NKE or SBUX However if the deal falls short of expectations those stocks could take a hit 

 Even though we’re all hoping for a positive agreement the market could react negatively if the deal is underwhelming or doesn’t address key issues like intellectual property or market access. In addition, this trade deal could bring forward inflation concerns if the economic impact is stronger than expected

I'm personally looking at **tech** stocks next week If the deal brings positive sentiment I'm expecting a short-term rally in these sectors However I'm also hedging my bets with some **puts** on broader indices in case the deal disappoints and causes volatility

1l5mrq0,2025-06-07,Feasibility of Box Spread Arbitrage with Portfolio Margin + Automation in Canada,"I’ve been a reader of this sub for a while but never posted, Today I wanted to share an advanced strategy I’ve been researching, and I’m curious to hear your thoughts.

I think I’ve found a way to use box spreads with Portfolio Margin (PM) to generate low-risk returns, and I’m wondering if anyone in Canada, ON, has tried something like this.

Here’s the basic idea:

•	Open a PM-enabled account with Interactive Brokers

•	Trade 1-month box spreads on a highly liquid index like SPX

•	Use PM to significantly leverage the position

•	Earn the implied yield from the box (~5.5% annualized current estimate)

•	Borrow on margin at (~5.3% USD current estimate)

•	Because the borrowed funds are used to generate investment income, the interest should be tax-deductible in Canada, which reduces the effective borrowing cost (Current annually income ~$100,000)

•	Automate the whole process using IBKR’s API (rollovers, execution, risk monitoring), placing all 4 legs as a combo order to avoid legging risk. 

At first glance, the return seems small or even slightly negative. But once you factor in the low capital requirements under PM and the tax deduction on interest, the return on equity becomes positive and possibly scalable.

Has anyone here tried this or something similar in Canada? I’d love to know if there are any hidden risks, tax issues, execution slippage, margin rule quirks or if this strategy actually holds up in the real world and not just on paper.",0,0.29,12,0,Legitimate-Loan386,wallstreetbets,['C'],feasibility box spread arbitrage portfolio margin automation canada ive reader sub never posted today wanted share advanced strategy ive researching im curious hear thoughts think ive found way use box spreads portfolio margin pm generate lowrisk returns im wondering anyone canada tried something like heres basic idea open pmenabled account interactive brokers trade 1month box spreads highly liquid index like spx use pm significantly leverage position earn implied yield box 55 annualized current estimate borrow margin 53 usd current estimate borrowed funds used generate investment income interest taxdeductible canada reduces effective borrowing cost current annually income 100000 automate whole process using ibkrs api rollovers execution risk monitoring placing 4 legs combo order avoid legging risk first glance return seems small even slightly negative factor low capital requirements pm tax deduction interest return equity becomes positive possibly scalable anyone tried something similar canada id love know hidden risks tax issues execution slippage margin rule quirks strategy actually holds real world paper

1l5m79c,2025-06-07,What are the pros and cons of using cash from investment accounts to max out SEP contributions?,"Background: I am in my mid 60s and get all my income from a small business ownership arrangement. I have been maxing out SEP contributions for the past few years.  There are no employees.

I’m not so certain I want to max out this year because I am taking initial, baby steps to ease into retirement. Such as a do a few minor fix up/spruce up projects to my home to prep for a possible future sale, to buy a new vehicle (that I hope will last 10 or 15 years), and possibly buy a new home in a LCOL area.  I haven’t initiated any of these, yet.

I do not plan to take withdraws from my SEP account or other IRA rollover accounts for several more years.  The possibility of buying a new home in a LCOL area is the main thing making me hesitate to max out contributions.

Other than the obvious benefit of postponing federal taxes until later, and expectedly in a lower tax environment, what are the pros and cons of using cash from a non-retirement account in place of cash from current income to make SEP contributions?

There are no IRS rules that say the actual dollars one puts in an SEP account have to be the same dollars that come from income. The main rule is you have to have business income to justify the contribution amount. 

All my accounts are under one roof, Fidelity.  So, from my point of view I’d simply be moving dollars from one account, a non tax advantaged account, to an SEP account.  One account decreases and another account increases.",1,0.67,4,0,ElderlyYoungster,investing,['C'],pros cons using cash investment accounts max sep contributions background mid 60s get income small business ownership arrangement maxing sep contributions past years employees im certain want max year taking initial baby steps ease retirement minor fix upspruce projects home prep possible future sale buy new vehicle hope last 10 15 years possibly buy new home lcol area havent initiated yet plan take withdraws sep account ira rollover accounts several years possibility buying new home lcol area main thing making hesitate max contributions obvious benefit postponing federal taxes later expectedly lower tax environment pros cons using cash nonretirement account place cash current income make sep contributions irs rules say actual dollars one puts sep account dollars come income main rule business income justify contribution amount accounts one roof fidelity point view id simply moving dollars one account non tax advantaged account sep account one account decreases another account increases

Are you bullish or bearish on quantum stocks right now, and why?

Here are some potential reasons for the rise, and I'd love your insights:

 * Tech Breakthroughs: Are we seeing real advancements making commercial applications imminent? Is ""quantum advantage"" finally tangible?

 * Enterprise Interest: Are more companies exploring quantum, with early adoptions sparking investor confidence?

 * Big Money & Geopolitics: Massive private capital influx and government investments worldwide. Is this accelerating development and perception?

 * AI Crossover: Is some of the AI hype bleeding into quantum, seen as the next frontier?

 * Positive Earnings: Some pure-plays like QBTS and QUBT reported surprising revenue/profitability. Are these early signs of viability being over-amplified?

 * Short Squeezes: Could short sellers be covering positions?

Long-Term Holds?
Given the volatility, what are your thoughts on quantum stocks as long-term holds (5+ years)?

 * Any specific companies you think are well-positioned (e.g., IONQ, D-Wave, Rigetti, or larger tech like IBM, Google, Microsoft)?

 * What are the major risks for long-term investors in this space?

1l5dzat,2025-06-07,$IZEA: The Cash-Heavy Influencer Stock That Could Pull a MicroStrategy-Style Crypto Pivot,"The quick thesis

* Cash > Market Cap.  IZEA held $52.2 M in cash and investments at 3-31-25 with zero long-term debt  .  At today’s $2.90 share price and ≈16.9 M shares out, the whole company is worth only ≈$49 M  .  You’re buying the operating business for negative dollars.
* Already crypto-friendly.  In 2022 management started accepting and holding BTC & ETH for influencer campaigns  and tracks 60+ coins in its BrandGraph tool.  They know the plumbing—no big learning curve if they upsize holdings.
* Huge re-rating precedent. 
   * MicroStrategy adopted a Bitcoin treasury in 2020 and its stock is up ≈3,200 % since, powered largely by the BTC stash  .
   * SharpLink Gaming announced a $425 M raise to buy ETH on 27-May-25 and the stock spiked 400 % in one day  .
* Same ingredients in place: big idle cash, crypto-savvy leadership, tiny float.  A 5-10 % allocation (≈$5-7 M) to BTC/ETH could flip IZEA into a liquid micro-cap “crypto proxy,” drawing in the same momentum crowd that chased MSTR and SBET.

  
Why management might actually do it

1. Visibility & clients.  Crypto treasury status would grab headlines and resonate with Web3-leaning influencers—IZEA’s core customer set.
2. Shareholder pressure is cheap.  Under SEC Rule 14a-8, one small holder can file a proposal asking the board to study a BTC/ETH reserve.  Amazon and Microsoft already had similar proposals make their ballots—the SEC allowed them.
3. New CEO.  Patrick Venetucci (took over Sep 2024) has a mandate to “re-energize growth”; a crypto-reserve headline is an instant catalyst.

  
Risks and why they look manageable

* Crypto volatility: starting with a single-digit percent allocation caps downside to a few million on a pullback, while upside could double the market cap.
* GAAP impairments: non-cash accounting noise; markets looked past it for MSTR.
* Low liquidity: true, but thin floats exaggerate moves when a narrative catches fire (see SharpLink’s 4× day).

  
Bottom line

With the stock priced below its cash and a management team that already handles BTC/ETH, IZEA sits one press release away from a MicroStrategy-style narrative shift.  If they announce even a modest Bitcoin/Ethereum treasury strategy, the valuation math could change overnight—exactly what happened to SBET last month and to MSTR over the past four years.

I’m long a starter position and watching for any hint of a treasury move—or a shareholder proposal—to light the fuse.  DYOR, but this looks like the cleanest cash-rich micro-cap bet on the next corporate-crypto catalyst.

1l59anr,2025-06-07,Revisiting $CRCW — Low-Key Crypto OTC with Recent Leadership Moves,"I wanted to bring back a ticker that had some attention here last year — The Crypto Company ($CRCW). At the time, it briefly spiked following a discussion comparing it to $CRYBF (which had a huge run). That move was largely driven by speculation and interest, with no news or filings from the company itself.

Since then, $CRCW has pulled back significantly. It’s currently sitting around a ~$964K market cap with what appears to be a maxed-out share structure. Liquidity is thin, and message board chatter is minimal — which could be a sign of under-the-radar status or just general disinterest.

What caught my attention again was the company’s updated language on LinkedIn, suggesting a potential shift in focus. It now outlines broader ambitions across several areas:
	•	Blockchain mining & custody
	•	Crypto ETFs and tokenization platforms
	•	AI-native Web3 tools
	•	Digital compliance and security solutions

The phrasing leans more toward infrastructure-building and away from its earlier emphasis on consulting/education. While this could be just branding, it might also hint at a new strategic direction.

Also worth noting: the CEO recently appointed new officials, which might align with that shift. There hasn’t been a press release yet, so this is all speculative at the moment.

Not making any bold claims here — just sharing some observations for discussion. If anyone else has been following CRCW or has thoughts on the new direction, I’d love to hear your take!

1l582y2,2025-06-07,"PHIO is showing strong signs of life, worth a closer look","Curious why no one is talking about Phio Pharmaceuticals (PHIO).   
  
It looks like they’ve got a lot of positive momentum building.

Their lead asset, PH-762, is currently in a Phase 1b trial targeting skin cancers like cSCC, melanoma, and Merkel cell carcinoma. Early results are encouraging with several patients experienced complete tumor clearance, while others showed meaningful tumor reduction. What’s particularly noteworthy is that the treatment has been well tolerated, with no dose limiting side effects reported so far.

From a financial perspective, PHIO appears to be in a relatively stable position. As of the latest report, they’re holding around $13 million in cash, which should give them enough runway to continue development without scrambling for immediate funding. They’ve also been reducing costs across R&D and admin, showing they’re being smart about burn rate while progressing their clinical work.

Earlier this year, saw a significant run up (*over 100%*) following these clinical updates. While it’s cooled off a bit since then, it’s been picking up buy ratings and new price targets (*H.C. Wainwright updated to $14*). With more clinical updates expected and a clear focus on immuno oncology, this might be a sleeper pick that’s setting up for a bigger move down the line.

They’ve also made a few strategic hires recently, which could signal they’re preparing for growth or positioning themselves for partnership opportunities.

As always, this is a speculative play it’s still early stage biotech but PHIO seems to be building a solid case for itself. Definitely one to keep an eye on.

We have agreed to extend the binding exclusivity period set forth in the Letter of Intent until June 7, 2025, to allow more time to complete and execute the anticipated merger agreement.
Development of the Optejet UFD 
Progress in the development of the Optejet user-filled device (UFD) continues and remains on track to file for U.S. regulatory approval in September of this year. An approval would provide for potential multiple commercial opportunities either directly with consumers or through eye care practitioner offices as well as potential and existing license partners, including Arctic Vision in China and Korea.
First Quarter 2025 Financials
A broad restructuring of the company was implemented, reducing overall cash burn by approximately 70% versus one year ago and entering into a debt restructuring agreement earlier this year which defers certain repayment obligations until October 2025.
Michael Rowe, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We remain focused on seeking to maximize shareholder value by working to complete a definitive merger agreement with Betaliq that, if and when completed, will create a new eyecare company with immediate revenue through the sale of our existing FDA-approved products and significant pipeline opportunities that we believe leverage complementary FDA-approved technologies, including our Optejet® platform.”

1l55ws7,2025-06-06,DUTV could be an early opportunity,"DUTV (Digital Utilities Ventures, soon to rebrand as Easy Environmental Solutions) has gone 4x this year so far and still only $0.040. Easy to snag 1,000's of shares for cheap. They dropped some solid Q1 numbers -- more sales (and more hires). I think they are moving in the right direction. They’ve been buying up other companies that align with their mission like Easy Energy Systems.

The company is focused on creating and selling tech that helps clean water and improve farming in a sustainable way. They make modular systems that clean polluted water without chemicals and that turns organic waste into safe fertilizer. They own manufacturing facilities to build their products in the U.S. and are expanding their reach into markets like marinas (they acquired Lifestyle Dock Company). They want to tackle big environmental problems with new tech.

I spent $99 on 6,000 shares a few weeks ago, then it tripled in value. Still an amazingly low price so I feel like this could be a stock that blows up down the road and there's a chance to get in very early. Or not, who knows... Thoughts?

1l53g4p,2025-06-06,$SPCE Virgin Galactic after executive order to promote supersonic aviation,"The Executive Order aims to bolster the United States' position in supersonic aviation. By prioritizing high-speed aviation, the administration seeks to enhance America's aerospace innovation capabilities. The initiative underscores a strategic effort to regain global leadership in this sector. The Executive Order likely includes measures to streamline regulations, incentivize research and development, and foster public-private partnerships to advance supersonic flight technologies. This move aligns with broader efforts to maintain America's technological edge and competitiveness in the aerospace industry. The White House's fact sheet likely provides further details on specific policy objectives, potential economic impacts, and the administration's vision for the future of supersonic aviation in the United States.

Virgin Galactic is actively developing a Mach 3 supersonic aircraft. Don’t mistake this for Virgin Atlantic btw. 

While SPCE is best known for space tourism, it has also been quietly working on a Mach 3 commercial aircraft with Rolls-Royce, targeting premium long-haul routes.

Designed to cruise at Mach 3 (~2,300 mph), Operates above 60,000 feet, Compatible with existing airport infrastructure, London to New York in 90 minutes. Support for commercial + defense crossover applications. 


TL;DR:

The executive order could open floodgates for U.S. supersonic development. $SPCE is the only public equity with a credible Mach 3 program. At <$4 the market seems to have forgotten this optionality.
