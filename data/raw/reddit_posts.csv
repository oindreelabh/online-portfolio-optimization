1lhk6ih,2025-06-22,"Next best OKLO buy in?
So US hit Iranian nuclear sites so would this have short term stress on OKLO or will OKLO manage to hold it out and keep climbing? And would OBBBA be impactful enough on OKLO to reduce its stock or is it more resilient? I'd assume if OBBBA gets rid of environmental tax credits, it could hurt OKLO in their next earnings but I don't know how that could work since OKLO isn't making money. I'm just trying to find a good price to buy in shares and hoping the stock plummets again after this short term hype to make the most of my money. 
Its a highly speculative stock. I like it but trying to work out what its share price is going to do will be simply guessing. Hasn't even got close to building its first aurora reactor yet. 

If you buy it, just know you're holding it for 5, maybe 10 years min and it's going to be bumpy. Stock was overbought, has come down recently to the upper 50's, does it hold the 20 day moving average ($54 and change)?

If the market is down substantially Monday could certainly see the more speculative stuff (like Oklo, which won't be generating revenue until around 2027) down with it but feels like there's still momentum buyers that would probably step in for all this kind of stuff. OKLO was smart to do an offering a week or two ago with the stock near highs.  

Probably won't be the last one if the buying continues this year - any company that is early or relatively early stage should be considering equity raises in this market. If there's such demand for the stock, raise $ as further cushion in a world where things can change quickly.

OKLO also isn't without comeptition. Hovr If they continue to make offering would the stock continue to go down. And the thing I don't understand is how would this impact earnings report. If they're still in the negatives by Q2 would stock go down or stay up as long as they beat the expected eps even if it's negative? > If they continue to make offering would the stock continue to go down.

If they sell more stock, the shares will go down but if people actually do believe in the company long-term and you have a situation where they won't even have anything built/running until 2027, it's not a bad thing to have as much money as possible to be able to comfortably navigate all the issues that may come up between here and there. 

""If they're still in the negatives by Q2 would stock go down or stay up as long as they beat the expected eps even if it's negative?""

They're losing money and won't be building anything that generates money until 2027. I think what most people are going to look for in an earnings report from a company like this are new details. Did they sign new deals? Stock up. Is there going to be a delay? Stock down. If a stock is up 165% YTD (which this is) and they're not going to have revenue until 2027 and they announce some sort of negative news,  that is what could send this materially lower. 

In other words, the market expects ""we lost more money"" and will probably overlook that if it's to a reasonable degree.

1lhg29q,2025-06-22,"Is TLT now a good play with the Iran conflict?
Is TLT the great thing to do, bonds? 

  
TLT has been a safe haven. They say treasuries aren't safe. There is so much noise that I can't identify a solid strategy for stability. Will people flock to bonds for stability with so much going on?
It's not a stable market. The money will flow into gold and precious metals. Watch... Monday gold is gonna moon Not TLT. No very dangerous play, if it leads to a bigger conflict the deficit is going to explode even more so during good economy and during turmoil the usd usually skyrockets but now its dumping Verizon is stable. Nobody giving up their connection. Cash flow machine. Yields 6.5% versus the 4 odd percent you get with Treasury bonds.

Can’t see interest rates rising given the economic damage at far, even if it’s inflationary as Powell says.

If he cranks it up, it’ll be like dominoes for the economic collapse. 

Plus you have to expect a pliable stooge to come in after Powells term is up, with the sole mandate : lower interest rates. (As he was initially with the fast and loose stimmy packages…)

Long dated treasury bonds, (to me), is the only is the only thing with a little certainty.

Besides, 5% coupon value if they hold flat is nothing to sniff at.

And this is all without whatever the Iran conflict will create (just flat out up and down stability).

My only concern is that Trump-economic of tax cuts / overspending before a ridiculous budget is signed / and a money-dump military conflict in the horizon; how strong can US treasuries remain?

Maybe inflation protected bonds is the real ‘play’???
Or just have bonds as part of a balanced portfolio like a normal person. Bonds at almost 5% do hold up to inflation, not to mention if you anticipate cuts the prices jump and you can exit profitably, one reason I think the fed has been content to buy them lately not only to save auctions but they know their future plans as well The cuts at BLS aren't defunding.

1lhewq2,2025-06-22,"Historical Prices vs Historical Performance Claims
I need some help on the stock system as a whole. I'm doing some research on stock price history. 

In the period from 1980 to 1990, several stocks were considered ""best performers"", including USB, Circuit City, Nike, and some others. Nike is listed as having a 23,000% return. Circuit City was supposed to have a 90x return. USB is listed as a 22,000% return. 

But when I review the historical prices... I don't see where those returns come from. 

Take USB:  
Jan 1980 price about $0.70   
Dec 1989 price about $2.35 (3x increase)

Stock splits  
1984 1.1 for 1  
1985 2 for 1  
1989 2 for 1 (roughly 5.5x cumulative)

All that together is roughly a 1500% return. 

There are dividends, roughly quarterly. So that might account for it. Some are into the forty cents a share and some are not even a dime per share. 

NIKE is even worse though.   
Jan 1981 price about $0.16  
Dec 1989 price about $0.87 (5.5x increase)

1x 2:1 stock split in the entire decade

6x $0.10 and 1x $0.15 dividend the entire decade. 

How does anyone get a 23000% return from that? 

What am I missing?

1lhediu,2025-06-22,"Is Ferrari a good stock?
I'm not familiar with the car much but I do know that for rich folks owning Ferrari is a matter of prestige and a way to signal wealth. 

With ICE cars in secular decline, do you think EV Ferrari would hold the same strong brand presence and social significance?. 

Or would ICE Ferrari cars get even more expensive and become like collectibles that are only  produced in limited quantities each year in a post-ice car world that are dominated by EVs? 

I'd love hear about what the community has to say. 
It’s definitely performing better than their F1 team at the moment. Incredible stock, incredible company. Worth doing DD Luxury and exotic markets aren’t typically affected by broader market as much. People with money have money. When I bought my first Ferrari I didn’t check how the economy was doing, I could afford it so I bought it. 

Company like Ferrari is truthfully recession proof. Auto manufacturers don’t typically smoke the broader market. Yet here we are. (Yes, Tesla does - different story)

Look beyond their cars, and at their branding, which is equally - or more - important than the product. 

PE ratios mean hardly anything anymore. Huh? It’s a fantastic stock historically. Zoom out. Not everything needs to make you tomorrow, it smoked the S&P the last 5 years Not if you want to make money. >a global economy that is on the down swing

Your typical 9-5 office worker or Starbucks barista buying a Ferrari in any economy? Counter argument: There will always be wealthy people regardless of the economy, they will always be able to buy exotic cars. Their backlog for orders goes back years. You do realize that the people buying Ferraris can lose half their wealth and still have enough to buy a 100 Ferraris?

1lh3cl1,2025-06-21,"Allocating 20% of portfolio to QQQ LEAPS
My thesis is simple:

1. If you want to maximize your likelihood of optimal growth, you need to make high conviction bets - like 5-10 at most.
2. Allocate 80% of your portfolio to these high conviction plays.
3. Put the remainder 20% as a ""growth cushion"" like QQQ. Over a long-enough horizon, QQQ will beat SPY (basically saying tech drives growth).

QQQ is good, but why not use leverage to your advantage and do QQQ LEAPS instead?

Has anyone used a similar strategy or can you share how you would ""safely"" manage a QQQ LEAPS position on an ongoing basis?

Expiration, strike/delta, roll up/roll out mechanics would be awesome.
You might be asking in the wrong sub. Might want to check out r/options. 

In my opinion, LEAPS out 2 years, 80 delta, DITM helps balance risk/reward a bit. A recession or another liberation day might give you a big drawdown for a long time. 

I would roll mine out every 365 days to give myself a full 2 years at any time for a peace of mind. Every few years (e.g. 2022 at -32%) you will experience a negative return for the year so give it enough time to dig itself out. [deleted] At least wait 2 more weeks until we get past the Iran war decision deadline which also lines up with the unfreezing or dumbass’ tariffs. > Has anyone used a similar strategy 

Not me, but a lot of people in WSB have.

> ... or can you share how you would ""safely"" manage a QQQ LEAPS position on an ongoing basis?

Loaded question with no answer that uses logic and reason.

Questions for you:

1. How old are you?
2. On a scale 1 to 10, 1 being a WSB redditor and 10 being one of those top PhDs from a top B-School hired by Wall Street, how financially savvy/educated are you?
3. How big in $ is your portfolio?
4. How much $ are you going to add in the next 12 months?
3. What is the difference between:

 * Speculating

1lgx6xa,2025-06-21,"What are the best companies to benefit from increased power/grid demand?
AI demand is already producing strain on existing grid and power plants. Fairfax county VA recently passed restrictions on new data centers due to partially due to concerns related to energy demands and grid stability. No matter what though new AI GPUs and data centers will require more and more electricity. EVs will also require more power consumption as their market share increases. There is also going to be some demand for heat pumps replacing oil/gas furnaces particularly in the Northeast and Midwest.  

It seems like no matter what there will need to be billions spent on the grid regionally and nationally for the reasons above. Which companies will benefit the most from this? Looking at either companies that either sell large amounts of raw materials provided or that sell unique components/services that grid providers will need and pay a premium for. 
You are kind of late to the party

constellations energy is a big one, they are up 700% in the past 5 years $CEG Of course it is. So is GE Vernova. But these are the two companies benefitting the most from increased power/grid demand.

You can't come to the party three years late and expect all the drinks to still be there :) They’re the biggest nuclear energy company in USA Siemens Energy and GE Vernova. Not too much. Just equivalent to dozens of cities of half a million to a million people popping up in a year or two. I am a firefighter in a small town of less than 20k. Majority of our open land is being developed into data centers. We have Google, compass, data bank and a couple other companies building large multi building data centers right now and more planned. Our city manager said that with the data center currently on the books we will use more energy than all of Houston in our small town. 

It's wild to think that is true, but when we walk the sites and see the number of large back up generators, electrical rooms, cooling towers, it easy to see that they use a shit ton of power. We don't have any on the books yet they use small modular reactors, but some data centers are building their own nuclear tractors for the energy demands. Bro I don’t think you’re really grasping the scale of these data centers. The computing revolution you’re talking about essentially people getting personal computer. Major cultural change, but personal computers use less electricity than refrigerators. It was an incremental increase. 

Hyperscale data centers (AWS, Azure, GCP) have 100,000 of servers with each one have the memory of 60-120 personal computers. And that’s not even touching the ungodly amount of storage, the advanced cooling systems, the networks cables that sprawl the entire globe, or the redundancies needed to ensure 99.999% up time. 

To compare this change to the personal computers adoption is to compare the household loom to an industrial textile mill. 
Yea they’re doing fundamentally the same thing, but the scale is the differentiator. CEG CEG, Duke, AEP, BIPC, NEE and CWEN.A. I'm starting with these So, these data centers in a few cities will burn more electricity than the literal computing revolution across the country?

Share &amp; Analyst Opinion
• Current price: ~31.44 USD (US trading system) 
• Analyst estimates:
• Consensus: &quot;Outperform&quot; with price targets of around 52.9 USD .
• Citi: &quot;Buy&quot; with a target of 51 USD (+41%) .

Business development &amp; Q1 2025
• Revenue Q1 2025: 301.1 billion ¥ (approx. 41.5 billion USD), +15.8% compared to Previous year  
• Adjusted earnings per share: ¥8.41, +49% YoY, stronger than expected 
• Operating profit: ¥10.5 billion, margin improved to 3.5% (retail 4.9%) 
• Net profit (GAAP): ¥10.9 billion, +52.7% YoY 
• Shareholder buyback: USD 1.5 billion in Q1, program with USD 3.5 billion remaining volume
• Cash reserves: approximately ¥203 billion (~USD 28 billion) at the end of the quarter

Conclusion: JD.com significantly exceeded expectations, showing strong sales and profit growth while simultaneously expanding its margin.
I was also surprised how the earnings got taken in from the market You can’t know anything with Trump 😂 there was talks about it Bought more yesterday, significantly undervalued and in the best position to take advantage of Gov subsidies. Now expanding into food delivery and hotels; which has negatively affected stock price in spite of 30Billion cash at hand. 

Unloved by the market as the market has reacted negatively to raised dividends, reinvestment into said industries (to create all encompassing e-commerce app) and positive earnings. 

PT 50+ and imo best risk /return investment for a large cap As someone invested for over a year in JD; 100-300% is doable but more so in 1-2 years. 

Catalysts: US- China trade deal (in spite of JD having almost 0 revenue in US)

Continued subsidies and stimulus 

Expansion abroad (2026) 

Gain of market share in Hotels (Trip.com) and in food delivery (Meituan). 

Increased net margins with help of robotics in warehousing and AI potentially. 

IMO; they need a better PR team- earnings calls are too repetitive and sounds eerily similar to early Amazon shareholder letters in the early 2000s (constantly talking about consumer satisfaction and application) 

IMO buying JD now is like buying Amazon in 2009, with the difference being more cash at hand, less debt. (Approx same Mcap) You’re a clown if you really think Trump can’t and won’t do something random out of the blue Thanks for the reminder - I've got a small position in JD for a while now and will look to increase it. I think you sold me on this. At under an 8 p/e this thing would run massively with some multiple expansion. BABA is just under double the p/e. 

All jd has been doing is growing revenue and earnings. I’m with ya on a buy and hold here I bought back in march in the $42s.. so yeah a bit in the red so far. My biggest fear is if Trump decide to delist Chinese stock which was in the talks some month ago. Maybe a few more shares on monday then. Yes, I see it that way too, buy it, leave it for a few months and take a profit of +100-200%!!! Correct, they only operate in Asia.

**Intro:** 

**-** I work as a personal trainer for a high-net-worth manager in Canada.

\- I sniffed out Telesat when I saw a 650 million grant go out to a company with a $850 million market cap.

\- The TSAT Ceo and our newly elected Prime Minister are buddies, kids play sports together etc etc: [reddit.com/r/canadian/comments/1fhd72w/looks\_like\_our\_new\_trudeauappointed\_economic/](http://reddit.com/r/canadian/comments/1fhd72w/looks_like_our_new_trudeauappointed_economic/)

  
\- I wanted to use this as a talking point to talk smack about our government, which I didn't vote for, but instead I dug into the stock. I gave it to the guy I train. His team did the DD and hired Cormark to do it as well. 

\- The results: there are creditors to please, there is a backlog of customers with deals waiting in the pipeline, the premium product is coming out in 2027. The creditors won't risk hurting to company for the big payday they will get when this new 'national-darling' company makes it big.

1lhlk8y,2025-06-22,"What advice would you give to someone who doesn't know anything about investing?
I want to start investing in the future, but I have no knowledge. I have a Revolut account and I saw that they also offer some investments, but I won't get started until I have a minimum of knowledge. 

So I'm asking you. Give me your advice/tips, mistakes to avoid, what I absolutely need to know, books or videos that could be useful to me, etc. Act as if you were my teacher and I was your student. 

I'm ready to write everything down 📝
Buy sp500 on a weekly automatic basis. 

Pick a broker that lets you buy fractionals if your weekly isn’t enough for a whole share. Fidelity. Robinhood. Cashapp is fine. No idea what the one you listed is. I’ve heard of it, just never looked at it. 

Work to increase that weekly amount. Don’t rely on self discipline, set to auto. Always have an auto. 

If your auto investment is a significant part of your income, you’re doing great. 

Have an emergency fund. Only sell investments when you have something urgent to pay for. 

Educate yourself along the way. There are optimizations to be known. But that basic concept is all you really need. Best of luck. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket and if you want a large amount of money in one stock consider buying in chunks slowly to assess how the stock is performing Start. 

Open account and start. 

Buy index funds, don't think too much about it. Understand that there will be down years, but in the end there will be more up years. [Bogleheads' Guide to the Three-Fund Portfolio](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40374828-the-bogleheads-guide-to-the-three-fund-portfolio). Most people should simply invest in diverse index funds. Simple is better, unless you want to become a trader and do speculative stuff. 

Consistency is also important. Get a job and make money. Use that money to invest. Get budget sorted out. Make sure incomings are more than outgoings :). Pay off high interest debt - credit cards, etc. Save an emergency fund - 3-6 months worth of expenses (in case you lose your job, etc) - don’t touch it - put it in a HYSA. 

Then you can start investing. Start with retirement accounts - they are tax exempt until retirement. If your employer runs a 401k, invest in it. If they match your contributions - ie for every $ you put in they put in $ - even better - max it out, because it’s free money. Then open an IRA - max it out every year. Invest consistently - every month - out of your pay packet - as much as you can. Don’t stop if the market crashes - shares are on sale. If you have left over cash save or invest it in a taxable brokerage account. 

Take your age subtract it from 100-120 (depending on risk). This is the % you should have invested in equities. The balance in bonds. Rebalance it every 5 years. As you get closer to retirement your bonds as a % of your portfolio should increase. 

Invest in low cost / zero load indexed mutual funds. Vanguard, Fidelity, T Rowe Price have tons of good funds. 

Don’t pay for the services of a financial advisor unless you’ve got a complicated situation- they charge 1%+ and it eats into your gains. 

Ignore the market swings. Over time - the value of the market goes up. Ignore speculating on bitcoin / gold / other commodities. Sure - have some play money in there but don’t make it a sig part of your portfolio. 

This is not financial advice and I am not a financial advisor. 

Good luck! Take Accounting 101 and then Finance 101 at a local university or community college.

You’re putting all your eggs in one basket.

As long as you’re fine taking significant losses, that’s OK. But if this is money, you are saving for retirement and not money. You are saving for some fun toys, just leave it be. Stick with safe 21k Why trade? Just budget more money to DCA into companies you believe in?

You sound like you want to shift chips. Gamble. Well. Best of luck. Play it safe with fund. [removed] Why not just invest in a broad based index fund?  You are young and this will grow significantly over the years.

1lhjxii,2025-06-22,"Anyone else here self-taught in managing their own investments after a windfall or inheritance? How’s it going for you?
Hi all, I’m in my late 20s, working a pretty standard tech job (did a few years in retail before that). Sometime last year, I was fortunate enough to receive a mid to high 5 figure inheritance from family. At first, I let the bank’s advisors handle it, but honestly the returns were pretty underwhelming. So I decided to start learning on the side on my own. Taught myself the basics of investing, lots of youTube, books and lurking on this sub haha.

Fast forward to a year now, and I’ve managed to grow my little inheritance to just over six figures. Nothing crazy, but I’m pretty proud considering I started with zero experience and just learned as I went. I’m still keeping things pretty conservative (mostly index funds, some blue-chip stocks, and a bit of crypto for fun).

My main goal is to save up for a down payment on a property in the next few years, so I’m trying to balance growth with not taking on too much risk.

Curious if anyone else here is in a similar boat, either got a windfall, received an inheritance or just decided to take the DIY route with their investments. How’s it going for you? How long have you been managing your own portfolio, and what’s been your biggest lesson so far?

Would love to hear some stories, tips, or even just cheer each other up about the learning curve, process, etc. Thanks!
If you have no experience, just put it into a SP500 or global index fund. Requires no skills, no time, and you beat 90% of investors. ETF. done.  
Sub resources. Self-taught investor post windfall. So far, so good! no windfall here, just learning about anything there is, and doing really well, my first investment ever was a 5 year railroad bond, with a 10% interest rate and they sold it for 95% , never looked back after that. if you want to invest in equities, just make sure to get to know the companies first. Man, reading this felt like flipping through a page of my own story. I’m not gonna lie — I didn’t start with an inheritance, but back when I dropped out of uni, I had this random lump sum from selling off some leftover inventory from an old side hustle. It was like £30K. Didn’t sound like much at the time, but to me? It was everything. No one in my family ever talked stocks or investing, so I had to self-teach *everything*. YouTube deep dives, late-night Reddit threads, even those beginner investing PDFs floating around — I soaked it all in.

At first, I did exactly what you did — let the bank “manage” it, and yeah… underwhelming returns is putting it *kindly*. Once I took it into my own hands and shifted into ETFs, blue-chip stocks, and eventually a bit of ETH and BTC on the side, things actually started growing. Over the next few years, that little stash snowballed into mid-six figures. Best part? The confidence it gave me. Not even just the returns — just knowing *I did that*, brick by brick.

What actually surprised me was letting a crypto investment manager handle a small altcoin portfolio on the side — I’m talking just mid-four figures — but the way he rotated into certain alts during key runs turned that slice into a sneaky little passive income machine. Totally hands-off for me, and it’s actually been one of the most consistent earners in the background.

Biggest lesson for me? Emotions can wreck you if you’re not careful. I once sold during a dip thinking I was protecting myself… only to miss the rebound two weeks later. So now I try to zoom out, stick to the plan, and trust the long-term plays. You’re doing amazing already — especially balancing growth with the goal of a down payment. That’s smart, not boring.

Curious though — what’s been your biggest “a-ha” moment since going solo? Was there a turning point where it all just started to click for you? Investing well, thanks! This reads like AI wrote it I was in the same situation. Had my I heritance being managed by a team, but was paying over a hundred dollars a month in fees. So I moved it to a self managed account and it's in low cost index funds.


Originally it was in stupid ETFs like a growth, SP500, and value which doesn't make sense because all the ETFs together would have the same effect a 60/40 asset allocation fund.


I primarily employ a combo of low volitility ETFs and dividend ETFs to hopefully smooth out the dips.


I avoided the heavy 40% in bonds because if you look at the bond market it was doing really poorly the past couple of years.


With the announcement of possible interest rate cuts, it looked like the 60/40 portfolio is set to make a comeback.  One whole year and claiming victory already huh. Lol. How many weeks of underwhelming performance could pro management have had?

I doubt there is a single bond in your portfolio if it grew enough for you to brag about in a year. Zero fixed income and some crypto means it ain’t conservative. Lol. 

It’s fine. As long as you don’t panic sell you should be good. One year is too small a size to tell. 

Hopefully you are constantly adding. DCA is the move. Best of luck. Truly.

1lhf447,2025-06-22,"Can someone help out pyschologically with a struggle re: lost money?
I am of ethnic minority and help two elderly females for whome I'm biologically / related next of kin to ensure that they have a good retirement/quality of life/less money issues. They aren't rick but with careful help I hope for them to feel comfortable and have decent quality of life.

  
I'm beating myself over a decision where I didn't do it myself and tried to guide them to protect their assests money. The assest was in a foreign country and the value of currency depreciated greately despite me trying hard to tell them to take care of it, change it etc. They live now in a western country with the high cost of living. 

  
The total loss was 35K but I imagine that even if I did my best and did myself, I would have likely had 7k-15k by the time i got there etc so in total the loss is about 25K. 

I feel bad that they missed out the interst rate (high) or some gains in the stock market or SPY(50% Sin the last 3 years). 

It's made me bitter that there's some gender dynamics at play - women's money is not considered as worth it or elderly female's money isn't considered as requiring care unless they have a strong advocate etc.

  
How should I think about it differently ? Realize that the net loss was actually not 35k but more like 25k is more tolerable (taking it account that I would have still lost 7-15k anyways ) was good way to think.

Should I be grateful that I stepped in when I did versus years later when the assest (foreign currency to dollar) would have been even more worthless?

Is it just part of being an investor that sometimes despite knowing everything and knowing that the market is down, it's time to invest, you have a source of funds - but it ends up not happening? I guess if i look back at other periods of my life, I would have been a millionare if I invested X amount in 2009 when I had the funds and a way to do it,etc?

Can someone more experienced say something to help my psychological pain and regret and sadness? It's just part of being investort to have these experiences?
Honestly I read all this and still have no idea what you're talking about. I do feel for you though, on the part of being in the ethnic minority, and feeling like you do not have the systemic advantages that others do. On the other hand, complaining about it or feeling sorry for yourself won't do anything to change it either. Can you please just say the country, no ones gonna dox you, no one can help you like this You cant change the past Wtf? If they live in the USA, their assets should be predominately tied to the US currency. This isnt true for any other country, since the US is so dominant in the global market cap. But, generally you want to overweight the countries markets you live in to hedge future consumption in that currency and tied to that market.

1lhf3tn,2025-06-22,"Should I add Roth and/or IRA to my portfolio?
I have more or less these in my family's portfolio: 

40k in cash
120k in ETFs
400k in combined retirement accounts 457 and 401k.

Both me and the wife have government jobs that have pensions...I myself can retire in 10 years. Hopefully my house will be paid in 11 years.

My question is am I missing anything by not having a Roth or IRA? 

I am paying low interest rates on my mortgage so I basically have minimal deduction from it.  So I'm maxing out as much as I can on contributions to the 457 and 401k to take advantage of the tax deferment.

Any advice? Thanks!
You got some reading to do based on how you’re referring to “Roth or IRA” That 120k… is that just in a brokerage account? If so, then yes, you are missing out by not having an IRA. Contribute to a traditional IRA if you want the tax benefit now; contribute to a Roth IRA if you want the tax benefit later. Roth lets you withdraw invested amount tax free.. I should have clarified that outside of the 401k/457 tax deferred contributions, I don't have any others like Roth contributions, regular IRAs of Roth IRAs.  I know about the tax implications of Roth at the very least. Yeah it's just in brokerage. I haven't been putting more into it in the past few years because life happened, just into the 457 and 401k.

1lhcpym,2025-06-22,"What are your opinions on gold after the US decided to enter into war?
I feel like low key gold could high key be an excellent investment given the instability in the middle east and the fact that the most powerful nation in the world decided to get involved in the conflict. Regardless of whether or not you support those guys having WMDs, it's certainly alarming to see the recent escalation. It makes me think that we could see $5000 gold by the end of the year. I think it could be a very promising move, at least in the near term. Opinions?
Semantics.  The US hasn't formally declared war against a nation since 1942, but that didn't keep us from invading two countries and spending 20 years in Afghanistan. There will be headlines, stocks will over react, good time to buy with any cash or bonds you got. America bombs shit all the time bro. This is that panic they always warn ya about We have not “entered into war”, if you are meaning declaring war. Trump does not have that authority. But to answer your question, yes, I could see commodities doing well if things continue to escalate further. Time will tell. You’re right, I don’t disagree with you and have no argument against you on that. But it’s worth keeping the record straight to prevent the spread of bad information, even if by accident or mistake. Idk if the perpetual wars have desensitized you but attacking another nation is war, whether or not there’s an official declaration

That said gold isnt hitting 5k lol https://youtu.be/vl156QpXr5g?si=EwZGFuZtRjxpnDAr

Gold might see an uptick, but it's usually short lived. In terms of what to invest in, as long as US soil isn't getting directly attacked then equities tend to be safe and will normally recover within a year.

Expect global GDP to drop so it will have an overall effect, but usually countries not involved are the safest choice. Yeah, but usually it’s some ragtag terrorist group or some fringe army in some desert somewhere. It’s rare they bomb a major military power. Bombing Iran is not like bombing the Houthis or ISIS. The last time we did something like this was in Libya—and Libya was at least in the middle of a civil war. Hard to think of anything comparable for a generation.  Do me a favor and read about WWI…  the writing was on the wall, but somehow all decision makers missed the obvious outcome.

1lhc1fp,2025-06-22,"HSA Contribution Question
Hi Everyone, 

I have maxed out my “individual” contribution limit to my HSA for 2025. My fiance and I are getting married in December and once that happens, she will be added to my benefits package. 

Am I able to contribute the other $4200 ish to max out the “family” contribution limit before we are married as long as it’s in the account before December 1st? I currently have the money in savings ready to be deposited.

Thanks for the help.
Thanks for the info! I’ve been looking all over and that helps me a lot. 

I’ve had a HDHP for the last 6 years or so and I have been maxing out the individual contribution each year. Basically I keep my years worth max out of pocket deductible in cash in the account and the rest of it is invested in an s&p 500 mutual fund for long term growth. 

Once I we get married, the deductible will go up a few thousand dollars but will still be below the max threshold so about half of the money will go into the cash savings and the rest will be invested. 

Thanks for the help! For about the same amount of time, I’ve also had a Roth IRA that I contribute the max to every year and one of those early years I also opened a traditional IRA that I’ve contributed the max to 1 year and haven’t touch because, at the time when I was still learning some things, I didn’t realize the max contribution was combined in those accounts. 

I contribute 10% to my 401k each year with a 5% employer match and I’m about to start a brokerage account as well because I’m finding that as I move into my professional career, I have larger bonuses that I’d like to invest and for whatever reason, my employer won’t let us contribute bonus money to our 401k. 

I also have a 10 month cash savings emergency fund of about $50k in an HYSA earning 4% ($2000 per year) that I move over on January 1st to my Roth IRA every year to kick start the contribution. I’d really love to invest this “better” because I know what $50k could do in a brokerage account,  but based on what it’s for, I think it’s safest in an HYSA for now. Yo, first off — congrats on the upcoming wedding! December’s gonna come faster than you think, so props for already thinking ahead and stacking your HSA right. You’re on it.

Now about the contribution — you’re *almost* in the clear, but there’s a little twist. If you’re planning to max out the **family limit ($8,300 for 2025)**, then yeah, you technically can do that **if** you qualify as a family **by December 1st**, which you will once you're married. That falls under the “**last-month rule**” — meaning if you’re covered under a family HDHP plan by Dec 1, you can contribute the full family amount for the year.

BUT here’s the catch: under that rule, you’re also agreeing to stay eligible for **the next 12 months** (so all of 2026). If for some reason your coverage changes or you don’t stay on a family HDHP the whole next year, the IRS can claw back the extra contribution and hit you with penalties.

So yeah — you *can* drop that extra $4,200 before Dec 1, but make sure you’re good with that 12-month commitment rule. Maybe check in with a tax pro just to be safe, especially since you’ve already got the cash ready.

You planning to use the HSA strictly for medical stuff, or are you thinking long-term investing with it too? [deleted] You're welcome man — you’re honestly managing this like a pro. That balance of keeping the deductible in cash and letting the rest ride in the S&P? It’s clean, efficient, and way ahead of how most folks treat their HSAs. You’d be surprised how many people just let that account sit doing nothing.

I’m 35 now — started out rough, dropped out of uni, built a clothing brand from the ground up, and kinda stumbled my way into investing along the journey. Hit my first mil not too long ago, and weirdly, a lot of that didn’t come from stocks or ETFs, it was actually from a small slice of my portfolio that I let my crypto investment manager handle. I gave him a few grand to play with early on, and over the years, the way he rotated through altcoins and stable income plays... man, it quietly outpaced everything else I was doing. Didn’t expect it to become my top passive income stream, but here we are.

I’m always trying to learn from people who’ve been consistent with long-term growth though — especially folks like you who’ve been stacking with discipline for years. Besides the HSA, what else are you building toward? Got a Roth, brokerage, or maybe some real estate in the pipeline? That’s a proper setup, Respect where it’s due, your system’s tight. Not perfect (none of ours are), but clearly intentional. That bit about the traditional and Roth IRA mix-up? You’re not alone, I did something similar when I first got into this, except my mistake was trying to swing a bunch of different accounts without knowing how they actually tax me on the backend. Rookie days.

Now me? I didn’t really grow up around this stuff. Dropped out of uni, started flipping fabrics and built my brand from scratch — that’s where most of my capital came from. I wasn’t maxing IRAs back then… I was just trying to make rent while saving up for my first house. It was crypto, of all things, that ended up being the wildcard. Gave a guy I trusted around £12K to manage a side portfolio for me, and a few altcoin rotations later? That bag’s sitting over £80K. Totally passive.

1lhavdk,2025-06-22,"What will the market do Monday after attack on Iran?
Obviously this is a breaking development and there will be a lot of uncertainly over the next 24 hours. I assume oil will go up and any highly oil contingent industries will drop.

1lh9zol,2025-06-21,"Investing crypto in portfolio management platforms a good idea?
Investing in some portfolio management and using their prebuilt strategies like DAC, grid bot etc, is it worth it?

I am looking forward to investing 3k in it. I would like to know if it is a good decision or not and are there returns?

Is the investment safe?

I tried some bots online, but it is all a sca,m especially volatile markets like the meme coin market.

Don't know any good copy trading platform that does automated copy trading platform that does automated trading in futures or spot and is effective. I am expecting normal returns.

I tried copy trading on finance,, but it wasn't as good or safe as it should be given the return ratio and the PNL ratio of traders there.
Just buy some Bitcoin and hold it in a hardware wallet.

Don't over complicate it thinking it needs to be traded or you need to go all in on altcoins and no bitcoin etc etc.

In crypto you either learn to buy Bitcoin or you rage quit this market and blame it on Bitcoin when you had none. You’re overthinking this. Just buy and hold bitcoin long term. Yo I’ve been down that rabbit hole too — bots, copy trading, all the prebuilt stuff like DAC, grid strategies, you name it. Sounds good in theory, but once you’re in the trenches with real money? Whole different game, especially in volatile markets.

I actually tested a grid bot with around £5K a while back — had some calm gains early on, but once the market flipped? It started DCA’ing into losses like it was trying to dig its own grave 😅. Pulled out before it got ugly, and that move alone made me *so* glad I’ve got an investment manager handling my main crypto portfolio now. At least I know someone’s actually thinking, not just running on autopilot.

With your $3K, I’d say split it smart. Maybe park a good chunk into solid plays like BTC, ETH, or even ETFs if you’re playing the long game — then test these auto-strategies with a smaller slice, like $500 tops. Treat it like a learning expense, not your main vehicle.

Copy trading platforms? I haven’t found one that’s both consistent and safe for futures. Binance had potential, but most traders there are just chasing a lucky streak — barely anyone managing real risk, let alone long-term growth.

So is it “worth it”? Depends. If you treat it like an experiment and keep your expectations realistic — sure. But if you’re hoping for hands-off, stable returns? I'd steer toward things with more structure and a human behind the wheel.

1lh3tsf,2025-06-21,"Lumpsum inheritance vs keep for rental property
So in a situation where my parents passed away and their home, still having an $80,000 mortgage on a (Zillow) value of $270,000.

My current situation is 38 year old with ~$600,000 in investments between 401k, Roth IRA, Crypto, brokerage, HSA, and HYSA.  Currently I'm fortunate enough to max out my 401k, Roth IRA for myself and spouse, max HSA, and have some extra I put into brokerage accounts monthly. Also we have a primary residence with a mortgage at 3.375% interest, current mortgage value is around 50% of current home vaule.

I'm trying to decide on of I should sell the inherited home and take the lump sum to invest in brokerage or keep the house as a rental property.  Based on my numbers I think I have to get a new mortgage on the rental property around $120,000 to do some home improvements before it's ready to rent.  Expected rent would be around $1,800-$1,900 and I would prefer to use a property management company to stay as hands off as I could.

My mind is telling me it's be good to keep property as a rental for future passive income and maybe the first stepping stone into a few rentals down the line.  However it's hard for me to not just take the lump sum and grow it at 7%-10% per year in the market.

Looking for any opinions that I'm missing to help with decision.  Thanks for reading.
Getting another mortgage and turning it into more renal homes is taking on a lot of leverage, and I don’t think managing rentals is as passive as finance YouTubers make it seem. You absolutely have the opportunity to turn this inheritance into another job… but do you need/want to?

It looks to me like you’re in a decent enough spot financially already to not worry about squeezing out every penny. 7-10% is ambitious, but I’d still put it in the market if I was in your shoes. Just this random guy’s 2¢. If the house is nearby, in a decent neighborhood, has reasonable insurance costs, doesn’t need any major updates, you are a bit handy with painting and basic maintenance, and have enough time etc.. maybe rent it out. But if it’s more than a 20 minute drive and you will have to hire maintenance crews for everything as well as a property manager you should consider liquidating. Sell it and invest the proceeds. Rental property is just another headache. While rental sounds cool, unless you are active on the rental it is a waste of money. Rental means headache as you have to deal with problems as they arise. If there is a single house rolling the costs becomes more complicated. If you plan on having a bunch of rentals then why not.

Saying that you will have a property management company begs me to ask, ""so whats your added value?"" 

Now wrt to growing 7 to 10 per year. Sure that's a nice dream. The market has been ludicrously silly and there will be a drop. I would sell the house and move along. BTW sorry to hear that your parents passed away with you being 38. That's sucks. I’d sell.  We had an inherited home free and clear. Iwe got about 1800/month after broker fees and we lived 5 hours away.  To me, maybe not to you, I want to be able to cover the normal home owner expenses PLUS cover the major repairs ( hvac, carpet, paint, water heater, stove, roof deck etc) in the future

Even without a mortgage I calculated if we sold the house and only made 4% return on the money, investing it would bring in more money after 1 year that if we kept it. 

It’s little things, $1800 to have a tree removed, that would/could quickly eat up your profit.  A roof or deck replacement would eat up almost a years worth. 

Very happy to sell and not have to worry every time the broker called about what broke now or you could sell the home to a family who plans on living in it Appreciate the response.  My ""best case scenario"" is obtain a 30 yr mortgage and using rental income have mortgage paid off in 15 years.  Lining up around same time as when I'm looking to early retire, 15-17 years.  Then the property full rental income could be used a passive income to ease that transition.

Again all just thoughts in my head.  Having additional properties isn't necessarily something I WANT to do, but if lemons to lemonade situation happens cool. You should a trusted pro to do some financial planning. This doesn’t mean you have to have them manage your money. But let them map things out for you. 

If you’re maxing 401ks and still are under limit for backdoor, that means you live very frugal. Great. 

My gut says sell and invest as it is easier, being a landlord sucks. But try for a while. I bet you don’t like it. If there was a good tenant there already, maybe. But as soon as someone doesn’t pay, you’re out the window on cash flow. A roof. An HVAC.

But you should have at least one or two financial pros you trust and respect to discuss things with. It’s like having a good attorney or CPA. Even if you don’t hire them, you should know some. Yeah seems general consensus in this thread is to take the money.  I do see the easy and safe path that is, I just wanted to hear others opinions.

1lh2vdf,2025-06-21,"Yelp Might be Undervalued by 15% - 20%
Yelp has been a public company for over a decade now. It makes most of its money from advertising and while it hasn't flourished like Google or Meta, neither has it totally faded. I spent some time digging through the numbers and running  a traditional DCF and here are my thoughts. 

* Yelp generated $1.4 billion in revenues in 2024 but growth has slowed down significantly - to single digits 
* Its operating margins are improving - from 5% in 2022 to over 10% in 2025. In my model, I assume margins continue to rise and eventually settle around 18%. That’s still modest compared to Google (\~32%) and Meta (\~41%).
* Revenue is driven by two key metrics: Ad Clicks and CPCs (cost per click)
* Ad Clicks increased in 2024, but CPCs remained flat. I found that a bit odd, especially since the number of businesses advertising on Yelp has slightly declined. My theory: Yelp is doing some search arbitrage - buying cheap clicks on platforms such as Google/Meta, then reselling that traffic through its own higher-priced sponsored listings. 
* Lastly, Yelp is a controversial company - [South Park once dedicated an entire episode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%27re_Not_Yelping) to mocking it and there's even a Kickstarter-funded documentary called - [Billion Dollar Bully ](https://tubitv.com/movies/520879/billion-dollar-bully) \- that questions its business practices.  Online forums are littered with accusations of pushy sales tactics and pay-to-play schemes. Yelp denies these allegations, and to be fair, has never been reprimanded by the courts. They operate in a tricky area of maintaining a ""fair"" review system, so this kinda backlash isn't totally unexpected. 

Based on my analysis, I think Yelp is worth about $38/share  - with upside scenarios pushing it past $40. It's currently trading at $34/share. 

Would love to hear what ya'll think. Yelp in not a buzzy stock anymore but there might be some hidden value here. 
Do you or anyone you know still use yelp? Fuck yelp, they bully small businesses. Fuck Yelp.

1lgzzs4,2025-06-21,"Potential conflict of interest from wealth management company
Hey folks, my girlfriend recently asked me to take a look at her managed investment portfolio to get a second opinion, and I found something a bit strange. A sizable amount of her portfolio was recently invested in a very new ""actively managed fund"" that I had never heard of, ticker FFOX.

Upon further inspection, there are a few odd things that jumped out:  
\- 1% Expense Ratio.  
\- Nearly half of the fund is just a collection of other ETFs.  
\- It is owned and managed by the same wealth management company.  
\- The expense ratio is buried way at the bottom of the fund’s site, and holdings are listed alphabetically (so it’s easy to miss that most of the fund is just other ETFs).

After I learned this, I asked my girlfriend to get in touch with her parents, who use the same wealth management company, and it turns out they also have a chunky amount of money invested in this fund. Neither of them were informed about this move.

This strikes me as a massive conflict of interest, and straight up shady business practice. I have never worked with a wealth advisor, so before I raise the alarm bells, I just wanted to check in here -- am I misinterpreting anything, or does this indeed feel like a huge red flag?
Common. No different than active management just buying voo They are already being paid a percentage fee for assets under management. So charging a 1% expense ratio on top of that for a not-quite-so-actively-managed fund is still common? Sort of. Most places charge more than 1%. So it’s the same in the end. It's not uncommon for a managed account to be invested in positions from the same company, nor for a fund to be invested in sub-advisor positions rather than being invested in the underlying securities directly. 

That can be like, ""Here's what we think the best *strategic* plan is moving forward, the *tactical* (specific) bits we'll delegate to sub-funds.""

There are also times where the gross expense ratio is discounted to a lower net, if that position is held by the parent wealth management company.

As always, good to read the prospectus, understand costs versus what you're getting, and decide whether it's still a good plan forward. OP: You have discovered closet indexing. You are looking at a ""proprietary"" fund with active management level fees that contains a large portion of passive funds.

As far as conflicts of interest go, those are endemic to investing. You did the work. You see the conflict. The hard part is that there is no way to avoid it. Either you DIY investing or you pay higher fees. 

You should feel good about what you have observed. Your investing prowess has improved. What people don't understand it that ""financial advisory"" and ""wealth management"" is often just a sales job; the top prodicers are the top sales people. It's not about producing results.

It's sad.

At the end of the day your gf and her family have made some choices, they need to live with those choices.

And if they claim that they don't know any better [checking my watch] it's 2025, better get educated about finances. Incredibly. That's why there's such an anti-advisor sentiment in finance communities. 

Read through Form CRS and ADV part 2 and you'll find all sorts of details about how these firms are compensated in ways you didn't expect. 

If you're aware of this and want to find someone who doesn't do it, it's very difficult. But here are some places to look:

You are paying a wealth management company to manage your money and they naturaly use their funds to do so.  How could that be a conflict of interest?

Forget this useless line of thinking.  Either the company is getting you a return worth what they are charging you, or get another company, or do it yourself. I wouldn’t be ok with that.

This is a terrible idea >than sell as needed and setup it up to pay things like a credit card?

Where is the money coming from if you’re not selling Please point out where you said “checking and other jobs” in the original post So you didn’t. And now are pissed off because people can’t read your mind? A regular taxable Fidelity account will do most or all of what you appear to want with no fees.

You can have direct deposit sent there and it will go to the settlement MMF. You can set up scheduled auto buys of ETFs and stocks. The money for purchases will draw from the settlement MMF. The settlement MMF (SPAXX) currently yields \~3.9%. The auto investments can also be set up to draw from a linked bank account.

The account also has optional access to paper checks, online bill pay, and a debit card. Those all draw from the settlement MMF. If you get their credit card that can be paid from the settlement MMF. There are no fees for the optional features.

You will have to find out from Fidelity how long they will hold direct deposits before the money can be withdrawn. IIRC, if you ACH transfer from your bank to Fidelity the hold is 7 days. If you initiate the ACH transfer at Fidelity to pull from your bank account the hold can be much longer. Don't do that. oh yeah, i am in college (for accounting and cybersecurity) and therefore can afford to mess up, but I know that this is the number one way to build wealth, some other guy just started to lecture me like i was an idiot, thanks for actually answering lol I saw his reply. I think you two misunderstood each other is all. 

He thinks you get paycheck for 2k. You set VOO auto buy for 2k. You set bill pay for credit card, so the account has to auto liquidate VOO to pay credit card. That would be no bueno and what he was describing. 

But it doesn’t have to be this way. Credit card is $500. Your direct deposit if 2k. Auto buy VOO for $500, 1500 is money market earning decent interest. Credit card or whatever is paid from money market. Fidelity is great for this. 

It beats using a regular bank that gives 0.03 on idle cash. 

He was just telling you not to constantly sell to pay bills. Which is correct (not smart tax wise). You will learn and find what works for you. 

But you are correct. You want to learn this early. Best of luck!! what is the focus of QQQM (i was going to split between VOO, VOOG, and SPY, but i know they are all ETFs with different focuses) Pretty much all of them honestly. Fidelity is extra easy. Set automatic buys for ETF’s you want. The extra money would be in their money market auto. 

You can direct deposit in there and bill pay from it. You would just need to make sure you don’t over invest and have enough in money market to handle the bill pay debits. 

Pretty much all of the big brokers do this. Just not sure what their policy is with spendable money market for idle cash. Most allow a daily/weekly/monthly scheduled deposit to auto buy in according to instructions. Mine will buy monthly a basket for ETFs in a set ratio. Any left over is earning interest until it reaches minimum buy ($100) for me.

I can set a sell and have it take a set proportion from the holdings to keep them in the proportions I set e.g. Withdraw $10k and it figures out how much of each holding to sell to get me $10k cash without changing ratio of holdings.",0,0.5,33,0,Spanconstant5,investing,['C'],brokerage automatic buys sells income expenses wondering brokerage could set paycheck direct deposit automatically invested etfs sell needed setup pay things like credit card account exist anyway could set account parts shouldnt trading funds need pay bills next month terrible idea sell needed setup pay things like credit card money coming youre selling please point said checking jobs original post didnt pissed people cant read mind regular taxable fidelity account appear want fees direct deposit sent go settlement mmf set scheduled auto buys etfs stocks money purchases draw settlement mmf settlement mmf spaxx currently yields 39 auto investments also set draw linked bank account account also optional access paper checks online bill pay debit card draw settlement mmf get credit card paid settlement mmf fees optional features find fidelity long hold direct deposits money withdrawn iirc ach transfer bank fidelity hold 7 days initiate ach transfer fidelity pull bank account hold much longer dont oh yeah college accounting cybersecurity therefore afford mess know number one way build wealth guy started lecture like idiot thanks actually answering lol saw reply think two misunderstood thinks get paycheck 2k set voo auto buy 2k set bill pay credit card account auto liquidate voo pay credit card would bueno describing doesnt way credit card 500 direct deposit 2k auto buy voo 500 1500 money market earning decent interest credit card whatever paid money market fidelity great beats using regular bank gives 003 idle cash telling constantly sell pay bills correct smart tax wise learn find works correct want learn early best luck focus qqqm going split voo voog spy know etfs different focuses pretty much honestly fidelity extra easy set automatic buys etfs want extra money would money market auto direct deposit bill pay would need make sure dont invest enough money market handle bill pay debits pretty much big brokers sure policy spendable money market idle cash allow dailyweeklymonthly scheduled deposit auto buy according instructions mine buy monthly basket etfs set ratio left earning interest reaches minimum buy 100 set sell take set proportion holdings keep proportions set eg withdraw 10k figures much holding sell get 10k cash without changing ratio holdings

I’m 31M with a 403b through work. They contribute 10% I contribute 5% for a 15% total and I currently have contributions going 100% in FXAIX and it has performed great so far. I also max out my Roth and current allocations are: 50% VTI, 30%QQQM, 10% FEPI, 10% TSLA. Wondering if I should get more aggressive with what I buy in my Roth (like buy more individual stocks) since I already have a solid set up in my 403b (that also overlaps) or if I should just stick the course.
I’d stick with what you’re doing. Also, god damn 10% from your employer, Jesus. Keep that job for sure. Mirror them.  Time is your friend.  Volatility is not.

Slow and steady wins the race.  Don't get FOMO.  If you feel the need to invest in ""hot stocks"" set a couple of grand aside in a brokerage and have at it their.  This way, you scratch that it but still keep building for the future.  I'd even pull the TSLA out of my Roth.  Index funds only. > 10% TSLA.

That's pretty aggressive. Hopefully your cost basis is very low. How long ago did you buy?

> Wondering if I should get more aggressive

Depends on your expertise, analysis of present conditions and the future, and - of course - your tolerance for risk.

> since I already have a solid set up in my 403b (that also overlaps) or if I should just stick the course.

1lgyeji,2025-06-21,"Is it worth investing if I have very little upfront?
I’ve always been told to only invest what I’m willing to lose. With that in mind, I really can’t do more than a couple of thousand right now. Is it even worth it if that’s all I have to start with? Or should I continue to save and invest when I have more upfront? 

Also, is now a horrific time to begin investing considering the current politics? I know very little so would love to hear thoughts! 

Thank you!! 
The sooner you start the better. It will add up over time just never sell. Yes, every millionaire has to start somewhere. I started out saving/investing a few hundred a month in my early 20’s. Then a thousand a month. Then a few thousand a month. 12 years later and now I’m a millionaire. 

The only invest what you’re willing to lose advice only applies to risky stocks or crypto. It doesn’t apply to index funds like the S&P 500. Stock to index funds. 

It’s always a good time to invest. Doesn’t matter the president. Yes dont start selling until retirement is probably better advice for most people than ""never"" sell. Although if you are lucky enough to have more funds than you need in retirement then never selling could be prudent as you can transfer those securities to your heirs upon death tax free and with stepped up basis. Depends on your financial needs and goals. 

Assuming you have an emergency fund, paid off credit cards and overall in a decent spot, then 100% yes! Keep it simple, buy a low cost market ETF like VOO and just keep dollar cost averaging (aka buying) in strong and weak markets. 

The goal is not to need to pull money out during short term challenges ie down market, lost a job, need to pay the bills. The longer you can leave it, the more it compounds and snowballs. The first $10k is harder than the next. The first $100k is harder than the next. The first million is harder than the next!

Build some good habits, don’t let lifestyle inflation hit too much if you get a better paying job or see larger numbers in investment accounts, and good luck!!! You have to sell someday, otherwise what is the point Its like the marshmallow question we give kids to outline delayed gratification.

Would you rather have 1 marshmallow now or 3 marshmallows later?

If you have a 30 yr horizon and we are really lucky and get 7% real returns (10% nominal, 3% inflation), then your $2,000 now will multiply 7.6x (in todays dollars) or 17.5x nominally. That will be like having $15,224 in todays purchasing power.

If you wait to start investing next year, thats only 7.1x, so only $14,228. If you wait two years, thats 6.6x, so $13,297.

If you wait until 10 years away, you have more sequence of returns risk and even if you get that steady geometric return, youre only going to 1.97x your money in inflation adjusted terms, so you'd need to personally save much more to reach the same required nest egg.


Its difficult to think about, but every single dollar matters, and the earlier that dollar is invested, the more it will be worth in the future. You should absolutely invest extra money now, even if its not much. We live in the era of commission free brokerages Make sure you have an emergency fund in a high yield savings account. 

You don’t want to start buying index funds just to sell them 6 months later at a loss. 

As long as you have an emergency fund though, absolutely invest any amount you can. Do index funds, not individual stocks, and plan to basically never sell. You’re keeping those for decades. There’s never a better time to start than today. 

Remember “time in the market is better than timing the market.” Yes pick a low cost S&P 500 fund index fund like VOO and just buy as much as you can every month. The standard advice is to open a Roth IRA and contribute the max every year, and everything else put in a taxable brokerage account. Thank you so much for this!! That feels doable and less scary. Would love to hear your thoughts on where I should start- best to just throw it all in SPY and let it sit? VOO and SPY are super similar. I’d recommend VOO personally (or VTI, which is the whole market, not just the biggest 500 companies), but either of them is fine and is good enough.

1lgwjn2,2025-06-21,"Employer stop contributing to my 401k
I've been giving the max allowed, 22%. Their agreement doesn't allow me to withdraw my funds while I'm still employed. Although, I can stop contributing. I also don't have a choice and what they invest in. Of course it's not growing very fast, barely keeping up with inflation.

Should I stop contributing and send that money to my taxable brokerage account? I believe there are some protections built into money inside of 401k versus a brokerage account. But I'm 58 years old and I hope to retire in four or five years and I need growth right now.
”I also don't have a choice and what they invest in.” is this common? I’ve experienced 401k plans at 5 different companies and I never seen where you don’t have multiple choices? They are not always great choices but I always been able to pick between several investment alternatives. If you’re retiring in 4-5 years you should be de-risking not increasing risk. Have you spoken with a financial planner? Reddit isn't a financial planner? It is rare but they do exist.

I am old so some history.  Employers used to do sleazy things with 401k's and pensions.  Like their stock was the investment.   so after lawsuits the government set a standard and made the employers responsible.

1 option has to be a cash/money market investment.  zero risk. and it is the default. 

then there can be risky investments, but they should be varying levels.   so a mix of conservative, aggressive, and bond fund.   so there was a standard 4-5 fund offering that every employer adopted

but it does not have to be a mix of funds.   if it is a no risk investment that has a stable return they are fine.   there seems to be a trend of wealth management companies offering this type of 401k's to employers.  and some companies are going with them.   my guess is that this is smaller companies doing it and they have other financial relationships tied to getting their 401k business. There are so many problems with this post, I don't know where to start. Yeah that doesn’t add up. He has to have investment choices or it’s a breach of fiduciary duty.
Edit- potentially a breach of fiduciary. I could make the argument. Don’t know if I’d win. Source - I’m a lawyer and on a 401k committee. I mean if you’re wrong enough, a real expert can’t help but chime in.  I’ve also never worked for a company that completely barred you from withdrawing during your employment - especially because, as OP pointed out, there is no employer match so those funds are 100% his with no “vesting window” to account for… this has serious fraud vibes.

Why would any employee even choose to participate in this vs managing a private retirement fund on their own? If there is no employer match this 401k program offers nothing but downsides. OP has 30+ years in retirement so OP should be investing.  Too late for his 401k if it's barely better than inflation.

OP needs a fiduciary. I don’t know how long OP has worked here but I’m assuming it defaulted to a target date fund hence the relatively low returns as of late.

DOMESTIC:
- 60% | SPTM - TOTAL US MARKET

- 5% | QTUM - INTL MACHINE LEARNING

I have UTES/XAR/QTUM/FTWO as my tinkering/fun part of the portfolio, also somewhat of a defensive core against market crash. Should I get rid of this and simply reallocate to total market funds for long term growth?

I have CLOZ/FSCO as purely a safety net of capital preservation & compounding dividends. I currently have about 140 shares of both which nets me 1 share of each fund every month.

I feel like I have the basis of what I want to invest in listed, but I also feel like it may be too complicated to keep in balance.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
Where's the magic the gather final fantasy collector boosters 30-40 years is quite a long time. Current expectations are for international to outperform US over the next decade so maybe drop all that defense for a solid offense FTSE 100 Europe, Asia, Brazil, etc. At that time horizon fees could be a drag, compare your current holdings with other equivalent funds that may have lower fees. > defensive core against market crash

Your defense against market crashes is the fact that you have 30-40 years. The market can (and will) crash over and over and over; it's not a big deal. Forget UTES, XAR, QTUM, and FTWU.

> I have CLOZ/CLOX/FSCO/OUNZ as purely a safety net of capital preservation

Also totally unnecessary. If this is for 30-40 years from now there's zero need to worry about capital preservation. Time is your friend. Over-diversified…by a lot. Sure, portfolio back-testing is a thing. E.g. here:

https://testfol.io/

Though you will be limited by how long some of those specific ETF's have existed. ETF's haven't been around long in general, and something like QTUM has only been around since 2018. 

So you may be best off finding something similar with a longer history, if it exists. Or looking at simple proportions of various asset classes.

You can also look at general performance trends for sectors. I believe this should be accessible without a Fidelity account or login:

https://digital.fidelity.com/prgw/digital/research/sector

Utilities as a sector are way behind the S&P on the whole, on a 10-year basis. Dramatically behind tech, semi-conductors, etc.

There are of course times when utilities or consumer staples outperform the broader market, like in a recession. They're good defensive moves. But giving up a lot of performance over the course of a full business cycle. I think you should go visit r/bogleheads and learn about their perspective a little, if you aren’t already familiar. Especially since you seem to be going the index route already (good choice). This will orient you enough to put together some styles to align with your long term plan. In general, I am a bit biased (I’m very likely the most concentrated investor here - 2 companies), but you’ll probably do best with an SP500 index fund, a small allocation to international, a small cash position, and a cash emergency fund…Those are not in order(!), and this is not investment advice. It’s just an example of what I might set up for someone I know absolutely nothing about. 

**This should be individualized more than most know, but it is not too complicated to take care of yourself**…Don’t let the responses made here, in jest, dissuade you; you could easily lose hundreds of thousands to fees and opportunity costs over the course of a career. You can do this, just think about the life you’d like to live and adjust your method accordingly. Visit the bogleheads then talk to an LLM about your plans and desires in the context of your newfound knowledge. **Either use the LLM or do this yourself, but plug in some numbers and look at different scenarios over time to help further gain understanding. If/when you speak to a professional to check yourself, make sure they are a fee-only fiduciary.**

Edit: Changed “it” to “your method” and fixed a few typos for clarity. Rather than going to r/bogleheads, OP might be better served by first going to the source, Bogle’s own book. 

https://a.co/d/iuqCIpl I wish there was an audio book version read by Bogle himself. He had a great 'radio voice,' right up till the end. You don't need to modify anything. You don't need to overthink and overcomplicate this. Simple is good.

And until your portfolio is in the $100k-200k range, the amount you can save and contribute will make more difference than overcomplicating your actual investments. Overcomplicated.

1lhj1w2,2025-06-22,"U.S. hits Iranian nuclear sites. What’s your plan?
So yeah… looks like shit’s escalating fast.

U.S. just hit 3 Iranian nuclear facilities (Natanz, Fordow, Isfahan) with bombers and bunker busters. Iran launched missiles back at Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, people injured, and more threats coming. This isn’t just a proxy conflict anymore, this is getting real.

Gold already popped. Oil’s moving. USD spiked a bit but feels like a mix of risk-off and rate expectations now. I'm wondering what you guys think


Curious how you’re all trading this. Do you already have positions or are you waiting for confirmation?

It's not all out war so not much it's just short term noise. We will probably see a small dip 2-3% and recover within a week, it's really just irrelevant unless things escalate much further. Oil it is. Strait of Hormuz is less than 100km wide and ASMs have ranges of around 200km plus they can also use simpler things like RPGs from Speedboats. Point is, ship traffic through the strait will become uninsurable and therefore largely cease.

Funny thing how the one profiteur of this mess is Krasnovs overlord in Moscow. Nothing burger. Buy the dip. Close the thread Is this a geo-political take or from the “keep buying the dip, it will go up forever” mantra?  How many two week long tactical bombing events have we seen end up as short term noise?  You can tell from Israel’s own comms this isn’t about nuclear weapons, this is about triggering a regime change.  By most neutral accounts Iranians have rallied behind the supreme leader.  Is there a chance it fizzles out?  Yes, but history tells us different Well, everyone is bearish now so I buy. Israel flattened Gaza and Syria and marktes went up.

(Reuters) – A U.S. strike on Iran’s nuclear sites is expected to spark immediate market turbulence, with oil prices likely to jump and investors fleeing to safe-haven assets, analysts said, as they weighed the broader economic fallout. President Donald Trump announced the attack on Truth Social, confirming the destruction of Iran’s key nuclear enrichment facilities and warning of more strikes if peace is not reached. The move deepens U.S. involvement in the Middle East and raises uncertainty ahead of the market open. “Oil will open higher,” said Mark Spindel of Potomac River Capital, citing volatility and concern over escalation. Rising oil prices could also drive inflation, undermining consumer confidence and delaying rate cuts.

1lhein4,2025-06-22,"Iran war, Back to nuclear: Supply Chain and Stocks of The Inglorious Basterds: Uranium, Plutonium and Thorium

The uranium supply chain is a multi-step global process, beginning with mining and ending with nuclear energy production or waste disposal. Uranium is mainly mined in Kazakhstan, Canada, and Australia. After extraction, it’s processed into yellowcake (U3O8), converted to uranium hexafluoride gas (UF6), enriched to boost U-235 levels, and fabricated into fuel rods for nuclear reactors. Spent fuel becomes radioactive waste, which is stored, reprocessed, or permanently disposed of.

Kazakhstan supplies over 43% of the world’s uranium. Other key producers include Canada, Namibia, and Australia. However, many rely on countries like the U.S., France, and Russia for enrichment and fuel fabrication. The uranium trade is tightly regulated due to its potential use in nuclear weapons.

North American investment is centered on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The TSX specializes in uranium exploration, particularly in Canada’s Athabasca Basin, home to the highest-grade uranium globally. Major TSX-listed companies include Cameco, NexGen Energy, Denison Mines, Fission Uranium, and Global Atomic.

On the NYSE, uranium firms focus on production, enrichment, and fuel supply. Cameco is dual-listed, while Energy Fuels runs the only conventional U.S. uranium mill. Uranium Energy Corp (UEC) leads in in-situ recovery and physical uranium holdings. Centrus Energy offers enrichment services. Companies like Denison and NexGen connect Canadian exploration with U.S. capital.

As Western nations seek to reduce reliance on Russian nuclear materials, these firms gain strategic value. Explorers like Fission and Global Atomic are also drawing investor interest amid tightening global supply and rising demand from China and Europe.

Recent geopolitical tensions have further shaken the uranium market. On June 21, President Donald Trump announced that U.S. forces carried out major strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, core sites in Iran’s uranium enrichment program. B-2 bombers and over 30 Tomahawk missiles, launched with Israeli coordination, dealt a heavy blow to Iran’s nuclear capabilities.

“These were massive precision strikes,” Trump said, calling the attack a joint effort with Israel and warning of further action if peace doesn’t follow. While Iran isn’t a top uranium supplier, the strike highlights the vulnerability of enrichment infrastructure and raises the stakes in the region. The attack could delay Iran’s nuclear ambitions and prompt renewed interest in supply security and Western uranium projects.

Plutonium, unlike uranium and thorium, isn’t mined. It’s produced in reactors from used uranium fuel and can be reprocessed into MOX fuel. France, Russia, and Japan engage in this practice, though many countries avoid it due to weapons risk. Most plutonium work is government-run. A rare public stock with indirect exposure is BWX Technologies (NYSE), linked to U.S. naval programs.

Thorium is more abundant than uranium and mined with rare earths. It can’t be used directly in reactors and must be converted to uranium-233, a process still in development. India, China, and Norway are leading thorium research due to its safety and low-waste potential. No commercial thorium reactors exist yet. Companies like Ucore Rare Metals (TSX) and Energy Fuels (NYSE) offer limited exposure through rare earth processing.

In summary, uranium remains the core fuel for nuclear power, with significant investment opportunities on the TSX and NYSE. Plutonium is limited to state-led use, while thorium holds long-term potential but is not yet viable commercially. The U.S. strike on Iran’s nuclear sites underscores the geopolitical risks tied to uranium infrastructure and strengthens the investment case for secure, Western-aligned uranium supply chains.

Meanwhile, Kazakhstan and China have expanded energy ties, signing $25 billion in deals, including uranium development. China, with 27 reactors under construction and 150 planned by 2035, is set to become the world’s nuclear demand center. Kazakhstan, though not a nuclear power user, is a key supplier and partner. Trade between the two reached $44 billion in 2024, with Belt and Road investments turning Kazakhstan into a vital Central Asian energy hub.

1lhdz1a,2025-06-22,"Investors brace for oil price spike, rush to havens after US bombs Iran nuclear sites


“Before the U.S. attack on Saturday, analysts at Oxford Economics modeled three scenarios, including a de-escalation of the conflict, a complete shutdown in Iranian oil production and a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, ""each with increasingly large impacts on global oil prices.""

“In the most severe case, global oil prices jump to around $130 per barrel, driving U.S. inflation near 6% by the end of this year, Oxford said in the note.”

""Although the price shock inevitably dampens consumer spending because of the hit to real incomes, the scale of the rise in inflation and concerns about the potential for second-round inflation effects likely ruin any chance of rate cuts in the U.S. this year,"" Oxford said in the note, which was published before the U.S. strikes.”

“In comments after the announcement on Saturday, Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group, agreed oil prices would likely spike on the initial news. But Cox said he expected prices to likely level in a few days as the attacks could lead Iran to seek a peace deal with Israel and the United States.
""With this demonstration of force and total annihilation of its nuclear capabilities, they’ve lost all of their leverage and will likely hit the escape button to a peace deal,"" Cox said.
Economists warn that a dramatic rise in oil prices could damage a global economy already strained by Trump's tariffs.”

“Still, any pullback in equities might be fleeting, history suggests. During past prominent instances of Middle East tensions coming to a boil, including the 2003 Iraq invasion and the 2019 attacks on Saudi oil facilities, stocks initially languished but soon recovered to trade higher in the months ahead.
On average, the S&P 500 slipped 0.3% in the three weeks following the start of conflict, but was 2.3% higher on average two months following the conflict, according to data from Wedbush Securities and CapIQ Pro.”


“Bar chart showing The S&P 500 has tended to languish in the immediate weeks following major past episodes of Middle East conflicts, but has recovered in subsequent months.”

First of all, I don't want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it reflects closing prices from June. 13 to June 20. 

It was a quiet and flat week. The S&P 500 lost 0.15%. However, Nasdaq gained 0.21% and Dow gained 0.02%.

Here are the S&P 500's week-by-week results,

May. 30 close at 5,911.69 - June 6 close at 6,000.36 🟢 (+1.49%)

June 6 close at 6,000.36 - June 13 close at 5,976.97 🔴 (-0.38%)

June 13 close at 5,976.97 - June 20 close at 5,967.84 🔴 (-0.15%)

🔸 Monday: The most important event was FOMC meeting in this week. On the other hand, Trump called for peace deal between Iran and Israel. The stock market opened higher more than 0.5%. During the session, we heard positive news about war. Iran wanted a ceasefire and resume to nuclear talks. The stock market closed higher around 1%. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: Before the session, retail sales and import/export price index data were released. These industrial datas came below expectations and it's a sign of economic weakness. Trump cut G7 trip due to Middle Easy situtation. He also said EU is not offering fair trade. As we know, when we heard negative news about tariffs, the stock market goes to negatively. The stock market opened lower. During the session, Trum said ""Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran"" and called ""unconditional surrender"" for Iran's. The stock market closed lower. 🔴

🔸 Wednesday: Sure, Iran's Khamenei rejected Trump's surrender call. The stock market opened slightly higher before the FOMC meeting. Silver hit the highest level since 2012 at $37. I'm following gold and silver, so I have not been writting about other precious metals like palladium. As expected, Fed held interest rate steady. Jerome Powell talked about many topics. He still wants to wait of result of tariffs. Also, the expected rate cut count dropped 2 to 1 in 2025. The S&P 500 closed down just 0.04%. 🔴

🔸 Thursday: Holiday.

🔸 Friday: Interestingly, Fed's Waller said central bank could cut rates as early as July. Sure, the stock market liked this and opened higher around 0.5%. However, during the session, Fed's Barkin said nothing urgent in data warranting a rate cut at this point. Also, Friday was Triple Witching Day which can create high volatility. As a result, the stock market lost its gains and closed lower. 🔴

Despite the FOMC meeting, it was a fairly quiet week. CME FedWatch Tool (you can find via Google search) currently shows no rate cut expected in 2025. As Trump mentioning, is Powell late? What do you think? How was your week?

1lhhso2,2025-06-22,"Stepped away from trading for two years. Did I miss the golden age of pennies this last year?
Seeing stocks like $asts and rklb have mooned. Other stocks like $mvst, $apld and other up big too. They fit a recent theme of space, batteries,and robotics. It’s looking like any in those sectors have already taken off out of penny land or $1-$2 range.

Are there still pennies/good stocks in thematic sectors left or have I missed the boat?
Most of us are posting from private South Sea Islands we bought with the proceeds of our YOLO trades Last year was fun, almost doubled my portfolio in December alone.

It seems like some penny stocks are still shooting up these days, so I don’t think you’ve missed it all. oh no shit? I'm down here, too. Which island did you buy? You are a little late, but you still have tons of upside with ELTP. With the new BE approval, my exit value went from $3.60 to $9. Kopn 
Back up the truck Missed the boat. Small caps don't exist at all any more and those three stocks you mentioned were officially the last to moon ever Any in particular you have your eye on? I think I’ve only traded in horrible years for pennies so to see all the moons last year when I was out was crazy 😭. 

A lot of times penny stocks hit the boom cycle at the same time and then sit for a while. It harder to find the good ones during those rough times than riding the boom wave… ![gif](giphy|cO00CdFOSa9X7EPYKB|downsized)

Yall should link up I’m probably not the best to listen to because most of my info comes from Reddit and a couple of YouTubers.

But, my favorite now is Sun hydrogen Hysr.  I’ve bought and sold a lot, making nice gains, but now I’m holding more as they gear toward commercialization.

To take the place of buying and selling I now play with healthcare triangle, hcti.  It has had some fun ups and downs in the past few weeks which has let me buy and sell.

Recently I put some into W & T offshore, wti, an old stock I had.  They don’t have the best reputation, but they are oil, and they do offshore stuff, which trump has talked about.  And best yet, they changed their website to the “Gulf of America” so they’re licking the right balls.  

Another big winner I have has been a marijuanna one, auxly cannabis group, cbwtf, which has given me gains of 93% for the past six months or so.  

Other than that I participate in a lot of the ones mentioned often here.

1lhgru4,2025-06-22,"Northisle Copper & Gold ($NTCPF)
A buddy of mine told me about this company back in the end of April 2025… we both got somewhat large positions when it was around 50-55¢ after doing quite a bit of DD on this company. It has since gone up quite a bit but I think there’s significantly more upside to this. 

Here’s a few highlights 

-junior mining company in Canada (Vancouver island)

-old PEA released some years ago says $2 billion after tax NPV (using old gold and copper prices of $2150 gold and $4.20 copper) 

-NPV based on updated gold prices comes in around $5 billion 

-the management team includes mining hall of famers joining up out of retirement, getting stock options and even buying $180,000 worth of stock EXTRA 

-6.9 million oz of gold 

-3.1 billion pounds of copper 

-infrastructure already in place from an old BHP mine from the 1990’s near by

-shipping port, streets and airstrip already in place 

-CEO looking for a partnership 

My simple request for anyone reading this is to do a little bit of research on these guys and if you like what you see get some. I don’t think we’re gunna be done with this gold bull run anytime soon. There is still some MAJOR upside to this company. There are vids with the CEO Sam Lee all over YouTube. He was just at Silicon Valley as well as one of 2 mining companies invited. 

The stock should be over $2 a share right now… 

Ps: I will be replying at any and all comments with any shred of negativity in 6 months when the share price has doubled with an I told you so 😘

Nice

1lh9nu2,2025-06-21,"TALK is the Last Legit Telehealth Sleeper Under $3 — Still Untouched, Still Undervalued, Still Loading…
While the market chases overpriced AI hype and overcrowded biotech trades, $TALK is quietly stacking contracts with payers, rolling out Medicare in multiple states, and locking in pharmacy fulfillment with Amazon.


💥 What He ( Douglas ) May See That Others Don’t

1.

B2B2C Payer Model Is Hugely Underappreciated


Most people still think Talkspace is a direct-to-consumer therapy app. That’s outdated.



In reality, payer revenue is now 50%+ of the business — and growing faster than DTC.



They are contracted with Cigna, Aetna, UnitedHealth, Optum, Oscar, and expanding Medicare.


Each state rollout unlocks thousands of recurring patients.


It’s not therapy per click anymore — it’s recurring, insured volume.


📌 If Talkspace becomes the default mental health layer in 30–50 states under Medicare + payors, that alone could push revenue from ~$150M today to $400M–$600M in 3 years, and you get valuation multiples on predictable, contracted healthcare income.



2.

Talkspace Is Being Positioned as “Mental Health Infrastructure”







Amazon is not just a pharmacy partner — it’s a distribution channel.



Talkspace could be a plug-in for Prime Health, Amazon Clinic, or Alexa Health.


If that integration deepens, it creates a massive moat. Think: virtual urgent care + therapy + fulfillment = Amazon-branded health stack.

Braunstein is a deal guy. If he thinks this leads to a takeover or joint venture, that $10+ makes a lot more sense.


3.

Insane Unit Economics at Scale


Once providers are onboarded and sessions are running, margins explode.



They’re holding $100M in cash and not burning through it — very rare in small cap healthcare.



If they scale without needing major new capital, then any revenue growth goes straight to bottom line.



A profitable, clean-balance sheet company with 30%–40% growth could easily trade at 10x EBITDA, putting it near $1.5B+ in valuation, or $8–$10/share.

4.

Mental Health Demand Is Still Underestimated







Post-pandemic mental health is not receding. It’s getting baked into the healthcare system long-term.



CMS has already made behavioral telehealth permanent past 2025 — Talkspace was early and is now ahead.



Government-backed reimbursement means the floor is rising, not just the ceiling.





🧠 Final Thought:





You’re not wrong to be skeptical — the growth isn’t obvious unless you’re following:







The payer model shift



The state-by-state Medicare expansion



The Amazon alignment



The financial discipline they’re finally showing

If you’re only looking at DTC therapy revenue or app downloads, you’ll miss the real story.



But Braunstein? He’s not betting on therapy as a consumer product. He’s betting on Talkspace becoming part of the healthcare payments infrastructure. That’s where the 5x–10x upside comes in.


Just bought some Have you asked yourself why Amazon didn’t choose teledoc instead of talkspace ? Exactly they don’t have the same moat Talkspace does with insurance and Medicare active states

1lh7ie4,2025-06-21,"📉 Total Newbie Alert: Diving Into Penny Stocks — Where Do I Even Start?! 🚀
Total Newbie Alert: Diving Into Penny Stocks — Where Do I Even Start?! 

Hey everyone,

I’m completely new to the world of penny stocks and feeling a bit overwhelmed. I’ve been listening to Timothy Sykes (yes, I know… mixed reviews) but I’m honestly more confused than inspired at this point. 

I’ve got a few burning questions and would really appreciate some advice from people who’ve been through the trenches:
1.	How do I actually get started? Like, what’s the first real step after “deciding to learn”?
2.	What platforms are beginner-friendly but still powerful enough to actually do something useful?
3.	Where do I find legit charts/graphs to track these stocks? Any tools or sites you swear by?
4.	Is it really worth following Timothy Sykes or are there better educators/resources out there?

I’ve read some pretty harsh reviews on his stuff and I don’t want to waste time (or money) chasing bad advice.

Would love to hear your honest experiences, recommendations, or even just lessons learned the hard way. I’m here to learn, make mistakes, and hopefully get better with some Reddit wisdom by my side. 

Thanks in advance!

1. Don't invest more than you're comfortable losing.  You'll find some winners, but will find more losers.

Edit :fixed autocorrect Be very skeptical of small cap biotech companies that lose money.  They are popular on this subreddit, because they are lottery tickets, but like lottery tickets they are a losing proposition in the long run.

I know it's popular to poo poo reddit, and this forum, but I've had decent luck browsing this subreddit and being very picky about what to invest in.  Seems like small caps that get posted here that have shown profits and decent increases in revenue YoY do really well; you don't find that combination alot, but they do happen.  Lots of volatility with small cap stocks; I typically put in limit orders for much lower than the current ask price, and wait a few days until the order fills if I find something I like.  You'll miss some runners that way, since your order will never fill, but you also don't get stuck in bad positions nearly as often.  Check the debt of anything posted in this forum, if a company is in too deep of debt, it's almost never worth playing.

The vast majority of what's posted here won't work out well, but there are definitely diamonds in the rough.  Also, just like general trading, don't get caught up in a chasing and avoid the overtrading mentality - you are going to miss out on alot of good plays, just the nature of the game; but if you get caught up in a FOMO or chasing mentality and compensate by overtrading you will lose alot of money, very, very quickly.  Best to be cautious and only bet your money on plays you really like; that's true for trading in general, but it's even more important when trading pennies.

Also take everything I've said with a grain of salt; I've only been actively trading for a year.  I have done well in that year though, so I feel like what I'm saying has some value.  What made me finally start turning a profit was adopting the mentality of only swinging at the best pitches though:  I found very quickly it's best to miss out on some runners then to continually lose money on risky action chasing. Never buy after the run-up on penny stocks. Thats just when the scammers are unloading their positions.

Also never buy penny stocks that have poor balance sheets. You’re asking to be killed with stock offerings and dilution.

Penny stocks can make a lot of money if you buy decent companies that are profitable or near-profitable. Market dislocations occur most frequently in small companies because hedge funds and institutions don’t buy that stuff.

Buy a basket of cheap, profitable, undervalued companies and you will beat the market every year. I’m pretty new too. There is still SO much I don’t know, but I’ve learned a few lessons as a newcomer.

1# ⚠️ Don’t invest more than you can lose! Everyone is right about this one. This is gambling, you will lose. Penny stocks aren’t going to fund your retirement or pay your rent. This is for fun, use your “entertainment” money and expect to lose. If you aren’t having fun losing, rethink investing in penny stocks.

You will hear some great advice here, but the FOMO is strong. It’s human nature to make mistakes, it takes practice to emotionally detach. Some lessons you will have to learn the hard way even if you have been warned. Be forgiving of yourself.

There are a LOT of scammers and bots on Reddit. The more a stock is mentioned, the more you should suspect it of being a meme stock. Or worse a pump-and-dump scam. If a stock is mentioned over and over the same day or the post contains emojis 🚀🚀avoid it like the plague. 

People are very quick to laugh at and call out losers/bagholders/fools when these stocks eventually go bust, but very few people speak up beforehand when they are getting hyped. 

DD means due diligence. It means you should research companies before you invest in them. You will be mocked for not doing this. If you are making a big play I agree, you should absolutely know as much as you can. I don’t make big plays. I personally think it is ridiculous to spend hours researching a company that sells for 40 cents a share. They are penny stocks for a reason. I don’t have that kind of free time, this is just a hobby I can spend 10-20 minutes a day on. I know I am gambling, it would cease being fun if I had to do that kind of research for a $40 play. My time is worth more than that. I might buy something just because someone here has recommended it and listed some reasons they think it will succeed. Some of these recommendations will be gems and some of them will… not. I’ve also had luck buying and selling meme stocks against conventional wisdom. If you get in fairly early, the hype lasts a while, and you sell before it tanks you can make some easy money. But at the bare minimum look at the stock history for the last year or two before buying anything recommended on Reddit. It only takes a minute and can help spot stocks that are frequent pump-and-dumps, have had only downward momentum, recent bad press, or are at their peak highs.

You have to sell to make money. This one is still hard for me. I lose the most by not selling when the selling is good. If I pick a winner I don’t want to sell it. I get emotionally attached. What if it really takes off and I end up being the idiot that sold Amazon for $10? I am trying to detach enough to sell at a set %. Penny stocks are not meant for long term holds. I am a work in progress. Already up 250% this year.  No thanks. I'd start either with 10$ trades or paper trading.  Charts are extremely misleading with penny stocks and many times will do the exact OPPOSITE of what you'd expect.  Penny stocks are damn near like meme coins - they are a huge gamble.

However, penny stocks that experience a surge in volume and continue - those are the ones to focus on.  You can find them on daily price jumps on Robinhood and you'll see at least 30 of them a day.  If the volume is less than 1m they rarely get my attention.

If you see a stock worth 1 dollar with an average trading volume of 100k a day and it randomly has 2m in volume those are my target. Jesus christ OP if you take any advice here please let this persons be the first. Don't use this sub. Do your own research because 95% of what gets posted here is absolute garbage. Garbage is putting it generously. Most of what's posted here is posted with the intention to have exit liquidity. P and D Don't do it. Buy good, profitable companies.

Billionaire investors of energy drink maker Celsius own almost 50% of the stock. Would bet they just buy out the other half of the company and take this private.

Disclosure: Long
How’d you find out about it? What's the full name of the stock? I can't find INBP on my brokerage. Integrated BioPharma Undervalued stocks can stay cheap, until they’re not. Sometimes it’s a catalyst…INBP just reported their best quarter in the last 3 years. The stock is thinly followed so it didn’t get much of a bounce. Sometimes cheap stocks just start creeping towards fair value if enough people start to realize it’s undervalued.

In the case of INBP, I think the Celsius investors will just end up buying out the other half of the company at some point. So it could possibly stay cheap, and then you wake up to a 200% buyout premium one day. Even if they don’t buy it out, I’m still owning a stock that I feel is dramatically undervalued based on its own fundamentals. But I don’t really see a scenario where the stock goes considerably lower from current levels, so I like the risk/reward.

Agree it looks under valued
Grok suggested it’s because of limited growth
Im kinda wondering the same thing, if it appears undervalued, what is going to change that any time soon? Where did you find the owners of Celsius own 50% ?? [removed] It’s in the SEC filings. Can be seen in the yearly DEF14A (annual shareholder meeting).

It’s the DeSantis family. Damon DeSantis is still on the Board of Celsius (and also INBP).

1lh38ou,2025-06-21,"Do yall know about any upcoming stock catalysts (Mergers, Acquisitions, Partnerships, FDA approvals etc) coming up this June or July? + TIRX upcoming potential
If you know of any upcoming mergers, partnerships, acquisitions or any other potential catalysts that are upcoming this June or July then please share them with us in the comments below. I would be interested in hearing how you found the stock as well.  
  
  
I found a stock called TIRX with it and I think it has a lot of potential. It's very cheap at 1.23, has a small float of 7.54 M and is closing a major 150 Million Dollar acquisition of Chinas only AI-Driven hospital and Risk Management platform. The stock surged to 2 dollars after the news was announced, and it will likely surge again after it closes the deal.  I'm very new to trading so I would like to know your opinion on the stock. The stocks volume is also very very low, at only 15,757 shares compared to the average 419,975 shares, meaning it can be prone to a sudden surge in price if volume increases. According to algorithmic trends, it is going to surge on June 27th-June 30th although I don't know how accurate those can be. TIRX has a lot of things going for it, Low Float, Small Price, Volume low currently meaning it can spike at any moment, and a major upcoming acquisition in June. 
UNCY has FDA decision for OLC on June 28th SSY has a merger due to close around the end of this month.

UNCY has a PDUFA date a week on Monday, and KALV should be receiving a response from the FDA anytime in the next three weeks, their PDUFA date wasn't met.



FDA schedules are pretty easy to find Talkspace rolling out more states

It's nice that you ask. But sadly no one knows. 

Yes...we still hope for a DM with insider information [Sites like this can help you find them](https://www.benzinga.com/calendars/m-a) I’ve got one for you: LTBR.  

Company is being listed on Russell 2000 June 30 and currently isn’t floating enough for index funds to make mandatory purchases.

I’m expecting a ~50% chance of an extreme squeeze and a likely 2x on day of listing.

But I’m a regard and this isn’t advice.

PSTV (Plus Therapeutics) – Undervalued low-float biotech now rated 'Buy' by Zacks

There might be an interesting setup forming around PSTV, a low-float biotech stock trading around $0.19–$0.20. It recently received increased attention after Zacks Investment Research upgraded it to a “Buy” rating (Rank #2), citing improved earnings outlook and institutional confidence.

Key points:

Zacks upgraded PSTV to Rank #2 – Buy, suggesting increasing confidence in the company’s fundamentals.

The average analyst price target is around $10, with estimates ranging from $4 to $20+. This is supported across multiple platforms including TipRanks, Fintel, MarketBeat, and StockAnalysis.

Low float characteristics combined with recent volume spikes (over 5.6 million shares on Friday) suggest early accumulation.

There has been no confirmed recent dilution, and the technical setup appears constructive with steady support levels.

Retail interest is still relatively quiet, which could make this an early entry opportunity before momentum builds.

Historically, PSTV has spiked above $1.00, and many retail holders from those levels may still be in, which could contribute to pressure if the stock begins to move again.


This isn't financial advice—just sharing a current observation to see if anyone else is watching this name.



I sold last Wednesday, is it still worth buying?

^(if) ^(you) ^(have) ^(any) ^(questions) ^(or) ^(concerns.) The setup still looks solid to me. Volume is increasing, no dilution has been confirmed, and with the Zacks upgrade and low float, it could move quickly if it breaks through resistance.

1lh2344,2025-06-21,"MDAI: $130M gov-backed AI device with 95%+ clinical accuracy and FDA Breakthrough status - submission expected this week, still at $54M valuation
MDAI: FDA submission expected this week. Current price $2.15. Base case $25/share. 95.3% accuracy. Government-backed. Institutions will follow

Ticker: MDAI
Current price: ~$2.15 (market cap $54m)
Base case target: $25/share ($1B valuation)
Catalyst: FDA submission expected this week

What is MDAI?

Spectral AI developed DeepView®, a non-invasive AI system that instantly assesses wound severity. In their latest multi-center clinical study, completed in May–June 2025, DeepView reached 95.3% accuracy in detecting surgical burn depth. Surgeons average just 40.8%.
It also improved detection of non-healing wounds from 61% to 89%. This is real, field-tested technology with applications in emergency rooms, burn centers, military triage, and diabetic care.

Leadership and track record:

Spectral AI was founded in 2013. The company is led by an elite team with deep expertise in medicine, finance, and IP strategy.
Dr. Michael DiMaio, Chairman, is a cardiothoracic surgeon with over 500 scientific publications.
Peter Carlson, CEO, previously led operations at MiMedx and other large healthcare firms.
Erich Spangenberg, Strategic Lead and IP head, has negotiated over $500 million in licensing deals.
This is not a hype-driven team. They are operators with a track record of execution.

Backed by the U.S. Government:

Spectral AI has received more than $130 million in non-dilutive funding from BARDA and the U.S. Department of Defense.
DeepView is already in live military trials and has been granted Breakthrough Device Designation by the FDA.
The FDA submission is expected this week. This is the regulatory milestone many institutional investors wait for.

Valuation context:
Other companies in medical imaging and diagnostics with lower accuracy and no government ties are already trading far higher.
Butterfly Network is valued around $900 million with standard ultrasound imaging.
Tempus AI, focused on genomic diagnostics, IPO’d at over $6.5 billion;
Guardant Health, focused on oncology, is valued around $4.7 billion;
None of these companies combine Spectral’s accuracy, government funding, and real-world deployment.

MDAI trades around $2.15 per share, with a market cap of just $54 million

Why institutions are watching:
Most healthcare funds avoid companies before an FDA submission is filed
Once the submission is confirmed, volume increases, analyst coverage starts, and institutional money flows in.
This is the de-risking moment that unlocks serious capital.

Valuation logic:
Assuming 40 million fully diluted shares, a $1 billion valuation equals $25 per share.
That’s a conservative base case if Spectral simply gets the FDA submission through and continues execution.
If they secure approval, roll out contracts with defense or hospitals, and gain media attention, long-term valuations above $50 are realistic.

Risks:
Submission could be delayed;
Execution post-FDA could face friction;
Dilution possible during future growth phases.

Final take

MDAI is one of the most undervalued medical AI plays in the market.
It has elite clinical data, government support, operational traction, and near-term regulatory catalysts.
At $2.15 per share, the risk is limited and the upside is asymmetric
$25 is the base case. The long-term potential is far greater

I’m long. Not financial advice. Just the numbers

Let me know wat you guys think!
They’ll immediately dilute afterwards to scale up. Will wait to see what the insiders do first and follow their lead. Last market buy was 5/24 and only $10k worth. Spectral AI Inc

1lh0uc5,2025-06-21,"Talkmarkets investigative news report on GALT and my apology
First the breaking investigate unbiased report on the Galt phase 3  trial results, the misinformation, the squeeze, what happened yesterday....All of it

Search for talkmarkets Galt

  
I recommend you read it, if you still find me liable upon proper due diligence you my message me on X to pursue legal action against me.

I also have issued a public apology to the press and on stocktwits it reads as follows:

  
Just don't know what to say,   
  
If you're in here and you're seeing this and you got shook out in that blatant market manipulation and you sold or your stop loss got triggered, you have nothing but my deepest sympathy.   
  
 It's unfair that short sellers can get away with misinformation to incite fear and panic.   
It's just one of the many tools that short sellers use to try and make sure that they always come out on top.  
And there is a lot of money potential in this stock I said it before it is scary money the potential amount is f\*\*\*\*\*\* scary 18 billion dollars is a lot of f\*\*\*\*\*\* money.  
  
So yeah they pulled some sheisty s\*\*\*,    
But at the end of the day nothing is approved.   
You had a stop loss for a reason. It's not the best idea in a short squeeze but who knows maybe we're wrong and it's going to end up saving you money down the road and we're going to go bankrupt over this.  
I honestly don't believe that's going to happen but this is a what if scenario.  
  
But from what I saw happen today my opinion, they f\*\*\*\*\*\* tricked you, that's what these rich bastards do. Misinform, induce panic, make money.  
  
 The data doesn't lie, people do.  
We gave you all the data.   
Everything we knew.  
Then, a couple of people showed you old data from a year and a half ago, a sliver of information from the current data that they purposely misrepresentated to sow doubt, and then at a pivotal moment, tactically attacked with 25k worth of shares to cause panic, while some yelled its a sell off.  They played f\*\*\*\*\*\* dirty.  
  
They stole our money, stole our stocks, all to get out from under the bed of fire that they made on shorting it into the dirt, and they're laughing about it right now I can almost guarantee it.  
  
Even though they're still idk 7 million shorted shares deep give or take, I won't have the current numbers until Monday.  
Anyways that's not the point.  
  
I wrote this because I had to do something....I wanted to show you that we are not them and how upset it made us that that happened.  
I realize these are just words so, maybe I can show you.  
  
When this is over, I'm donating half of whatever profits  I make to the the mighty oaks program with the explicit instruction the donation is to be used to expand the services offered at their new ranch in Walker county Georgia that provides assistance to veterans and their families that are suffering from PST or facing other hardships.  
  
I have no idea how much it's going to be in the end, but I will continue to buy this stock until this gets a buyout or it tanks.  
  
At this point it's about the principal and what's right.  
Cause f\*\*\* those guys.  
  
I won't be posting my account total balance or net worth, but once a day after AH close I will post screenshots of my profit or loss percentage on this stock and daily buy sell orders on this stock effective immediately.  
  
We can't undo what they did to you, we are also not the ones that did it, but I hope that when this is all over however it goes you see that we were never them.   
  
Things change, but how we feel about this stock and the company won't.  
People in here have been here 10 times longer than me 20 times longer than me. I'm just passionate. And that's my downfall.   
  
This was never a pump, never a dump,  
The drug works   
I am holding   
 I like the stock

**(OTCQB: AVAI)** is carving a niche in the burgeoning AI-driven healthcare sector through its joint venture with Ainnova Tech, Inc. The recent announcement of diabetic retinopathy screenings in Central America, starting June 17, 2025, in collaboration with Grupo Dökka’s Fischel and La Bomba Pharmacies, signals a strategic push into the healthcare AI market. This initiative leverages Ainnova’s Vision AI platform for early detection of diabetic retinopathy, a leading cause of vision loss in diabetic patients. The program’s expansion into Mexico and integration of pharmacies, retail, and ophthalmology services underscores a scalable, patient-centric model.From a market perspective,

**AVAI** is well-positioned in the growing AI healthcare market, **projected to reach $208 billion by 2030**, driven by demand for early disease detection and cost-effective diagnostics. The collaboration with established pharmacy chains enhances AVAI’s market penetration in Central America, a region with rising diabetes prevalence. Ainnova’s award-winning technology and partnerships with hospitals and medical device firms bolster credibility, potentially attracting further institutional interest.

I’m just curious if anyone has been checking out this company, they are still kind of in the early business days but seem to be making good strides in the last couple quarters.

- almost a positive EBITDA ( last 3 quarters have men getting them there) 
- operating expenses are pretty low ( a 20% increase y/y but they are growing so isn’t bad in my opinion 
-they have a good gross margin of 68% which is a pretty good % 
-so far they have increased sales pretty well in the last year and seem to work on expanding and commercializing 

I do think they have a shit tone of warrants ( like 75M ) which is a pretty hefty burden in my opinion, but the company’s management really seem to be sticking to the plan on lowering debt and getting sales and expansion on the way in 2025!

So I’d just like some opinions on this ? 
Good or bad?
