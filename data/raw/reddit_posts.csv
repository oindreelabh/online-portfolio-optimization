1myxys3,2025-08-24,"why NXP Semiconductors N.V. is part of the S&P500 and not ASML?
NXPI (stock ticker) similar to ASML are Euorpean (both Netherlands) based companies and are in semi-conductor space.

NXPI \~ USD Market Cap $59-$60 billion.

ASML \~ USD Market Cap $293 billion

Quick math with just market cap, shows that ASML is \~ 4x of NXPI

**Question - why is NXPI part of S&P500 (google search shows that it was included back in 2021) and not ASML?**

NXP Semiconductors NV is a holding company which engages in the provision of semiconductor solutions. It operates through the following geographical segments: China, Netherlands, United States, Singapore, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Other Countries. The company was founded on August 2, 2006, and is headquartered in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.

ASML Holding NV engages in the development, production, marketing, sales, upgrading and servicing of advanced semiconductor equipment systems. It includes lithography, metrology and inspection systems. The company was founded on April 1, 1984 and is headquartered in Veldhoven, the Netherlands.
ASML not incorporated in us Fun fact: both started as units of the company Philips Philips has an amazing track record of selling parts of their business that then blow up bigger than the original company Nxpi is neither, but it's primary listing is in the us. S&P 500 are not just the top 500 US based stocks but the requirement is the primary listing and liquidity in US. ASML seems to not meet that requirement since it's primary listing is in Euronext Amsterdam not Nasdaq for example. Same reason TSMC isn’t Because NXP is European but they decided to have their primary listing in the US (IPO), which is not generally how it happens for most EU companies. ASML is a dutch company with its primary listing in the EU, as one would expect. Fun fact Phillips used to own a 27,5% stake in TSMC as well.

1my86pq,2025-08-23,"Thoughts on why $MSFT has been weak since blowout earnings?
Gathering opinions on if I'm missing some narrative. Not the end of the world as it's had a strong run since the tariff, but it's odd. Down around 8% from the highs (up 20% YTD) on what was objectively stellar earnings and guidance from among the MAG 7 cohort. Price action has been very weak comparatively with a controlled sell off every day. Even $META who was another MAG 7 with fantastic earnings and guidance has been stronger.

Simply profit taking? AI destroying SaaS narrative?
I mean they are up 21% YTD. People getting too used to insane gains It’s trading at 37 times earnings. How much higher should the multiple be right now? It’s not like they’re guiding for 40 percent eps growth. And already at like $3.75T market cap, which makes it one of the most expensive entities to ever exist in the history of mankind. The earnings don’t support it. They have a 37x earnings multiple. Price to earnings growth ratio (PEG) is expensive at 2.3x. How much multiple expansion do you think is warranted? It’s already expensive based on earnings growth. Haven't they gained like 15% plus year over year? I mean... that's a VERY good gain in my books.

Edit: Almost 17% actually in €  (21% in USD) Look at CRWD, ORCL, other software names, all have similar charts. Sector rotation. Thats the answer… wallstreet and institutions dump stocks and and buy stocks in different sub sectors in rotation The economy is shifting. But, also, I think a lot of investors are buying into the ""tech has reached a peak/bubble"" rumors that keep flooding the place. If folks keep saying something about the market it starts to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. ""Tech is crashing! Tech is a bubble!"" every day.

I had a spread of tech stocks... AMD, NVDA, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG.. and even some lesser known stuff. Earnings have been good, but the stocks drop. Folks are taking earnings. But, the stocks kind of stay level. Could just be the summer/fall blues that hit the market. But, folks are reading into it that the tech ""fad"" is over.

In the long term.. like years, decades... tech is here to stay. We're exponentially increasing in tech every day now, and chips, algorithms, softwares, etc are driving everything now. So, tech stocks are not fads. They are the foundation to future techs.. like how ML/AI is being used to fast-track new drugs to production or find new uses for drugs. Or to analyze tons of data for things a human couldn't spot.

A dip in the economy will create a hiccup in all of that, though. And investors sometimes being irrational beings doesn't help, either. Not sure, but I just bought more shares. Keep buying!’ Is this AI in the room with you right now? Valuation is a poor way to gauge what? Value is what ultimately matters, regardless whether it’s a high growth or low growth stock. It’s all relative to future growth vs market expectations. If you expect Microsoft will have an eps cagr of 25% for the foreseeable future, then the current price is a steal. I just don’t think that’s realistic. 

15% over the next 10 years would be a great achievement, and at its current price, it’s fairly valued imo, maybe even slightly overvalued.

1mxzsrp,2025-08-23,"Thoughts on wulf? Google has 8 percent stake in it.
Just wondering about your guys thoughts on this.

Stocks is up from 77 percent in last 30 days. And is consolidating nicely around 8.50 to 9 zone for 1 week now. Also important to mention they have done convertible notes offering and have raised around 1.8 billion I believe it is in last 2 weeks from the offering

they are transitioning from bitcoin mining to more data centres company like IREN

All analyst have raised their PT on this.


Google has a 14% stake in them now since they ended up leasing another 160 megawatts plus the original 200. I have been to the sight, big things are going on there and they are meeting deadlines on time. They still have quite a bit of megawatts to lease out and just acquired Cayuga another sights on Seneca lake (similar footprint an old coal plant with electrical infrastructure to repurpose) they get most there power from the Niagara Falls power authority hydro. My only concern would be power in the future since ny has done away with any new gas plants and a nuclear plant they proposed at 1 gig watt is 15-20 years out if they started tomorrow. Wow Ryan Howard really did it huh? I was in at $7 and sold around $9.50. Bought back in again for high $8’s looking for another short term scalp. Trust me bro https://media0.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTZjMDliOTUyZzdjYXB6MHkxMWo3MXB6dGhqc256MWRkMnV1YnhsYTV4N3J3cW4xMiZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/rXSL6YwHJyRMYh9vhn/giphy.gif I've held this stock for years (yes through all the ups and downs and -80% periods) and this is a DREAM deal that every single other miner that is transitioning to HPCAI is trying to get. 


This stock was probably the third most hated miner after MARA and RIOT. But then WULF management actually delivered on their words and now they are seen as the leader.


They were one of the only miners, which were able to get a deal last year (with Coreweave) and now have gotten another with Google. This shows that other big companies actually trust the leadership of WULF, which is great for shareholders. 


Not financial advice but IMO right now is a good entry point because they've just finished any dilution needed to execute on their deals. Also their market cap currently is less than what the deals can give them. Personally I see huge upside even with the current jump in share price.


Warning that this stock is pretty volatile. It trades with Bitcoin and other miners as well and day traders love this stock for longing and also shorting. Just on Friday it rose +18% then ended up flat on the day. Another Bitcoin rally can also make this stock jump like crazy. Always people like you lol. Jokes aside though, what has made you go all in on Terawulf? Considering to buy some myself It was the condoms falling from the sky that made me want to invest :D Not OP, but what made me put money in is that their contact with Fluidstack/Google was for $3.7B with extensions up to $8.7B. Their marketcap was only ~$3B at the time. Google also committed to backstopping $1.8B of the deal and took a 8% stake in Terawulf. Less than a week later, they decided to expand the deal, with google essentially doubling their stake (~14%), doubling their backstop, and with a deal extension, it could potentially be a $16B deal. Terawulf's market cap is still only ~3.6B as of today. The deal extensions far exceed their market cap, so all they have to do is deliver. They also have a record of using CapEx efficiently, so there's a good chance they do deliver. The biggest headwind is probably tariffs, nobody really knows how that can impact construction. Appears that WULF is renting out excess AI compute to Fluidstack, who will provide the ""AI services"" layer on top.  This is similar to colocation model of a EQIX or DLR - they provide the hardware stack, the customer deploys their software solution on top.

I'd much rather invest in a full stack solution such as CRWV or NBIS.  In this case the company is working in unison, creating higher margin and capturing entire revenue and potential profit pool.  If split in two, sure the sides have incentive to work together, but also to squeeze as much from the other.",123,0.86,49,0,AloneStaff5051,stocks,['GOOGL'],thoughts wulf google 8 percent stake wondering guys thoughts stocks 77 percent last 30 days consolidating nicely around 850 9 zone 1 week also important mention done convertible notes offering raised around 18 billion believe last 2 weeks offering transitioning bitcoin mining data centres company like iren analyst raised pt google 14 stake since ended leasing another 160 megawatts plus original 200 sight big things going meeting deadlines time still quite bit megawatts lease acquired cayuga another sights seneca lake similar footprint old coal plant electrical infrastructure repurpose get power niagara falls power authority hydro concern would power future since ny done away new gas plants nuclear plant proposed 1 gig watt 1520 years started tomorrow wow ryan howard really huh 7 sold around 950 bought back high 8s looking another short term scalp trust bro ive held stock years yes ups downs 80 periods dream deal every single miner transitioning hpcai trying get stock probably third hated miner mara riot wulf management actually delivered words seen leader one miners able get deal last year coreweave gotten another google shows big companies actually trust leadership wulf great shareholders financial advice imo right good entry point theyve finished dilution needed execute deals also market cap currently less deals give personally see huge upside even current jump share price warning stock pretty volatile trades bitcoin miners well day traders love stock longing also shorting friday rose 18 ended flat day another bitcoin rally also make stock jump like crazy always people like lol jokes aside though made go terawulf considering buy condoms falling sky made want invest op made put money contact fluidstackgoogle 37b extensions 87b marketcap 3b time google also committed backstopping 18b deal took 8 stake terawulf less week later decided expand deal google essentially doubling stake 14 doubling backstop deal extension could potentially 16b deal terawulfs market cap still 36b today deal extensions far exceed market cap deliver also record using capex efficiently theres good chance deliver biggest headwind probably tariffs nobody really knows impact construction appears wulf renting excess ai compute fluidstack provide ai services layer top similar colocation model eqix dlr provide hardware stack customer deploys software solution top id much rather invest full stack solution crwv nbis case company working unison creating higher margin capturing entire revenue potential profit pool split two sure sides incentive work together also squeeze much

UK must be a utopia where they've solved every problem to consider paying for this. down, because of uncertainty I don't post much anymore and occasionally people from this sub DM me to ask so if anyone cares there are my current holdings across all my accounts, taxable and retirement:

- 10% cash
- 50% in VT (actually separate ETFs, but it's approximately VT). (roughly +27%)
- 10% AVUV (+24%)
- 10% AVDV (+44%)
- 6% redacted (+143%)
- 3% META (+340%)
- 2.7% GOOG (+57%)
- 1.7% SMH (+83%)
- 1.4% HCC (-5%)
- 1.2% AMZN (+14%)
- 1% XOM (+18%)
- Small holdings left in: CROX, BTU, VALE, VAL, V


According to Vanguard, my annualized rate of return since June 2021 is 15% (idk if this is good or bad or even trustworthy given my contribution schedule). Portfolio size crossed 200K a few months ago. Kinda crazy how quick going from 100K to 200K went, although I was investing heavily during that time.

I am not really active in investing much anymore. I'm still excited to see upside in HCC, VALE, VAL, albeit those are small holdings. I remain very bullish on Google and think the market is massively underestimating its leadership in AI and self-driving cars. I'm considering taking profits on META having more than quadrupled my initial investment. UK prime minister treating it more as a joke. What's that? Housing and groceries are unaffordable? Here's ChatGPT pro on us, mission accomplished.

Can you imagine adding 2 billion to your deficit for a hallucinating AI chat bot? What if Google comes out with a much better model, you gonna pay even more billions for that? > Those close to the discussion say Kyle never really took the idea seriously, not least because it could have cost as much as £2bn.

SV guy pumping his company suggests absolutely insane idea, minister smiles politely. Even if workers save a bit of time with AI, they'll just use it to relax. There's no incentive to ask for more work; therefore, the companies they work for won't see any significant benefits. AI is a bubble because it simply doesn't generate enough value in relation to the cost. If the new trend is countries purchasing AI subscriptions for their entire populations, that's probably bullish for AI: 

> The boss of the firm behind ChatGPT and the UK technology secretary discussed a multibillion-pound deal to give the entire country premium access to the AI tool, the Guardian has learned.

I see all these positive news for ORCL, that they're gonna work with White House, working with Google to deploy Gemini, got so & so new customers, gonna do well in cloud & big data domain so on. I don't see much discussion on ORCL here. I'm no expert at valuations and hence asking for opinion. Is this a good stock to hold to pump on the dip, for 5-6 years and maybe it could go $400+, or are all these good news just eyewash? I currently have avg cost basis of $250.

Jane Street and CoreWeave have a close relationship. The trading firm participated in several rounds of investments in the hyperscaler before it went public in March of this year. Prior to announcing its updated stake on Wednesday, Jane Street owned roughly 5 million shares of CoreWeave.  
  
Jane Street has also been a customer of CoreWeave’s since 2024, utilizing the company’s GPU infrastucture to grow its training and inference models. CRWV, NVDA, AMD, BGM, CRM, and META may benefit as demand for GPU infrastructure and AI-related services remains a core driver despite near-term volatility.
Millionth time already  people buy the hype and get wrecked Before IPO I read their SEC filing and was left unmoved.

It’s impressive that they have taken advantage of the hype and are currently benefiting by the giant demand for data centers (revenue was up 800%), however it’s not like this is something no other company can do (especially big tech). Their revenue is completely reliant on Microsoft (accounts for 60%+). Add 2 more big tech giants and that number jumps up to 90%. Then you look at all the costs they have for building out more capacity, and you find out how unprofitable they currently are and will be for at least 3-5 more years.

Their current strategy is to scale up as fast as possible, which isn’t bad in itself, however demand falters for a year and they’ll go under. The risk was way too high for me even at their IPO valuation. I’d be willing to reconsider at around a 5b valuation, and even that is paying a premium.

Now, this isn’t to say this can’t work, tbh if all goes well and there is no reason for demand to slow, Coreweave might just be the perfect acquisition target for Microsoft or any other giant that wants to increase their data center capacity. However, the real money was clearly made pre-ipo, and successfully so as they have carried the hype into the public markets.

Retail is the exit strategy buying into hype as far as I can see.

There is another route they can take other than getting acquired, if they merged with another company such as NBIS, things could get interesting as they start to show signs of a tangible competitive advantage, however they would still have to address the reliance on a few customers. No cash flow, huge debt - oh yeah - great investment. I think you are missing a few things. Most of Coreweave cost in building out data centers is already backed by contracts, so that revenue is already planned. They don’t need to keep scaling, they just need time to bring on their current data centers so they can start getting the revenue from the contracts.

Two as someone close in the space, Coreweave is still way better than any of the competitors. Their dominance in the space has a chance to keep growing leading to even faster growth. 

It reminds me of NVidia a few years ago, to a smaller scale. Every said they would have to scale insanely to justify their price at 1T and that was unlikely. But just like NVidia, Coreweaves growth is in already signed contracts, and there position in the industry is growing now shrinking.

Honestly it’s pretty likely this stock doubles in the next year or two 95% of my portfolio does this. Then I had 200% gain on oklo this year and I use these money now for more speculative trading, but no leverage just plain stocks so in case I can keep them for longer. Going well for me so far and oklo is still below the level I took profit. 

Maybe it's stupid or maybe it's a way to make even more extra profit. If I lose it all, it's just burning speculative profits at this point anyway. Time will tell. No cost?  You dont think Microsoft is making record revenue from Azure cloud services that focus on AI or from Copilot?  They also have a massive stake in OpenAI. Better do some better research When do you expect operational profitability, lowered debt, and positive net income/fcf? It’s hard to say. In theory if they stopped growing and just delivered all their current contracts they would become profitable very quickly, next year likely. 

But if demand is strong and they keep accelerating growth, then it could still be another year or two as revenue will always be 6-12month after initial cost of build out. 

Eventually they will be making enough money from their existing data centers that it makes up any current builds outs. But just the way things are going for them now, future demand is much higher than current usage so the cost end up being really high. I can’t imagine they will keep doubling revenue every year for the next couple years, so profitability would have to come in a year or two max. Interesting, will take it into account next time I revisit. Sold out it a few days ago and it's gapping down. ",7,0.63,24,0,Zestyclose-Salad-290,stocks,"['NVDA', 'META']",crwv early surge welcome albeit brief reprieve investors coreweaves stock tumbled since earnings report tech stocks general sold recent days coreweave hit especially hard stocks price 39 since earnings reported aug 12 close lost 505 since record close 18358 june 20 jane street coreweave close relationship trading firm participated several rounds investments hyperscaler went public march year prior announcing updated stake wednesday jane street owned roughly 5 million shares coreweave jane street also customer coreweaves since 2024 utilizing companys gpu infrastucture grow training inference models crwv nvda amd bgm crm meta may benefit demand gpu infrastructure airelated services remains core driver despite nearterm volatility millionth time already people buy hype get wrecked ipo read sec filing left unmoved impressive taken advantage hype currently benefiting giant demand data centers revenue 800 however like something company especially big tech revenue completely reliant microsoft accounts 60 add 2 big tech giants number jumps 90 look costs building capacity find unprofitable currently least 35 years current strategy scale fast possible isnt bad however demand falters year theyll go risk way high even ipo valuation id willing reconsider around 5b valuation even paying premium isnt say cant work tbh goes well reason demand slow coreweave might perfect acquisition target microsoft giant wants increase data center capacity however real money clearly made preipo successfully carried hype public markets retail exit strategy buying hype far see another route take getting acquired merged another company nbis things could get interesting start show signs tangible competitive advantage however would still address reliance customers cash flow huge debt oh yeah great investment think missing things coreweave cost building data centers already backed contracts revenue already planned dont need keep scaling need time bring current data centers start getting revenue contracts two someone close space coreweave still way better competitors dominance space chance keep growing leading even faster growth reminds nvidia years ago smaller scale every said would scale insanely justify price 1t unlikely like nvidia coreweaves growth already signed contracts position industry growing shrinking honestly pretty likely stock doubles next year two 95 portfolio 200 gain oklo year use money speculative trading leverage plain stocks case keep longer going well far oklo still level took profit maybe stupid maybe way make even extra profit lose burning speculative profits point anyway time tell cost dont think microsoft making record revenue azure cloud services focus ai copilot also massive stake openai better better research expect operational profitability lowered debt positive net incomefcf hard say theory stopped growing delivered current contracts would become profitable quickly next year likely demand strong keep accelerating growth could still another year two revenue always 612month initial cost build eventually making enough money existing data centers makes current builds outs way things going future demand much higher current usage cost end really high cant imagine keep doubling revenue every year next couple years profitability would come year two max interesting take account next time revisit sold days ago gapping

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Aug 21 (Reuters) - Nvidia [(NVDA.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/NVDA.O) has told some component suppliers to suspend production of its H20 AI chip, designed specifically for the Chinese market, the Information reported on Thursday, citing two people with direct knowledge of the communications.According to the report, Nvidia instructed Arizona-based Amkor Technology [(AMKR.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/AMKR.O) to stop production of the H20 chips this week and also notified South Korea's Samsung Electronics [(005930.KS)](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/005930.KS)

Amkor handles advanced packaging for the chip, while Samsung Electronics supplies high-bandwidth memory chips for the model.Neither companies immediately responded to a Reuters request for comment.Meanwhile, Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement, ""We constantly manage our supply chain to address market conditions.""""As both governments recognise, the H20 is not a military product or for government infrastructure.

1mwjnr5,2025-08-21,"Mag 7 AI deals are creating zombie startups: ‘You hollowed out the organization’
https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/19/how-ai-zombie-deals-work-meta-google.html

> Jeff Wang got a big promotion last month. There were lots of tears, but not the happy kind. The 39-year-old was unexpectedly named interim CEO of artificial intelligence coding startup Windsurf. The company had been in discussions with OpenAI about a potential acquisition that would have resulted in a handsome payday for many employees. But the talks fell apart and, on July 11, several founders and top researchers instead left to join Google as part of a $2.4 billion licensing deal.   As one of the highest-ranking executives remaining at Windsurf, Wang was elevated to the top job, at least for the time being. His first order of business, he told CNBC, was to break the news at a tense all-hands meeting at the startup’s Silicon Valley headquarters. “It was a very, very challenging day,” Wang said. “People were crying. It was very, very emotional. I was spending half the time calming down people, because they have families and they got nothing.”

> Windsurf is part of a growing crop of AI startups whose founders and top researchers have been poached by megacaps like Meta, Google, Microsoft and Amazon through high-priced talent grabs that are helping the biggest companies skirt regulatory scrutiny. While the deals often produce big payouts for founders and AI leaders, they can leave investors, other employees and the remaining company in limbo. Samir Kumar, a general partner at Touring Capital, said that what’s left is something resembling a zombie company. “There’s a big question of what their future prospects are,” Kumar said. “Frankly, you hollowed out the organization.”  The headline-grabbing deal came in June, when Meta rocked the tech industry by announcing a $14.3 billion investment in data labeling startup Scale AI. As part of the agreement, Meta took a 49% stake in the company, hired its CEO Alexandr Wang to lead a new superintelligence lab and said it would deepen the work it does with Scale. A month later, Scale cut 200 full-time employees, or 14% of its staff. Meta’s investment had doubled Scale’s valuation from $14 billion last year. But that number only exists on paper.

> Microsoft used a similar playbook in March 2024, when it hired Inflection AI’s co-founders and other staffers. Amazon has completed two such deals in the last year, nabbing the founders and top talent away from Adept in June 2024, and from Covariant two months later. Google inked a $2.7 billion licensing deal with Character.AI and hired its founders last August.

> For Silicon Valley venture investors, long the lifeblood of risky tech startups, the system isn’t functioning as intended. Companies that would otherwise be on the path to a potential initial public offering or lucrative acquisition are getting pulled apart, with the bulk of the cash ending up in the pockets of the founders and their leading engineers. “The money doesn’t flow as straightforwardly as it would in just a pure M&A transaction,” said Rob Toews, partner at Radical Ventures.

God, I'm so torn on this. Often founders but _especially_ first engineer employees get screwed by VC funds. They say, we'll give you equity, and you think it could be worth millions, then they dilute you until it's worth $10k. The VCs walk away with all the cash. So I'm happy the tables have turned.

On the other hand, 5 large corporations buying up planet earth is real bad, real real bad. Most of the people that get screwed are the regular employees whose equity is now worth almost nothing That explains why there havent been many AI IPOs this year. Mag 7 have been buying out their CEOs and top engineers. No.  They just failed

This is a peculiar case where they’re successful and getting acquired. 

Just, to avoid DOJ scrutiny, FAANGs are acquiring the top ppl for the money, not the actual company. Under the guise that they have the know how to recreate the secret sauce ofc Isn’t this the result of the hostile M&A environment for tech companies? Acquihires are basically dead now. >the system isn’t functioning as intended. Companies that would otherwise be on the path to a potential initial public offering or lucrative acquisition are getting pulled apart, with the bulk of the cash ending up in the pockets of the founders and their leading engineers

This is a twisted narrative.  The reality is all these AI startups do not have any monetiziation plan whatsoever.  It's just a bunch of experts in ML and DL banding together hoping for a big payday.  But current infrastructure does not support wide usage of AI yet.  If that's the case, how can you even create and try to market and sell an AI based product/service?  It would basically be "".com"" era all over again - all we have is ""AI"" in our name.

Most of these AI companies don't have any worth outside of their talent.  The talent fetching big paydays is fair - they have an in demand and scarce talent.  The capital markets are just trying to pass pre-revenue/pre-product/no monetization business to the next person - that's the actual scam. Yea founders and early members cash out in IPOs, OP watched The Social Network once and thinks Eduardo Saverin's situation is the norm. Takes two to tango.

1mwhd5g,2025-08-21,"GPT5 was the AI canary in the coal mine - we are rounding the top of the diminishing return curve
OpenAI is one of the leaders in the AI space right now with the top two or three models currently available for the last 5-6 years. GPT 5 was just released and though it typically scores on the top of benchmarks, [this is only for the top model. This is also after working on development for nearly 2 years.](https://artificialanalysis.ai/articles/gpt-5-benchmarks-and-analysis)

In some recent interviews, not only did Sam Altman state that AI was a bubble, [he also stated that their company needs to potentially spend 1T$ to keep up with the demand for ChatGPT.](https://fortune.com/2025/08/19/sam-altmans-open-ai-paradox-warning-of-ai-bubble-while-raising-trillions/) This is deeply concerning for a product that is not profitable and isn't exactly in its infancy anymore. Altman has also stated that they are struggling to keep up with demand for GPT 5 as it stands and at the limits of what their data centers are capable of providing. The demand might be there but the money doesn't seem to be.

Ballooning costs for marginal gains is not unique to OpenAI - [Gemini is projected to have cost Google nearly 200M$ to train, other models with similar costs.](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/training-costs-of-ai-models-over-time/) It is already predicted that [AI will run out of training data sometime in 2026](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/artificial-intelligence-future), at which point it will likely need to start generating data to train itself on. This could lead to more hallucination and less nuanced data, potentially even leading to misalignment as described by the paper [AI 2027.](https://ai-2027.com/) A paper which most engineers now consent is more likely to happen in the 2040s rather than in 2027 like previously predicted.

All this is to say - I think Sam Altman is right, AI is a bubble. This is deeply concerning as AI companies alone are almost [30% of the entire SP500](https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500) by market cap now. A recent MIT study [found that 95% of corporate spending on generative AI is yielding little to no measurable returns so far.](https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/) Are these companies just going to spend endlessly? Where is the limit to this? When and by how much will AI really be profitable? Is AGI even possible with our current technology? When does the bubble burst?

All this to say - diversify your holdings now folks, I think the train is going to derail at some point in the near future hear, not sure when.
Did anyone honestly think that the planned $3 trillion in AI infrastructure that allegedly would be built out over the next few years could possibly end up with a meaningful return on cost? Public-facing LLM's, like ChatGPT or Gemini or whatever, are a part of the AI landscape, but they are not *the* AI landscape. Dont you people get it?

Eventually there will be no more free usage. 
They get the people used to having a good AI, then they leverage this for profits, either by subscription or ads if they keep limited free usage. This solves their computing demand and lack of money. Exactly. I work in logistics and there's so many things this can help with Reminds be during the internet bubble when everyone was tripping over themselves to lay down fiber and Cisco was that era’s  NVidia. History sure does rhyme. Lol, go to the gpt subreddit. The majority of chat gpt “super users” are using it for fanfic, roleplay, dating it or other wierd shit. 

The posts on there are wierd as fuck man.

I don’t see LLMs being used for much more than advanced searching and generative text/code. Imagine thinking LLMs are the endgame for AI AI is too useful to go anywhere. I don't think it will crash, companies will just need to focus on improving profitability of their products:

- LLMs implementing ads for free users

- Raising prices for paid users.

- reducing inference costs via more efficient custom designed hardware

- Reducing training costs through newer more efficient methods

As it stands now, everyone is focused on winning market share and operating at a loss. Once the leader in the space(OpenAI) takes steps to achieve profitability, the competition will follow.

LLMs can absolutely be operated profitably, the only reason they aren't is because competition is so fierce that attempting to profit means losing market share or falling behind.

Most of the benefit of AI will go to non-tech companies using AI for improving their operational efficiency, benefitting from intense investment and competition from AI providers. The losers will be companies like Google and Meta that are needing to make expensive investments to stay relevant. That fiber eventually proved pretty essential tho The infrastructure will absolutely provide meaningful returns but in the long term, not sure about short term.

1mwgdgc,2025-08-21,"FTC Chair warns tech firms not to weaken data privacy to comply with EU, UK laws
FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson warned companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta that **complying with EU and UK digital laws** could **violate U.S. law** if it weakens privacy protections for American users. European regulations aim to control harmful content, but may require measures like **backdoors in encrypted systems**, which U.S. authorities oppose. The Trump administration is pressuring companies not to adopt **global policies** that reduce data protection in the U.S.

The issue here is the people that are pushing those laws in the UK are Americans.. American Christians spending millions to push religious conservatism in the UK https://share.google/OMhm0n7DaOJELidtW


The Secret of organization called The Family,
Council for National Policy,
Edmund Burke Foundation,
Alliance Defending Freedom,
And that's just a few that doesn't even name all the single individuals who are also contributing to this in correlation with the rest of them.

The investigation by openDemocracy found that more than two dozen organizations have been involved in legal battles across Europe pushing right-wing christian ideologies.

It's a battle on all fronts. If they can't get a law passed here, they go to Europe.

https://time.com/5903931/christian-right-conservative-agenda-europe-report/ GDPR is stricter, but the UK wanted Apple to basically create a backdoor to access your data. Only pressure from the US got them to back off. Good.  There's a whole lot of tech illiterate morons who have been pushing to weaken encryption over the years, it's not just one group. There's even some branches of the US government that have been trying to weaken encryption for years and force others to put backdoors in encryption.

The FBI for example literally tried to exploit a terrorism attack to bully Apple into putting backdoors into the iPhone's encryption. It was the case where they needed to unlock a terrorist's iPhone. They could have asked for the court case to kept secret, but chose not to because they incorrectly assumed that Apple would face so much backlash from the public for not ""helping them catch a terrorist"" that they'd cave, but instead tons of people came out in favor of Apple, and it helped Apple sell more iPhones for being willing to fight against the US government to protect their user's privacy and data. As a European, thank you. This shows how insane some of the new laws are. Even the US does it better. This is surreal. Like who? First paragraph is entirely true but it doesn't support your conclusion. They 100% are. Christians in America used to lock people up for sex acts they would commit in their own homes such as fellatio. Some of those laws weren't taken off the books until the 2000s. They want to know every single thing you're doing so they can control you. Also police in America which are supported by Christian nationalists routinely steal from the public during search warrants and traffic stops, which is called civil forfeiture and it's basically robbery.

1mwg1f8,2025-08-21,"Trump’s Slashes to Renewables Will Send  $CVX, $OXY, and $BE to the Moon
Yesterday, Trump announced that the US will not approve solar or wind power projects moving forward. This in and of itself may sound as bullish news for the oil, gas, and coal industries as money rotates into these sectors from renewables, but my bull case for stocks in the power industry has more to do with the direction of AI advancement and the role of power production in that.

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2025/08/20/trump-says-us-will-not-approve-solar-or-wind-power-projects.html

AI technology is really comprised of three segments: chips, data centers, and power. As of today, the chip companies have surged in share price (though they’re starting to take a hit), data centers are being developed expeditiously and backed by heavy investment, and, on the power side, we’re checks notes blocking the growth of a major sector of the power generation industry? There’s a weak link in this group. The forward-looking market potentially pricing in this worsening barrier to AI growth could be the first step towards an “AI Bubble” popping. Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, and Google make up over 25% of the S&P 500, and they’re at risk of taking a hit if something isn’t quickly done by the Federal Government to address a known upcoming bottleneck for AI advancement: Energy production. Sam Altman of OpenAI reportedly wants to spend “trillions” on data center development, and these data centers all need to be powered somehow (I’ll touch on this a little later). To sustain the US’ technological advancement, our energy production must expand to meet the needs of the data centers, and the Trump administration just slashed the fastest growing sector of the power industry. If we stop expanding renewable energy, non-renewable energy must grow, and I think the federal government will be motivated by the race with China and the pressure of a stock market downturn to give some support to the big oil, gas, and coal players.

Info on the AI-energy bottleneck: https://qz.com/ai-data-center-boom-us-power-grid-struggles

US is behind China on energy production for data centers: https://fortune.com/2025/08/14/data-centers-china-grid-us-infrastructure/

Chevron and Occidental are two US based oil and gas companies I’ve got my eye on. They’re both backed by Berkshire Hathaway (notably, more $CVX was acquired in Q2 by Berkshire), they’re positioned to later transition into renewables if the political landscape proves it to be more advantageous in the future, and, most importantly, they are poised to moon.

$MP was the big position I took in April, and this current situation gives me very similar vibes. Here’s the analogy: China is far ahead of the US in certain crucial resources (rare earth metals and energy production) necessary for technological advancement, then political policy placed constraints on the supply. The US’ access to energy is not being immediately slashed like it was with the China rare earth metals ban, however, we are approaching an AI-energy bottleneck and high interest rates + cuts to funding for renewable energy + Trump’s new stance on just not approving renewable energy projects is choking a significant and expanding sector of an industry that the country NEEDS to expand. We also know Trump does not want to be reliant on other countries for resources crucial to the US’ technological advancement.

At minimum, I see more news coverage (as a result of Trump’s latest statements) on the energy industry’s role as one of the Big 3 in the AI space, therefore pushing the stock price up. My more optimistic prediction is that new policies will be announced in which the federal government gives greater support to the oil, gas, and coal industries in a similar way to what happened with $MP.

Now, here’s the sleeper play. In doing my research on data center development, which as a reminder, Sam Altman intends to invest “trillions” into, I came across something of interest. Oracle has partnered with OpenAI and is in rapid development of data centers for OpenAI. The demand for these data centers is so large that developers like Oracle are planning to build them and get them off the ground far before they’re able to connect these data centers to the power grid. How will the data centers be powered without connection to the power grid? Gas generators made by Bloom Energy ($BE). It’s a bit more of a speculative play, but this company is focused on gas generators for data centers, they’ve got contracts, and the demand is very quickly surging.

Hi, I'm a global commodity! Do you know how I work? How can you write so many words and not mention the oil market outlook even once. You can't just say AI 10 times and expect it will go up.

Good luck lol. Just buy renewables. Cheap af rn Thanks for taking the time to actually think and actually write a post It‘s especially weird because oil isn‘t really used for electricity generation in developed countries and the companies mentioned are much more oil than gas weighted :/ Appreciate it. You’d think I’m pushing some crapper penny stock based on the response. This is big oil we’re talking about (lol), and, specifically, stocks that are being acquired by the pinnacle of value investing, Berkshire Hathaway. You’re not gonna get rich overnight on Chevron stock, but I think it’s a good buy with serious potential of having upcoming positive catalysts. 

I mean $BE is a bit of a YOLO, but I think I’ve made it clear that this is a high risk company that could definitely trend down unless additional positive catalysts occur. No guarantees there. >I’m not an expert on the energy industry. I trade on catalysts, and sometimes you have to move faster on catalysts than it takes to become an industry expert.

If you don't understand an industry you won't be able to understand whether there's actually a catalyst.

For oil companies to profit this AI demand has to translate into rising oil and gas prices. Will it?

Current oil market outlook is not looking very hot, with supply outpacing demand and OPEC cuts unwinding. We could see prices in the $50s.

Beside that as u/notreallydeep mentioned oil generally isn't used to generate electricity. Natural gas is. But due to the heavy drilling natural gas is plentiful in the US. This makes it very cheap and only a small part of revenue for most companies. Now with LNG export and data centers gas is starting to look more interesting, but if there's lots of drilling natural gas will probably stay somewhat cheap.

It's true that the companies you mentioned aren't very expensive. Long-term you might be okay. Maybe. I'd rather wait though. Thanks for this! Interesting play for sure. Midterms are coming. Buy ENPH. If you check the charts, these stocks look primed for a huge breakout (unfortunately not clear yet which way).

Is this market finally starting coming to grips with the reality of stagflation yet?

The normal tools for bailing out a weakening economy (rate cuts, QE, massive deficit spending) aren't in play because inflation is already well over the 2% target *and rising*. 

The Fed's hands are tied, there's little they can do to stimulate the economy without also spiking inflation. And consumers are already pissed about inflation as is, are they really gonna stomach 4-6% annual inflation over the next few years? Doubt it.

So we're gonna be trapped in a situation where the economy is shit and inflation is high indefinitely. Gee, it's almost like starting ""easy to win"" trade wars with the whole world at the same time all while deporting key parts of the work force in a tight labor market and blowing up the debt/deficit with tax cuts was a stupid idea or something...

Edit: of course the market V'd for no reason right as I posted this lmao So yeah. Again. As I've been saying; there probably will not be a rate cut in September.

And I'm going to extend that: if there is no rate cut in September, there will be no rate cut until Powell steps down or gets fired. Once Trump gets a lackey in there (Waller or Bowman), then a rate cut is in short order, and so is certain economic disaster. Nothing about this is ""fun."" It's highly disturbing how many people have normalized the insanity happening every day. 

Trust me, I'd love to go back to having a stable, competent leader but that isnt the world we live in right now. chances of no rate cut soaring. One can only imagine the pedo grifters crazy tantrum after realizing his investments will dump with no rate cuts. We were *this* close to an honest to god softlanding. 

If Trump did nothing but golf and grift quietly the situation would be much, much better off than it is Interesting dilemma for the Feds. The job market continues to weaken as corpo struggles with tariffs and have to either layoff or pass the prices down, the overall economic activity still remains hot and the consumer is taking on more debt rather than cutting back on spending. The consumer who didn't even know what a Tariff was before liberation day is now having higher inflation expectations and is pretty pessimistic overall. Sticky inflation numbers, especially on the core that cannot be ignored especially considering Trump's inflationary policy. Home prices requiring more than simple Fed tools to fix while sellers will remain as stubborn as ever. Pedo grifter looking to politicize future fed data and apply constant pressure to the feds. Bond market risking further deterioration and risk severely affecting institutions unrealized losses, the interest on our debt, and our credit rating. It’s hilarious how grifts and memestocks and crypto thieves and everything which damages the full faith and credit of the USA is pumping. Yep. You can't not discuss this regime when they are in the news daily and trying to control every aspect of our lives. If not for these tariffs, we'd already have seen at least one rate cut. Inflation was trending down when Trump took office and now we're moving back towards 3%. Some say we may get as high as 4-5%.

1mvy5mj,2025-08-21,"Why The Market will crash to historical level by December

Valuations: Valuations at historical highs are inflated by return expectations on major SPY components, based on their supposed resilience due to dominant market positions and anticipated AI-driven efficiency gains. In reality, this is largely speculative. We are at the onset of a shifting economy, and today’s bets resemble venture capital at the start of the dot-com bubble; all the eggs are in the same basket…the bubble, for a future demand that is difficult to explain and quantify in a new ecosystem that is being invented!

US debt: U.S. federal debt will continue to grow. Meanwhile, Japan faces a demographic crisis. While they haven’t taken drastic steps yet, indicators suggest Japan is actively seeking alternatives to rebuild its economy, which would likely involve a significant decoupling from U.S. debt. Will happen before december

Geopolitics: Russia is not withdrawing from Ukraine, and the West is deluding itself by expecting otherwise. Israel is preparing for a large-scale offensive in Gaza that will destabilize the region further ( imminent) . Any incident that can be framed as a justification for striking Iran will likely be used ( by November) The Trump administration is preparing measures for Venezuela ( By October) This sequence of events could push more Western countries to react: Canada may enter “full military cooperation with Europe,” while Mexico, Brazil, and other Latin American nations (excluding the “special case” Argentina) will probably announce expanded defense partnerships and arms purchases with Europe. ( By december)

Interest rate priced in: Rate cuts of up to 50 basis points are expected by year-end, but these are likely already priced in. As a result, any cut could trigger additional sell-offs.

Seasonal trading: As year-end approaches, expect seasonal dynamics: portfolio rebalancing, tax-loss harvesting, and positioning for 2026.

The Ballet Dancers: Tesla’s stock has been volatile, but Q3 earnings will provide clarity. A sell-off is likely, influenced by broader market beta. Palantir, meanwhile, looks poised to fall back below $75. ( by october)

Banks Balance sheet: More loan losses provision coming 


Those alternatives currency when main fiat goes berzeck? you eyes to cry, that was just some bluff! 

Domestic: The U.S. government’s consolidation of control in Washington, D.C. is only the beginning. Cities like Chicago and Philadelphia may follow under similar pretexts. Expect rising unrest.(By december)

My cents, I stand by it, could be wrong in the short term, but we are closer than ever
Short it then. Market drops 1% (this time over the course of 3 days) and this shit starts getting posted like clockwork. 🥱😂 Go for a walk outside. Found the guy who sold in April 😂 Short the stock market

All loud mouth Somebody pop the timing the market bubble Post number 7382288373 about high valuations and a 100% crash. Very innovative! Funny how people panic at every fluctuation. Like zoom out on the goddamn graph a little.

1mvxost,2025-08-21,"Meta freezes AI hiring after spending spree
As per WSJ 
https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-ai-hiring-freeze-fda6b3c4

With the sell offs the past two days, I wonder how this news will affect the markets, if anything. 

Also considering the chatgpt-5 issues, Sam Altman comments regarding AI, and with the feds speaking on Friday. I wonder how the market would be the next few days. 
Didn't these guys hire like 8-10 people across the globe who are supposed to be the top talent in the field at an average price of $100m/head? Guess that money has to come from somewhere! This could totally be an episode of Silicon Valley.

Zuck: ""We'll pay you $100 million to run our AI team!""

Richard: ""ok. great!""

(shows up first day of work)

Richard (looking around): ""Where is everyone?""

1mvpgqv,2025-08-20,"Tech stock selloff from misinterpretation of Sam Altman's AI Bubble comments
*Ignore any downvotes. This post is for long-term investors that want to profit from the AI era:*



We are in another DeepSeek like Tech stock selloff (remember Feb'25) because of misinterpretation of Sam Altman's AI bubble comments:

**SOURCE (from Sam Altman's interview with The Verge):**

[https://www.theverge.com/command-line-newsletter/759897/sam-altman-chatgpt-openai-social-media-google-chrome-interview](https://www.theverge.com/command-line-newsletter/759897/sam-altman-chatgpt-openai-social-media-google-chrome-interview)

>ChatGPT has roughly quadrupled its user base in a year and is now reaching over 700 million people each week. “Pretty soon, billions of people a day will be talking to ChatGPT,” Altman said. “We’re the fifth biggest website in the world right now. I think we’re on the clear path to the third.”

>For its operation to keep scaling, OpenAI needs a lot more GPUs. This is one of Altman’s top priorities. **“You should expect OpenAI to spend trillions of dollars on data center construction in the not very distant future,”** he confidently told the room.

>“We have to make these horrible trade-offs right now,” he said. “**We have better models, and we just can’t offer them because we don’t have the capacity.** We have other kinds of new products and services we’d love to offer.”

>He also thinks we’re in an AI bubble. “When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,” he explained. “If you look at most of the bubbles in history, like the tech bubble, there was a real thing. Tech was really important. The internet was a really big deal. People got overexcited. **Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes. Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.”**

**MY TAKE:**

* People saw the mention of Tech Bubble and started selling off Tech stocks!!
* In reality, he is just saying that there are a bunch of AI Tech startups (**software**) that are getting a tons of venture funding and many will fail
* But OpenAI and other leading LLM providers will still need trillions of dollars of GPU's
* OpenAI (and others) already have better models and products/services today but can't offer them to people because they don't have the GPU/Data Center capacity *(AI context size limitation/memory is a major constraint)*

When you understand this, you will invest appropriately and make fortunes from the AI investments while weak hands sell off

  
**DISCLAIMER**: Written by hand, no AI was used in writing of this post  

CEO of private company says public companies are in an AI bubble? 🤔 Must be nice being able to damage your competitors while your stock is private, mmm market share Isn't the (minor) correction because of the MIT study, not because of whatever Altman is yapping on about? That's why Palantir is the most affected while Nvidia is barely down. It wasn't these comments, it was the MIT study that says 95% of AI investments fail Wasn't Altman giving unrealistic expectations to GPT5/hyping it up? It clearly did not meet those so his ""we have better models"" comment is seemingly another carrot. He most certainly was. The dotcom bubble annihilated these small time internet companies and websites, not the giants. A bubble culls weak businesses. It will have no impact on the giants who lead R&D. He was probably talking about many smaller (3-4 employee) company AI software startups, such as the ones started by former OpenAI employees, getting multimillion dollar investments from venture funds Tech is selling off because sentiment is wavering—fundamentals DO NOT drive the market right now. We completely shrugged off a horrid PPI last week, its dumping now because some people are taking profits before Powell talks on Friday. 

The only way an actual correction happens is if “dip-buyers” get trapped by some indisputable piece of bad news. Today showed that 1. the market is shaky right now, and 2. sentiment is still strong enough to shrug it off. People need to read the actual article. Thats not what it said. The stock market is not reacting to Sam Altman's comments. It's reacting to ChatGPT 5 being basically a very expensive reduction in quality and the reality that Fed has no good reason to cut in September.

1mvdwlw,2025-08-20,"Think I’m gonna sell half of my SOXX for some BATT
Brand new to this, have been lurking here and keeping up with yahoo finance, chatgpt, friends who know more than me, etc. I have very very little in anything rn, just hoping to contribute $5k each year (insert laugh track), really just trying to learn and hoping for my money to grow.

Portfolio is roughly:
60% FXAIX
25% SOXX
5% ASML
5% GOOGL
3% AAPL
2% NVD (soxx tilt🤪)

I’ve been DACing since july and will continue to do so. If i can contribute more than $5k/yr I will but I’m a phd student so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. I did some research on heavy hype waves and compared today’s AI with video game boom, PCs, dot com, smartphones, etc. I’m not ""bearish"" on AI I just think it might make sense to diversify a bit. And I’m more interested in the next 5-10-15 years (in that order) than anything beyond. It looks like a good time to buy BATT to, just from its max curve. What do you think? Roast me!!!!!!

SOXX is great exposure to semiconductors, but having 25% there is already a pretty big concentration. BATT can add some diversification, but keep in mind it also comes with its own risks  lots of those companies are very cyclical and sensitive to regulation.

If your horizon is really 5–15 years, it might make more sense to focus first on balancing sectors rather than just swapping one niche ETF for another.

1muti80,2025-08-19,"Opportunity to Invest in Anthropic
Have an opportunity to invest in Anthropic at 170b valuation (through a SPV). This seems insanely high since it’s almost 3x their most recent valuation just a couple months ago.  6% fee, 20% carry.

With competitors like OpenAI, Google, Meta, xAI, would you make this investment? A part of me feels like it could be a 1T+ dollar company. I absolutely love Claude and use it religiously. Another part of me feels like 170b is already overvalued.
The fact they’re jumping on these SPVs to vacuum up capital from the general population tells you everything you need to know. Financial advisor here. This is a typical retail deal - not the first I’ve seen and not the last. 2 and 20 is standard for retail (obviously nobody predicts the future but Anthropic’s exit is expected in 3-6 years so the 6% translates to 1-2% annual). Not one we’d recommend to clients; if someone has enough wealth and really wants to go after Anthropic (or AI), there are better deals out there. 

And let me break down the number further: let’s say Anthropic exits in 6 years with $1T valuation. Your gross gain is about 455% (because of the 6% fee your cost basis is $180B). After 20% carry, you are left with 364% gain. Not too bad - but unless you get an in-kind distribution, that 364% is immediately subject to 20% LTCG. Maybe 23.8% if your income is high enough. You are now left with 290% gain. Now do your own math and take out your state taxes, unless you live in a state with no income taxes. 

Overall not a bad deal, IF Anthropic goes to $1T. Can it? To be conservative and let’s say it only goes to $600B. You ultimate gain before state taxes is about 150%. Still great, but did you really go through all this hassle (sub docs, K-1 tax reporting) for 150%. 

I’m pretty sure plenty of people will pay the fee and accept the risks here. If Anthropic were public today, I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s valued at $170B if not higher. But unless you are familiar with how venture works, my suggestion would be to avoid this. it's gonna take a hell of a long time for this ai bubble to pop, isn't it 5 months ago there was a post at 61B valuation. Seems reasonable, it'll probably IPO for 1 trillion next year. 


/s but probably reality Get in before the ipo, sell early after it spikes 50% For a point of reference OpenAI is currently doing a secondary sale at a $500b valuation. I’m not saying Anthropic is cheap or expensive. Absolutely fucking not. Great perspective!

1murrk1,2025-08-19,"AMC Q2 results: revenue up 36%, Wedbush issues first Buy rating since 2020
AMC’s Q2 2025 earnings came in stronger than expected and show signs of a real turnaround.

* Revenue climbed 36% year-over-year to **$1.4B** (AMC Entertainment Holdings)
* Adjusted EBITDA hit **$189M**, nearly 4× last year
* Free cash flow swung positive to **$88.9M**
* Attendance grew 26% to **62.8M guests**
* Record per-guest spending of **$22.26** (tickets + concessions)
* Premium formats like IMAX and Dolby filled theaters almost 3× faster than standard auditoriums
* Debt progress: added **$244M cash** and pushed out 2026 maturities

The big catalyst is that Wedbush just upgraded AMC to “Outperform” with a **$4 price target**, its first Buy rating on AMC since 2020 (Barron’s / MarketWatch).

AMC’s management also said they believe current cash and operations are enough to cover the next 12 months.

**Discussion:**  
Is this finally AMC shifting from meme stock to legitimate turnaround play?
Revenue up 36%. Still posts a net loss is one of the strongest quarters for movies ever.

You buy this shit and you deserve to lose money. Buy CNK or IMAX instead. Anyone with half a brain cell should avoid this stock like the plague >but AMC has the bigger upside if the turnaround keeps building

What turnaround? They will lose 300M+ this year. Dilution will follow. AMC is pivoting into a new business: selling bags to its fodder....I mean shareholders! They still around? Seems like bankruptcy is overdue for this business Movies aren't dying. Movie theaters are. There's a difference.  

I wonder how AMC will continue to compete against its rival theaters as well as every streaming service that is developing its own content and movies now 🤔 Lol okay bud. Investing in AMC now is like investing in newspaper companies in 2008. >They are still posting losses but the shift is in the trend. Revenue, attendance, and cash flow are all moving in the right direction.

One quarter isn’t a trend.

>I really came here to see peoples mentality on AMC. This thread helped me see it.

How about you be a little more transparent? How many shares of AMC do you have and what’s the cost basis? Hasn’t made a comment in 3 years… starts hyping AMC. You hiding something? Fewer people are spending more money than ever before.

1muo6ix,2025-08-19,"Meta is planning to downsize its AI division overall, in latest shake up
https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/technology/mark-zuckerberg-meta-ai.html
> 
> On Tuesday, Meta is expected to announce that it will split its A.I. division - which is known as Meta Superintelligence Labs - into four groups, two people with knowledge of the plans said. One will focus on A.I. research; one on a potentially powerful A.I. called “superintelligence”; another on products; and one on infrastructure such as data centers and other A.I. hardware, they said. The moves are aimed at better organizing Meta so it can develop A.I. products more quickly to compete with others, the people said.
> 
> Some A.I. executives are expected to leave, the people said. **Meta is also looking at downsizing the A.I. division overall - which could include eliminating roles or moving employees to other parts of the company** - because it has grown to thousands of people in recent years, the people said. Discussions remain fluid and no final decisions have been made, they said.
> 
> In what would be a shift from Meta using only its own technology to power its A.I. products, the company is also actively exploring using third-party artificial intelligence models to do so, the people said. That could include building on other “open source” A.I. models, which are freely available, or licensing “closed source” models from other companies.
> 
> The changes follow months of tumult and restructuring at Meta over its A.I. strategy. Mr. Zuckerberg, 41, is sparing no expense and is willing to upend his company to stay relevant in A.I. as the push to create the most advanced technology has boiled down to a few key players. How Meta will fare is being closely watched, as the A.I. race creates new winners and losers.
> 
> Mr. Zuckerberg’s determination was evident in June after Meta struggled to advance its newest A.I. models. That month, the company announced a superintelligence lab dedicated to creating an A.I. more powerful than the human brain. Meta invested $14.3 billion in the start-up Scale AI and brought on Alexandr Wang, its chief executive, as its new chief A.I. officer. Meta also offered some nine-figure pay packages to hire researchers from rivals like OpenAI and Google, igniting a Silicon Valley poaching war.
They haven’t a clue what they are doing Just buy more GPUs and researchers! I’m not exaggerating when I say multiple recruiters from Meta have reached out multiple times over the last 6-8 months. The emails all kept saying they are expanding this org or that org (mostly AI ones as well)

edit: Another thing i can share is that anecdotally i've heard from friends who know people in meta is that the stock has been doing well so people whose rsu have raised in value are being laid for cheaper talent in the same level/region. It seems like LLM model progress is slowing across some of the top AI companies.. I'm curious if we see shifts among other companies and what downstream impacts this will have on AI infrastructure providers This happened with me as well. They seem like they’re trying to hoard talent to stop other competitors from developing their AI solutions They dumped a ton of money into the metaverse. That went nowhere. 

They dumped a ton of money into AI. That hasn’t paid off yet, seemingly based on this decision. 

They seem kinda rudderless. 

But at least their ad revenue is flowing in. More data centers! More gpu’s! More compute! More power!!! Who could have possibly known that requiring an exponential amount of new data to get linear, or even sub-linear, improvements would eventually become unsustainable... oh yeah all of the researchers saying this for over a year. Appears as if it's time for round 3 of ""It's over"" involving AI.

1muhtwm,2025-08-19,"(08/19) Interesting Stocks Today - Softbank's Takes Stake in INTC!
Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [Intel's Ceo Draws Support For Revival From Softbank Trump](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-19/intel-s-ceo-draws-support-for-revival-from-softbank-trump?srnd=homepage-americas)

[**INTC (Intel)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTC&p=d)\-SoftBank is buying stock equal to roughly 2% of Intel’s outstanding shares in a $2 billion investment, driving the stock up!! News hit AH yesterday, ultimately interested to see if INTC makes another run at the open and if we can sustain- we've made a massive 6% move already. Despite the bearish news of  US government potentially using CHIPS Act grants to buy equity in the company, SoftBank news seems purely bullish until we get more details. This hasn't moved other semis much (NVDA/AMD unaffected). Thank you Nana!!!

[**OPEN (Open Door)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OPEN&p=d)\-Carrie Wheeler resigned as chair and CEO and the board launched a search for her replacement. This has caused the stock to explode from $2.50 -> $4. Again, this has meme stock written all over it. Not too interested in any long-term plays, but interested in seeing if we can break $5 again. Currently short-biased.  Personally, I don't think this can make any kind of sustainable move because it's way too liquid to make any of those epic squeezes we've seen from other companies in the past- illiquidity is what drives the massive moves when people get squeezed. 

[**VKTX (Viking Therapeutics)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VKTX&p=d)\-Its experimental obesity pill disappointed in a mid-stage study, marking another weaker-than-expected result for an oral alternative to popular weight-loss injections. ""VK2735, helped patients lose up to 12.2% of their body weight. However, roughly 28% of patients dropped out of the trial in just three months, dampening hopes that the pill could compete with treatments from LLY/NVO."" Had an epic spike to the upside then sold off close to 35%-mainly looking for a bounce in this stock if we reach $25 again.

[**APLD (**Applied Digital Corp**)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=APLD&p=d)\-Announced they were breaking ground on Polaris Forge 2 - a $3B, 280MW AI factory in North Dakota. Cited ""unprecedented demand for AI compute infrastructure"". Interestingly enough, Sam Altman said yesterday that investors were ""overexcited about AI"".

Anyway, this stock has near doubled in the past 3 months and I'm interested to see if we can hold above $16. Hyperscalers are only viable if there's unrelenting demand and it seems that there isn't any reduction of demand (for now).

**Earnings today:** [**NBIS**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NBIS&p=d)
People believed Apple was fatal before the turn around, people believed AMD was on its last fumes before they got Ryzen, people believed GE was done before the split. 

Point is, no one really knows. The new CEO seems capable and having the US government actively indicating the survival of the company is important for national security isn't negative news for a very long time. Not to mention, despite the constant Reuters articles saying 18a is trash, I've been reading other perspectives - that they haven't caught up to TSMC, but have taken a massive step forward and now various institutions are looking to participate. You don't think Trump might be able to push apple or Nvidia to take a chance on Intel for their already capacity constrained projects? You don't think something might be in the works with SoftBank owned ARM down the road? Dilutive or not, there appears to be a growing sense of confidence from prospective investors and clients.

They're not out of the woods, but for the first time they have a ton of options emerging. Semis are national security. The US government won't let Lockheed or Boeing die, they will make sure Intel survives and thrives. I agree with OPEN.  To me this has the smell of MMs repeatedly raking retail over the coals with each pump and dump.

INTC I'm in heavily.  USG investment essentally sets a floor for this stock, your only risk is opportunity cost. The SoftBank/intel deal is dilutive. It’s a primary issuance of new shares. Not sure why the price is going up on such a small percentage of intel value… There was absolutely nothing of value to your comment other than ""trust me bro, I'm from the internet."" INTC looks like a clear ""sell the news"" situation IMO. their products and technology have fallen so far behind that I believe it's fatal. Welp we were right about OPEN for the short term lol Something I’ve noticed lately is that stocks still move up regardless if dilution is far enough in the future. One example is GME lol Grandma says hodl It is really tough because American is not good in manufacturing.  Intel obviously have no problem making the chip.  But can they make it cheaply and with small defect(good yield)? I think there's going to be an acceptance that there will need to be a premium for first getting the manufacturing knowledge back to the US and then a premium for making it work. I think the national security angle overrides the market in this case. Obviously no company wants to pay a premium for products that they can get cheaper elsewhere, but I do think they might be willing to pay a premium if the biggest bully in the room is saying if you want to continue what you're doing you're going to have to give some concessions. Also, despite what the big chip players might say, it's better long term for them to have a second source option. Sure it could be Samsung, but Samsung isn't doing that hot either.",42,0.83,21,0,WinningWatchlist,stocks,['NVDA'],0819 interesting stocks today softbanks takes stake intc hi exprop shop equity trader daily watchlist shortterm trading might trade allnone stocks listed even stocks listed targeting potentially good candidates shortterm trading opinion investments potential stock moving today makes interesting everything else secondary news intels ceo draws support revival softbank trump intc intel buying stock equal roughly 2 intels outstanding shares 2 billion investment driving stock news hit ah yesterday ultimately interested see intc makes another run open sustain weve made massive 6 move already despite bearish news us government potentially using chips act grants buy equity company softbank news seems purely bullish get details hasnt moved semis much nvdaamd unaffected thank nana open open door wheeler resigned chair ceo board launched search replacement caused stock explode 250 4 meme stock written interested longterm plays interested seeing break 5 currently shortbiased personally dont think make kind sustainable move way liquid make epic squeezes weve seen companies past illiquidity drives massive moves people get squeezed vktx viking therapeutics experimental obesity pill disappointed midstage study marking another weakerthanexpected result oral alternative popular weightloss injections vk2735 helped patients lose 122 body weight however roughly 28 patients dropped trial three months dampening hopes pill could compete treatments llynvo epic spike upside sold close 35mainly looking bounce stock reach 25 apld applied digital corp breaking ground polaris forge 2 3b 280mw ai factory north dakota cited unprecedented demand ai compute infrastructure interestingly enough sam altman said yesterday investors overexcited ai anyway stock near doubled past 3 months im interested see hold 16 hyperscalers viable theres unrelenting demand seems isnt reduction demand earnings today nbis people believed apple fatal turn around people believed amd last fumes got ryzen people believed ge done split point one really knows new ceo seems capable us government actively indicating survival company important national security isnt negative news long time mention despite constant reuters articles saying 18a trash ive reading perspectives havent caught tsmc taken massive step forward various institutions looking participate dont think trump might able push apple nvidia take chance intel already capacity constrained projects dont think something might works softbank owned arm road dilutive appears growing sense confidence prospective investors clients theyre woods first time ton options emerging semis national security us government wont let lockheed boeing die make sure intel survives thrives agree open smell mms repeatedly raking retail coals pump dump intc im heavily usg investment essentally sets floor stock risk opportunity cost softbankintel deal dilutive primary issuance new shares sure price going small percentage intel value absolutely nothing value comment trust bro im internet intc looks like clear sell news situation imo products technology fallen far behind believe fatal welp right open short term lol something ive noticed lately stocks still move regardless dilution far enough future one example gme lol grandma says hodl really tough american good manufacturing intel obviously problem making chip make cheaply small defectgood yield think theres going acceptance need premium first getting manufacturing knowledge back us premium making work think national security angle overrides market case obviously company wants pay premium products get cheaper elsewhere think might willing pay premium biggest bully room saying want continue youre youre going give concessions also despite big chip players might say better long term second source option sure could samsung samsung isnt hot either

This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on technical analysis (TA), but if TA is not your thing then just ignore the theme.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

WTF are you talking about dude RKLB, NVDA, AMD, RDDT, MSFT and GOOGL leading me down the shitter today. Not complaining too bad given the money they've made me over the year, but man. Really hoping this isn't the beginning of a bigger selloff.

1mu90q5,2025-08-19,"Brief overview of Eli Lilly's cardiometabolic pipeline
1.) Orforglipron (Phase III, expected submission Q4 2025): this is their small molecule oral GLP-1 agonist. There was much disappointment about trial results and all that, but one thing that isn't in doubt is this, it'll be cheaper and easier to make. That means scalability and margin. Better pricing means more insurance coverage, etc. 

2.)  Retatrutide (Phase III, expected submission 2H 2026 ): this is their new blockbuster injectable Triple G agonist. In addition to GLP-1 and GIP, it also targets Glucagon receptors. The main takeaway from this mediation is that it gives around 25% loss in body weight while maintaining lean muscle mass. In fact, grey market reta is routinely abused by body builders. There are cardiac adverse effects that need to be elucidated but all in all it's looking like a blockbuster med just around the corner.

3.) Eloralintide (Phase II): this is their Amylin receptor agonist. Targets another hormone that helps with diabetes and obesity. It is being explored as monotherapy and in combination with Tirzepatide. The combination would traget GLP-1, GIP, and Amylin. You can also imagine they can combine it with Retatrutide and get a Quad Agonist...

4.) Bimagrumab (Phase II): this is their Activin Type II Receptor blocker. This med decreases fat storage and increases muscle growth. It is being studied as a quarterly IV with or without semaglutide, and as a weekly injectable with or without Tirzepatide. This one could be big.

5.) Naperiglipron (Phase II): this is their second small molecule oral GLP-1 agonist. One to watch out for since people think Orforglipron is a dud.

6.) Mazdutide (Phase III in china where LLY relinquished their rights, Phase II for elsewhere): this is their GLP-1/Glucagon dual agonist. Easy to see why they are all in on Reta, but they have this guy in their back pocket.

7.) Nisotirostide (Phase II): this is their NPY2 receptor agonist. It works by suppressing appetite and possibly increased energy expenditure. 

8.) Macupatide (Phase I): this is their GIP agonist. 

9.) ""Oral GGG Peptide"" (Phase I): this could be oral Reta or another new peptide. If both of their small molecule oral GLP-1 agonists fail, then this could be ""the one"".      



Very quickly i want to list what NVO has in Phase II and III and you can compare for yourself:

\-Oral semaglutide 25mg

\-semaglutide 7.2mg

\-cagrilinitide (amylin analog)

\-CagriSema (cagrilinitide/semaglutide combo)

\-amycretin (injectable and oral GLP/amylin dual agonist)

\-monlunabant (CB1 receptor inverse agonist)

\-""Weekly GLP/GIP agonist""

NVO seem to be heavy into amylin receptor pathway... will that bet pay off?
Amylin analogues have a much better side effect profile, hence why I believe it will be the eventual winner Looks like a decent pipeline We’ll have to wait and see.

The first one that started with this was Zealand Pharma, another Danish company but largely unknown at that time.

Even if Lilly doesn’t have one right now, they have the resources to start programmes whenever they want.

I don’t expect any one company to win this race, it will be a huge market with many players Don't forget lepodisiran — any pharma company that makes a drug that basically prevents you from developing inherited heart disease (94% reduction in Lipoprotein A levels) is going to print money. Decent, but not so exiting. I'm buying both LLY and NVO because they both have exciting things in the pipeline and both stocks are priced at a discount right now. A moment of silence for our $VKTX bagholder brethren out there.... 

Another one bites the dust....

LLY, IYKYK... yes which is why i think NVO put all their eggs in that basket.... amylin also theoretically is better for maintaining lean muscle mass than GLP/GIP but there isn't a whole lot of human data to support that at this time. 

all the while LLY went ahead with Reta  and Bimagrumab which i think if it works out will be a blockbuster drug. both specifically targeting preserving lean muscle mass and fat loss not just losing weight... Yes i purposefully went after the DM/Obesity market in this post because it prints money... >I don’t expect any one company to win this race, it will be a huge market with many players

This. It's a very big market.

In the name/sake of competition though, I hope Amycretin (Oral) and CagriSema (Injection) bests Orforglipron (Oral) and Tirzepatide (Injection).

1mu2zqa,2025-08-19,"$NVDA C.J. Muse, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, called the demand for AI compute “seemingly insatiable” in a recent note
C.J. Muse, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, called the demand for AI compute “seemingly insatiable” in a recent note and raised his price target from $200 to $240 on Monday, for one of the highest targets on Wall Street. Sustained capital-expenditure investments from hyperscalers, increased sovereign investments and adoption of enterprise AI are driving demand for GPUs even higher than originally expected, according to Muse. Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh pointed out that Big Tech capex estimates have increased in recent months from 38% to 54% year over year. With analysts boosting outlooks on AI demand and hyperscaler capex, stocks like PLTR, BGM, CRM, and CRWV stand to benefit from the accelerating investment cycle.

Expect the magnitude of earnings beats to increase going forward, Muse wrote. He is anticipating second-quarter revenue of $48 billion and earnings of $1.06 per share. He’s also expecting Nvidia to raise guidance going into the third quarter.

Mizuho is predicting $46.2 billion of revenue and earnings per share of $1.01. Rakesh raised his Nvidia price target from $192 to $205.

Morgan Stanley anticipates $46.6 billion in revenue and EPS of $1.03 for the second quarter.

1mtwmw4,2025-08-18,"Volkswagen gates a new vehicle’s full horsepower behind monthly subscription
https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/volkswagen-gating-a-new-vehicles-full-horsepower-behind-monthly-subscription-3239138/

> Volkswagen’s ID3 Pro and Pro S vehicles are some of their latest car models, and, while they look like a typical car the iconic vehicle manufacturer would deliver, there’s a secret under the hood. For both of these models, the maximum horsepower is listed at 228bhp (brake horsepower). However, driving the vehicle normally, you can only push it to 201bhp. In order to get that extra power out of it, you’ll have to pay extra. At around $20 a month, $200 a year, or a lump sum payment of roughly $760 dollars, you can get that full horsepower. And, while it’s difficult to imagine why the ID3 models are limiting themselves and forcing a paywall for users who want to put the pedal to the metal, Volkswagen explained their reasoning behind the change.

> The way that the sub works for their ID3 vehicles is incredibly bizarre. Rather than it being tied to any one driver, the sub is tied to the vehicle. So, for instance, if someone were to pay the full price of buying that power boost for life and they were to sell their ID3 secondhand, whoever got the car next wouldn’t have to pay for it. Volkswagen views the service as a way to offer people more power under the hood without having to sell them a new car.

> “Offering more power to customers is nothing new – historically many petrol and diesel vehicles have been offered with engines of the same size, but with the possibility of choosing one with more potency.

1mtqafw,2025-08-18,"$NXDR the next social media stock to pop off with improved programmatic ads
TL;DR: NXDR is RDDT a year early with rising organic traffic, ad model flip to programmatic, $100M in buybacks, $400M cash pile, new (and successful app revamp), and homeowners as a captive ad audience. Market cap only $700M.

**Ad Model Upgrade:**  
Historically, Nextdoor has been selling clunky zip code packages to realtors with little intent, targeting, or efficiency.  But with the launch of NEXT, they've flipped the switch to programmatic ads and even though they are currently intentionally holding back impressions on ads this model is set to skyrocket revenue with proper programmatic ads.  Their new faves section gives deeper scroll depth, higher engagement, and tastiest of all MUCH BETTER CPM's.  This type of switch is a massive boon to revenue per user and for an example of what can happen to revenue per user take a look at what happened to reddit when they improved their ad stack.  This type of advertising upgrade was historically difficult and took a ton of money and talent to build out, but now with AI what used to take a team of engineers years to build can now be prototyped in weeks. A competent self serve ad option isn't the barrier it once was, now it's all about users and NXDR is in around 1/3 of US households.  That's right the tastiest ad dollars, homeowners.  
**Growing demand:**  
The Net Promoter Score is something that NXDR uses to see how likely people are to promote the app to their friends, with their latest switch (in July so not on this quarter yet) they have the highest NPS they've ever had which means that people are liking the new Nextdoor app (this was announced on the earnings call).  This growth has NOT shown up on their quarterly reports but you can see it in google trends where searches for 'nextdoor app' are the highest they've been since the end of 2022.  Additionally searches for Nextdoor Ads are absolutely skyrocketing with their self serve option and are the highest they've ever been (3X this month).  For one more piece of data I took a look at Sensor Tower and their app is now #2 in the app store for News/Social Media which is a leap from their historic spot at around #5.  (Note this is not the pure social media section).

I can't show images on r/stocks but you can do the searches yourself

Here is the [Nextdoor Ads](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=nextdoor%20ads&hl=en) here is the trends for [Nextdoor App](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&q=nextdoor%20app&hl=en) (Change to 5 years to see the data before the last 90 days).

**Massive Organic (Search) Growth**  
Just like RDDT, Nextdoor is benefiting from googles stance of wanting to push authentic experiences and information.  Their SEMrush chart is showcasing great growth, nearly doubling since January 2023.  But more importantly it's up almost 10% in the last month which is going to push the user growth flywheel.

**Financial Setup**  
They are free cash flow positive for the past 3 quarters and have a cash pile of 400 million with no debt.  This makes it a safe play in these choppy markets as the market cap is only 700 million.  Limited downside, big upside.

**Buybacks!**  
They still have a facility with almost 100 million left in it that expires March 31st and have been retiring shares (using the facility) for the last 2 quarters.  I would expect that they are trying to use up the buybacks before March 31st so this quarter will be the heaviest buyback period.  You can see on the chart that after the date of record of their last quarterly report (june 30th) there has been a great support line trending upwards.  This is the buybacks (likely).  So they are using their great financial position to reduce the float and could retire 250k shares a day from now until March 31st.  At these prices and with their facility they could remove nearly 20% of the float.  With lowering interest rates (potentially) and great response to their new platform, they will be reducing their cash position by reducing the float.

This is almost exactly the setup that Reddit had previously with google pushing organic traffic, organic growth going, and a solid user base.  But what is really going to drive this stock price through the roof is the switch to programmatic ads.  This last gangbusters report for RDDT didn't have stellar user growth compared to previous periods (Q1 31% growth and Q2 21% growth YOY), but what they did have was amazing revenue growth and that is what we are going to see from NXDR.

In these choppy times this play has limited downside (massive cash reserves with FCF positive) and a genuinely massive upside as they can easily increase ad revenue by 50-100%

Positions:  150,000 shares.
Nope. Can't compare to Reddit. Reddit became big because you were able to interact with people with similar interests while maintaining anonymity. Facebook already has so many groups for every local community out there. 

Sure, it can grow and do well, but I just don't see the problem the app is trying to solve. It's good for the small group of people who want local updates without creating a FB account. I'm not sure that's sustainable. Who? I think it's like LinkedIn - sucks. Lol, whatever you say It won’t pop off like $OPEN because the short interest is too low and the cash pile is too big.

It’s not a short squeeze which I guess is what everyone is looking for these days but the buybacks will make for a tasty long term chart (and provide a solid floor).  This is like a 10-20% a month play for the next 6 months.

Although there is still 5x potential over the course of a few years.  You’re just not gonna get that 5x in a couple of weeks type of action you see in the meme stocks.  Although I do like the potential for some people to think that NEXTdoor is the obvious next play after opendoor.  It’s just that the catalyst isn’t there for the short squeeze. I added this to my watchlist after Jason Calacanis mentioned it on his podcast on Friday about it being mismanaged. I figured it would be another Opendoor type pop, was hoping it would get a smidge closer to its 52 week low before going in but looks like I missed it. Imagine we'll see some posts like this on various subs like WSB in the immediate future. It has many of the same similarities as RDDT in terms of organic growth from google being a potential flywheel for new users.  This is demonstrated by google prioritizing nextdoors website for local content where they are now ranking for more things.

I am not saying it will be the same size as Reddit, but it's currently trading at 1/60th of the market cap as Reddit and the user growth story is just getting started with the app relaunch and it's positive reception so far.  I don't think it will ever be a larger company than Reddit.

They don't show users in the same manner but just as an example reddit's average weekly users is around 400 million and nextdoor weekly average users is around 45 million.  Reddit probably has larger scroll depth and time on site but nextdoors users are valuable as they are predominantly homeowners and have great location targeting.

The growth case here is in the revenue which will grow substantially this year as they increase ad impressions and number of advertisers using the platform, but the user case is also in the early stages of being pretty exciting as well with how they are trending on google trends/organic search results/app downloads.

Again I'm not saying that nextdoor will ever be larger than reddit, but I am saying that their revenue is going to see that same increase that Reddit did over the last year. Nextdoor.  It’s more than lost cats and a neighbourhood watch program.

And even if it is, homeowners are what advertisers crave.",0,0.33,8,0,TheOneNeartheTop,stocks,['GOOGL'],nxdr next social media stock pop improved programmatic ads tldr nxdr rddt year early rising

1mtnfva,2025-08-18,"Neocloud Operators (like $CRWV) Depend on Nvidia Chips Staying Expensive
>Once upon a very recent time, Nvidia Corp.’s H100 was the crown jewel that everyone in AI was after. A badge of honor in model-training runs, the chip defined an era of bragging rights among artificial intelligence developers. But as Nvidia commits to annual generational leaps, and boss Jensen Huang sells each one as profoundly essential, the question of what to do with older hardware rises in importance.

>CoreWeave Inc., a close partner to Nvidia and one of the newfangled neocloud providers, has an idea for solving that challenge. It’s not glamorous or particularly ingenious, but it neatly ties together the two key processes in AI work - training, the most intensive but briefer operation of cramming information into your AI model, and inference, which is the more voluminous and workmanlike job of querying that library of data to produce hopefully smart-sounding responses. When the time comes to upgrade, CoreWeave just uses the outdated cutting-edge hardware on the simpler job.

>“What happens is, the prior generation begins to pick up the load on inference,” Chief Executive Officer Michael Intrator told me last week. “We are not seeing meaningful declines in H100 demand, which is the prior generation of the Grace Blackwell, which is the cutting edge right now.”

>There’s what he called “broad-based inference demand absorbing that compute” - compute being the industry term for computational power. Many of the same customers shopping for the most advanced chips for their model training are also “looking to support the ever-growing demands of inference.”

>That’s one of the biggest deployers of Nvidia’s high-performance compute making the case that we don’t need the very latest for every task. Inference has proven friendly to hardware that’s one cycle old. If CoreWeave is right, the real economic story of GPUs may be not just the rush to the newest silicon, but the expanding afterlife of what might have been considered obsolete.

>CoreWeave sits at the center of that story. It isn’t a fully-formed hyperscaler in the mold of Amazon Web Services ot Microsoft Corp.’s Azure; its neocloud designation refers to how tailored its infrastructure is for AI workloads.

>The business model is simple in theory, punishing in practice: borrow heavily to build specialized data centers, line up customers like OpenAI and Microsoft, and rent compute at scale. It’s high-growth, but it’s also high-risk - utilization has to stay very high to cover the financing, and the resale value of yesterday’s silicon matters a lot more than in the hyperscaler world.

>That’s why H100s showing up in the secondary market are worth watching. Resales - and their price - may either validate or cast some doubt on CoreWeave’s reasoning.

>Hyperscalers rotate out old hardware quickly; for them, training always moves to the latest chips and inference often runs cheaper elsewhere. Neocloud operators face more pressure. Miss utilization targets, or buckle under financing costs, and you’ll have to start selling off the hardware as a release valve. The result: racks of lightly used H100s hitting the market at steep discounts, reminding everyone that obsolescence in this business comes on a 12–18 month cycle.

>All of that landed with a thud on Wall Street this past week. CoreWeave reported widening losses, surging capex, and an outlook that spooked investors who had bid the stock up severalfold since its IPO. Shares slumped 21% the day after earnings and gave up another 15% the following day. The message was clear: demand for AI compute may be unprecedented, but scaling fast enough to meet it - without crushing margins - is proving harder than the hype cycle suggested.

>The obsession with cutting-edge hardware makes for flashy launches, investor buzz, and multibillion-dollar stock swings. But the deeper story may be how older generations of silicon are repurposed - whether by neocloud operators wringing inference value out of the previously prized GPUs or hyperscalers rotating stock into resale markets.

Considering how Deepseek can't release their new model due to how terrible huawei's alternative is, I have a feeling these chips will stay expensive for a while. You didn't read the article lol. It's certainly true that frontier model players are looking to get their hands on latest and greatest for time efficiency in training. 

But it's an uninformed take that prior generation AI GPU don't have business value.  Microsoft and OpenAI use CRWV in part for overflow, when their existing hardware can't support the load.  Much of this load is inference as they both sell AI services and aren't exclusively in training mode.  

Doesn't need to be latest and greatest - the resource is scarce, it just needs to have reasonable response time.  OpenAI needs to enforce limitations because there is not enough resource to meet usage.  Go and research OpenAI and rate limits and you will find endless complaints from their paying users because usage can be cutoff or limited based on capacity constraints. Yep, from what I know the Chinese chips that can be mass-manufactured NOW (not the experimental models that are on par with NVDA's chips) are essentially 2 or more years behind because it can take 5 years to build the fabs Wrong! 

Considering NVDA has invested/partnered with CRWV & NBIS.

Funny because this exact shit happened with telecom equipment purchased from Cisco in the tech bubble. The exact same shit is happening now with NVDA GPUs... except its MUCH MUCH MUCH WORSE.

Reason its worse is because 1, the scale of margin and investment is much higher. And 2, many companies are using their inventory or GPU value as collateral on loans, when the collateral doesnt actually exist due to the fraudulent depreciation methods companies are using.

Who knows how long this ""party"" (read: fraud) goes on for, but the fact the financial times is starting to write about it means its gonna start spreading through more people soon.

1mtlpzw,2025-08-18,"Comcast Gets Serious About Subscriber Losses - A Long Fight Looms
Comcast Corp. has a problem - the company is losing customers in its most significant business, providing internet access to nearly 30 million American households.

The Philadelphia-based telecom and media conglomerate has reported record losses of broadband subscribers for three straight quarters, more than half a million accounts in total, after pandemic-related federal subsidies for low-income customers ended and telecom companies like T-Mobile US Inc. got much more aggressive offering consumers alternative options.

Comcast Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts and his team have jumped into action, bringing in new management at the broadband division, introducing new pricing plans and pushing harder into other products, such as wireless phone service, to complement their internet offerings and cable TV. Still, there’s no immediate end in sight to the cancellations.

“We’re not offering predictions around when they’ll get back to positive adds,’’ Chief Financial Officer Jason Armstrong said in an interview. “But everything we’re doing now is designed to put us back on a much better trajectory.”

For years the company founded by Roberts’ father with the purchase of a single pay-TV franchise in Tupelo, Mississippi, was the king of cable. But as consumers have canceled those pricey TV packages in favor of streaming services like Netflix Inc., Comcast’s video business has shriveled. At 11.8 million, the company’s cable-TV customers amount to fewer than half their peak in 2008. With that business shrinking, Comcast no longer has the easy sell of asking a cable customer to sign up for internet access too.

“Pay TV cord-cutting was really the catalyst that started impacting broadband because you’re no longer in a bundle,” said streaming media consultant Dan Rayburn. “And the value was always in the bundle.”

Comcast got a boost during the pandemic, along with other providers, as consumers realized they couldn’t function without reliable home internet. Short-lived federal subsidies for internet access also helped Comcast add broadband customers between 2020 and 2022. But the tide began to turn for the company in mid-2023.

T-Mobile, AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. have been tapping their wireless networks to deliver internet access at prices that attract budget-conscious consumers. The big three telecom carriers added over 900,000 so-called fixed-wireless accounts in the second quarter alone. Comcast and its peers have historically provided Internet access through a mix of fiber and coaxial cable connections, but the three major telecom companies have also been investing in speedy fiber-optic lines right to the home.

The pressure has forced Comcast management to respond on several fronts. The company has been offering cheaper plans at slower speeds for low-income consumers. In April, Comcast introduced a new internet pricing program for all customers, including a 5-year price guarantee. Plans start at $55 a month, including taxes and equipment fees. The new pitch is a departure from the strategy of the past, which typically involved discounting a customer’s first year or two and then applying a steep increase in monthly charges.

The company has also stepped up promotion of its wireless phone service. Subscribers to the 5-year internet plan get a free mobile line for one year. Under a long-running deal with Verizon and increasing use of its own infrastructure, Comcast is able to undercut its competitors with a lower-priced mobile offering, according to Armstrong. The company added a record 378,000 wireless lines in the second quarter.

The theory is that internet customers will stick with Comcast, thanks to the price guarantee, and ultimately pay for wireless phone service too. Early signs suggest that customers are also choosing faster speeds, and thus more costly internet plans, an encouraging trend, according to Armstrong.

“Right now the No. 1 product attaching to broadband is wireless,’’ he said. “That is the bundle of the future.”

The company has reorganized management of its connectivity business in the US, promoting Steve Croney to chief operating officer and hiring Jon Gieselman, a former Apple Inc. and DirecTV executive, as chief growth officer. It’s also taking steps to improve customer service.

Broadband troubles aside, Comcast has other businesses that it is investing in, including theme parks and business telecom services, and has managed to increase revenue every year since 2020. Later in 2025, it will spin off cable-TV networks such as MSNBC and USA, cutting a loose a business where subscriber revenue and advertising are challenged by the shift to streaming. Comcast has said its growth businesses, including residential broadband, will account for 65% of revenue after that separation is complete.

While the company works on its broadband problem, sales are forecast to be little changed this year and rise 3% in 2026. Unless there’s a turnaround, 2025 will go down as the fourth losing year for Comcast shares in the past five - with the stock down about 11% year to date, compared with an 10% gain for the S&P 500 Index.

“This is not a quick fix,” said Roger Entner, an analyst with Recon Analytics. “This is a multiyear technical and cultural shift. And culture is very hard to change.”

Comcast is a shit monopoly.  As soon as any competition comes up in an area they’re in, they file frivolous lawsuits to bankrupt the competitor.  

They should be marked as a utility if they would keep my rate the same instead of going thru the promotion dance every year i wouldnt have left. 

maybe if they had actual people to talk to for customer service.

everything about this company sucks and i switched my tv service as soon as i was able.

1mtljfu,2025-08-18,"(08/18) Interesting Stocks Today- Wegocy Weworks on Liver Fibrosis??
This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

[**NVO (Novo Nordisk)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVO&p=d)\-FDA approved Wegovy for treating MASH (noncirrhotic metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis) in adults with moderate-to-advanced liver fibrosis. From what I've read, this affects up to 5% of US adults. This is the first GLP-1 treatment approved for treatment and is potentially billions more for NVO. Of course, we still don't know the long-term efficacy of these drugs and other GLP-1s may be suitable for it as well (as we've seen with their weight-loss applications).

[**DAY (Dayforce)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DAY&p=d)\-Thoma Bravo (American PE firm) is reportedly in advanced talks to acquire Dayforce in a private buyout deal. Because this is mainly rumor, I'm interested in seeing what we do at the open. Of course, this is all speculation (but there's a Bloomberg article on it), so if the move gets unsustainable (and news isn't confirmed yet), I'm interested in a light short.

[**WULF (TeraWulf)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WULF&p=d)\-GOOG increased its financial backstop to $3.2B and expanded its potential equity stake in WULF to 14%. This exploded last Thursday and has been driving higher ever since, but we've close to doubled- watching $10 level at the open to see if we test/see where we go from there.

[**UNH (UnitedHealth Group)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d)\-Day 2 (4 if counting weekend) of the Buffett/Berkshire Hathaway stake disclosure (\~$1.6B). Still undervalued, but STILL has the DOJ case as a looming threat. Considering that BRK is willing to invest even with the DOJ as an overhang has probably assuaged investors/the market that UNH is a worthy investment, and thus the run. I'm mainly interested in the $300 level (though completely possible we never even touch that price today. The deathblow to this stock is losing access to Medicare funding and is the catalyst I'm mainly concerned about. Currently long.

1mt9vr5,2025-08-18,"Does value investing still work in this market?
Been watching names like TSLA, RDDT, APPL and COIN, but honestly it feels like earnings and fundamentals barely matter right now. Sometimes great numbers come out and the stock still tanks, or the opposite happens. Makes me wonder if the old-school way of picking stocks by digging into reports and waiting for “fair value” still works, or if it is time to focus more on sentiment, money flow and other stuff. 
Yes value investing absolutely works. But your methods for evaluating fair value are probably bad or outdated. The market still likes growing companies. The market still likes profitable companies. When poop hits the fan… people run away from momentum and go for PE/safety/dividends and moats. Do some financial modeling on RDDT. It's actually fairly priced.

The thing about RDDT is it doesn't rely much on user growth. It's just about implementing monetization, which is much more predictable. It's unique in that way compared to most growth stocks which rely on more unpredictable growth.

META's annual revenue per daily active person is \~$350 in US/CAN.

RDDT is \~$30 in the US and international monetization is just getting started.

On top of that they're growing users at 20% y/y currently. Valuations dont matter until they do, it always ends the same way 2022.

People's windows are too short and Value has a very uneven return profile. If it isn't painful there can't be a premia attached. (yes, ignore profitability- shoo!) Yep, value investing tends to underperform during strong bull markets. But it overpeforms in the longrun because it outperforms during bear markets and economic recoveries more than enough to compensate After a few cycles of running back and forth between growth and value the market shows you who the real value was. Also who the real growers were.  “The market is a voting machine in the short term, and a weighing machine in the long term”

Remember this phrase and understand short term price action is mostly influenced by sentiment, however long term buying good companies with real FCF growth will pay dividends. It’s also why you can buy great businesses at a discount and take advantage of market wide overreaction like in April.

Expectation and guidance matter more than great numbers, when expectations are high and a company doesn’t beat but still posts good numbers that’s when stocks fall, if guidance is lowered stocks fall. However tune out the noise and buy those great businesses cheaper while the market overreacts and you’ll do fine.

Look at things with a 5-10 year horizon, don’t be swayed by short term price action (less than 3 years) especially when the business is still doing great. If I see consistent FCF and earnings growth but the stock dropping I’m not going to be swayed much, if anything I’m happy I can buy at an even bigger discount and reap the rewards 5-10 years from now.

Unless the drop is accompanied by tangible and extended changes to the business, there is nothing to worry about. What bro said.

1msua5f,2025-08-17,"Why is this website not very interested in investing in Reddit (RDDT)?
A top 10 website in the world with fast growth and less than a $50bil market cap. We all saw what happened when META went public. I want to know the issues and fears, because it being 87.5% owned by firms is extremely concerning. I would have expected Reddit to be one of the most spoken about stocks here
Nobody hates Reddit more than Redditors

It could hit $1,000/share in a couple years and Redditors will still shit talk it

Reddit has an army of unpaid mods doing most of the work for them while they collect money from selling user data and ad space

Bullish I am bullish mainly because Reddit is becoming one of few properties where you can still find human generated content (amongst bots too) that's not just about what your friend had for dinner . 

In a world where internet content is increasing filled with AI slop, human content will become more valuable.

EDIT: Wanted to add that Reddit is THE world's most popular site that:
1. is publicly traded
2. isn't already owned by big tech

And like OP said, is less than $50B market cap. At IPO everyone laughed - at $230 a share everyone screamed overvalued - at crash (all stocks crashed) everyone was ”Told you so” - now being THE stock to own at $240 a share its overvalued.

Its the story of the many successful and popular stocks.

It was the same with Netflix. I had Netflix at $250 in 2022 sold it at $320 ever since then I’ve been watching it in pain its sitting currently at $1200 a piece. 🤣

I can name other stocks where everyone screamed overvalued Meta - Tesla - Palantir and Robin Hood to name a few. The only way this stock becomes meta is if your grandparents start using it. That's when Facebook numbers really took off. Every now and then I see posts from folks 60+ but guarantee if you asked a random 60+ year old in public what reddit was they'd say ""Huh?"" but 90% of them know Facebook by now. I think one of the issues is Reddit is anonymous which impacts its network effects. Also its greatest strength. We know what the site used to be compared to what it is now. It used to be a legit website with only real responses and real people, now it’s algorithms suggesting everything, bots left and right and psyop mass propaganda when anything major political happens. 90% here never did a dcf and are allergic to above 25 p/e Honestly this makes it sound like more of a buy somehow lol I can scream at far more stocks that were considered overvalued and did in fact crash.

1msh3o5,2025-08-17,"$APLD - 10 bagger AI DATA CENTER
APLD is positioning themselves as one of the few players building the kind of high-performance data centers that AI workloads actually demand. We're talking racks stacked with GPU's pulling power at a massive scale.

On paper, they've got around 400MW scheduled to come online nby 2027. That's just what's already been announced. Management has been clear that if they can line up more power, they'll keep scaling aggressively. And when you run the numbers, the revenue potential starts looking pretty wild.

Here's the simple math: industry rates for high-performance hosting earn about $.35 to $.50 per watt per month, with AI workloads usually toward the higher end. Annualied that's $6,000 per kW, or $6M per MW. Multiply that by 400 MW and you're looking at roughly $2.4B in yearly revenue potential.

Even if you haircut that for more conservative assumptions- say $.40/watt and a 45% margin - it still works out to a business throwing off serious cash. Data center operators at scale tend to run 50% EBITDA margins, so $2.4B in revenue would translate into \~1.2B in EBITDA. And right now the market is valuing infrastructure names feeding the AI boom at 10-20x EBITDA. That points to a market cap anywhere from $12B on the low end to north of $20B if they execute well.

The bigger lever, though, is capacity. If they can find another 200-300 MW to build out on top of the 400 MW roadmap, the earnings power scales dramatically. The real bottleneck here isn't GPUs - it's electricity. APLD's edge is that their sites are in power-friendly locations where expansion is actually possible.

I originally came across this stock while doing some modeling work on NVDA for a client. CoreWeave, which NVDA owns a stake in, cut a deal with APLD not long ago - and the stock ripped up 50%. APLD is essentially a landlord, and companies like CoreWeave are the tenants, leasing AI power.

Let me know your guys thoughts.
They already have a contract with Coreweave

They charge  $1.87M per MW per year

Nowhere near what you say Sharing one of the top comments from a recent Seeking Alpha article on ASPI-


Potential investors should be aware that there have been reports issued by small research firms including Equity Dispatch and Fuzzy Panda alleging that ASPI is likely to be a pump and dump stock promotion instead of a truly serious scientific operation. The company's Washington DC headquarters as listed in its SEC filings is nothing more than a Regus shared office space. The company's CEO Paul Mann has been an officer of three prior companies whose stock fell to zero. At one point over 6% of ASPI's stock was owned by family affiliates of Barry Honig, a notorious stock promoter who was fined by the SEC and banned permanently from involvement in stock operations. Honig and a cohort named John Stetson have been identified as major operators of more than 25 stock promotion companies where the stock dropped more than 99% after Honig and Steson had unloaded their shares to gullible investors. ASPI has paid several stock promotion companies like RedChip, Ocean Wall and Emerging Growth Conference to pump ASPI stock.
One report also claims the basic ""Quantum Enrichment"" isotope technology touted by ASPI is a technology that has been tried and abandoned by multiple companies and by government research facilities. Paul Mann, ASPI's CEO, has zero experience in the technologies under ""development"" by ASPI.
Are the negative reports valid? I don't know. But they raise a lot of questions about ASPI that investors should know about. Good DD.  I had to exit my position but I do feel like it's an under looked ai play and will re enter hopefully 

What I really want to find is the company that's going to power up all these data centers.  And not a nuclear startup 10 years away from maybe having a reactor. I work in distributed energy generation. Put any turbine or gas engine manufacturer on a dart board, and chances are you’ll hit someone currently under contract for datacenter power generation. 

Gas engine’s have shorter lead times right now. CAT, Everllence, MTU, Jenbacher (industry rumor is they are getting ready to go public), Wartsila. 

Diesel engines have been a huge play in data centers for several decades: CAT, Cummings, Rehlko (fka Kohler)

Turbines generally can produce more power per “shaft” than gas engines: ABB, Siemens, GE, some big names in this space

Battery energy storage is going to start taking off for datacenters shortly, if not already: CATL, Tesla, SAFT (owned by total energies), Powin (not sure who of these is public) 

Supercapacitors, if any manufacturers are public, could be another interesting play. Supposedly they can have 4x the daily throughput of a LFP BESS with less degradation - leading to a longer use of a component used for voltage and frequency stability in the datacenter itself. 

A vertical market investment here could be also investing into gas producers, midstream O&G, and gas utilities. A massive amount of natural gas is required to generate hundreds of megawatts of power off grid.  

A lot of this industry is manufactured in the EU, so the recent tariffs have been brutal for the industry to manage. Current market cap is 3.8b. My DD has our valuation coming in at 18-20b based on their current plan. 

I don't look at price history, I look at valuations. I'm buying now, and all the way back down to $5, it doesn't matter, as long as their plan stays the same. 

Also, that 18-20b is with factoring in the share dilution, as they will be purchasing capex via the equity pool/diluting stock. Working in the utility industry I can say a good portion of our work in the near future is going to be rebuilding/installing new transmission lines and substations to supply the necessary power for data centers A bit late to the party SMR looks interesting. Small nuclear reactors and they already have approval to start building Plenty of room to explode in the next few years. It's almost a guarantee. Beautiful. I cannot remember the accronmym, but APLD has a 1.13 direct energy use rate. Meaning that only 13% of the energy they consume goes to indirect uses (lights, and other stuff). This is considered very good for the industry I read online.

1ms0xfo,2025-08-16,"2X Leverage on 401k
My work allows me to use BrokerageLink with Fidelity. Basically allowing me to invest in what I want in my 401k retirement plan. I’m young, 23 years old, so I have a lot of time and don’t really care for the 50-60% dips that come with these products as I know the indexes will recover.

Over the past five years, QLD is up 184% while QQQ is up 110%. SPUU is up 155% while SPY is up 90%. My thought process is to use leveraged products until I’m 40-45 years old and once I’m closer to retirement I will get off of the leveraged funds.

Anybody have any insight (on if I should or shouldn’t do this) or thoughts on this? TYIA
There is a small group of people who holds TQQQ long term. Note that leverage product aims to produce the leveraged results per market day, not per annum. This means that a 10% drawdown a day would be 30%. 

Also, note that a small drawdown will require a significantly higher climb to reach breakeven. For example, a 50% drawdown will need 100% gain to recover. This principle is true everywhere but especially important in a leveraged product that has big swings both ways. 

Do your own math and see what your risk tolerance is. This is a very high risk, high rewards path. The wise thing would be to spread your port out between QLD, QQQ, and VOO so you arent over leveraged. The last 5 years are extremely not typical Cool, now pretend it existed in 1999 or 2008 and see what your total returns would be.

We haven’t had a real bear market since 2009. Shhhh don’t talk about r/TQQQ too loudly or you’ll summon them here. Let them lose everything Never go full regard, bruh Mutter TQQQ 3x and the regards from WSB will appear You’re going to get told no because of decay etc. “the last 5 years haven’t been typical” literally heard the same thing 5 years ago.

I hold a decent amount of TQQQ and have so for ~8 years. I used to do short term with TQQQ before then. I “hedge” with VOO/QQQ and buy TQQQ on market downturns.

1mrxh82,2025-08-16,"My picks for best companies under 15B market cap

THIS IS NOT FINANICAL ADVISE. JUST MY THOUGHTS AND OPINIONS. 

1. Innodata $INOD

What is Innodata? Innodata is a data engineering company that trains Ai. Ever heard of Alexander wangs company ScaleAi that teamed up with META? Or $NBIS’s Toloka? Or Google poaching windsurfs employees? They all do the same thing. Train Ai to learn. Innodata works with META, GOOGLE, APPLE, Xai, and more tech companies. They basically have 0 debt. And  revenues up 79% YoY. Raised guidance last quarter and CEO Jack stated there’s pretty much pipelines in place for growth. Market cap is less than 1.5Billion. With big techs Ai spend and increasing CapEx guidance, I see a booming company in a booming sector. 

2. $BROS Dutch Bros Coffee
A coffee chain that is very popular and growing in America. They are expanding rapidly throughout America, they started on the west coast and are quickly expanding east. Revenue growth of 30% YoY, last quarterly results basically confirmed to me that they can manage the growth while keeping debt under control. What’s even more bullish to me is that same store sales is increasing in a weak consumer spending environment. Starbucks same store sales are down for like the 6th quarter in a row, chipotle missed earnings. But Dutch bros rev is up, same store sales is up. This is super bullish to me. And to my knowledge they haven’t even expanded outside of the U.S. this is also there first FcF positive quarter. 

Would love to hear your thoughts and opinions on these companies.

Also would love to hear your opinion on your most bullish companies! 

Happy weekend everybody
I can't really see it with Dutch bros. They really watered down the investors by going from 80 million to 115 million shares. If I grow their earnings at a compounded 20% still only yields a fair value of 23 bucks assuming a 40 PE, and they just need a better track record before I would invest in them. I’m starting to watch Dutch Bros. Their space seems to be incredibly unhealthy drinks in a time where “healthy” options are constantly being pushed, but they’re still killing it. ONDS - ONDAS holdings - they have a large leadership team that have all held high positions at other businesses before coming to ONDAS . 
 The revenue is up like 500% yoy . They have made great partnerships recently with Detroit manufacturing, Palantir , Rift, etc… 
They partnered with Klear for operating capital .
 They just partnered with Rift to be able to have a presence overseas . 
ONDAS has like 21 patents , and they are in lots of different industries like AI, drones , communications, tech..
They have a strong cash position after doing an offering , so there shouldn’t be any more dilution. 
ONDAS has a growing backlog , and they have customers in many different sectors.

Plus , our oil and gas company uses ONDAS Ldar on their drones each week to inspect our pipelines and wellheads for gas leaks . They have always been great to work with! We have recommended them to neighboring companies and they have all started using them . 


Health in tech inc - HIT -  I made a post about them a few months ago when the share price was like 80cents . It’s now around $3.30 . 
 Already profitable. They did IPO last year and the share price dropped from $7 to 70cents for no reason. The price started to rise quickly, and has been well on its way back to where it was .
I’ve bought and sold 3 times already , and doubled my money each time. I currently hold 1000 shares 

Roadzen - RDZN -  it’s an AI insurance company that operates in USA, EU , India . They already have a great product that is being used by lots of companies.  Drivebuddy AI is the main product. They offer gap insurance that is streamlined . 
The company has been growing and cutting overhead costs. 
I have been averaging in over the last few months Man value investors. Everyone focused on PE as a sole metric to indicate a good value, yet ignore FCF, low interest debt, margin growth, revenue growth, and intelligent utilisation of low interest debt to expand. Along those same lines it's a small/mid cap company focused on growth, hence why a PE ratio doesn't assign proper value to a company that plans to grow into their PE. Not to mention the simple fact that PE ratio across the board for basically all sectors has risen to higher levels than buffet would deem investable....

Ok so, if dutch bros was a SAAS company, and the company was being evaluated using a rule of 40 score to determine if it's growth rate was sustainable, their rule of 60 score is 65. That's insanely healthy. And that's a more appropriate metric to utilize, if one were to only look at one metric. But their FCF, their operations being funded by FCF, and their intelligent use of low rate debt are also big positives. You’re gonna tank peoples portfolio with that AI washing dog ass INOD pick. Their financials look good because 61% of their Q1 revenue came from a single client. Insiders are actively dumping shares into people like you. They’re literally under investigation by the DOJ and the SEC for misrepresenting their AI capabilities, and they failed to disclose this investigation for seven months.

BUYER BEWARE. ASTS. just recently went over the $15b market cap but has a LONG runway. 5g to phones wholesaler to MNOs business model is very compelling, but most people have not caught on yet that the US military is about to shovel money at this company.  The Moat, once established, will be nearly impossible to compete against.  Their biggest risk was funding, and that has been largely removed.  Low estimates puts this at a 2-3x in 5 years and it'll be much much more than that in it's bull case. Home builders are breaking out lately, even Buffett increased hi position in. $LEN and another I think $KBH Who says value investors ignore that? PE certainly wasn't my only metric. I just evaluated many metrics from sales to free cash flow to grow the earnings at a rate I thought was fair. I was impressed by their lack of debt, but their growth rate on return on equity wasn't impressive. 

You have your strategy and value investors have theirs. And when someone's consistent in applying it across their decisions, it can work. It's my opinion, yes as a value investor, that BROS  doesn't mean the qualifications to buy at this moment from a value investors perspective and it's not something I put in my portfolio.  And I agree with you that the growth rate is probably healthy and substainable, but how does it compare to the current price it's selling for to predictably forecast stock price in the future? No, but My portfolio is heavily big tech concentrated, rotating little of my profits into sectors that have sold off isn’t such a bad idea.

1mrv9zj,2025-08-16,"Anyone else surprised that 98% of Meta's revenue comes from advertising?
https://i.imgur.com/z6ZEBOJ.jpeg



This quarter was the first time I really looked at Meta's financials in any detail and I was shocked to see that 98% of it comes from advertising. You frequently hear about Google's reliance on Search in investing subs across reddit but it's nowhere near 98% of their revenue ($46.6b of $47.5b) and yet I don't hear much about Meta's reliance. Is advertising really that sticky of a business model? How would Meta even 'win' AI by making Ads that much more effective?
Where else did you imagine their income comes from? Anyone else surprised that 98% Walmart's revenue comes from selling goods? Right?! Does anyone pay subscription fees?! Facebook and Instagram ads are huge The user data is used for advertising ""Senator, we run ads"" How is it not 100%? What else do they sell? A lot of people are clowning on OP but i feel like people are being a bit too harsh. It’s not that it’s surprising that Meta makes all its money on ads, it’s just that it’s shocking it’s one of the most successful companies out there and it’s moat is incredibly narrow. It’s *only* ads. 

Meanwhile companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon have an incredibly wide moat making their money on soooooo many different ventures. 

I feel like OP’s post is more in the line of, “dang, how is it that Meta is seen on the same page as Microsoft, Google, and Amazon when Meta only makes money off of ads when the others make money off of ads + thousands of other ventures.” Google a lottttt less than Meta.

I do not see Nvidia losing it's edge in the next year or two. Damn you're thick. And not the hot latina mommy kind. It would be news if he sold 5% or 10% of his shares. The fact that he still holds 99.99% of his shares in stock is a clear endorsement of NVDA's potential to continue to grow. yeah same reason why zuckerberg sold off huge chunks of his shares when it was at $200 through $400! what an idiot! how dare he and jensen derisk a portion of their entire net worth by selling off small stakes!! fools, i tell ya!

1mrq9ki,2025-08-16,"Thomson Reuters Q1 Beat but Is It Really That Impressive?
Thomson Reuters just reported Q1 2025 results with total revenue up 1% and organic revenue up 6%. The so-called ""Big 3"" segments posted an even stronger 9% organic growth, which is getting a lot of the usual bullish headlines right now.

But honestly, I’m not fully convinced this is as great as it sounds. Sure, organic growth looks good on paper, but a 1% total revenue increase feels pretty muted for a company of this size and scope. It makes me wonder if the headline numbers are masking some underlying softness or if there’s reliance on a few strong segments rather than broad-based strength. 

Also, the market usually prices in these kinds of steady but unspectacular beats pretty quickly. What really matters is if institutional sponsorship is clearly visible on the charts. Without that, all the nice press releases and growth percentages won't move the needle much. I've seen too many cases where the story looks good but the volume and big-money activity tell a different tale.

Are traders just glossing over the lack of meaningful top-line acceleration here? Or is there something else creeping into the valuation that the surface numbers don’t show? What’s your take on the sustainability of this growth and how much of it is already priced in? Does the chart action back up the headlines, or are we missing a red flag?
They will probably have a lot of AI-fuelled competition soon. I don't think they have the access to the curated legal documents that Thomson Reuters possess and has built up over decades. Not for their legal segment. Maybe for their tax and accounting segment. There are plenty of startups using AI being successful in the legal space.

1mrklgt,2025-08-16,"What might Trumpian meddling mean for Intel?
>What Intel needs more than new board members is customers for its manufacturing, or “foundry”, arm. They have not been forthcoming, partly because Intel’s chip-design business competes with would-be buyers such as AMD and Nvidia. A second transaction offers some clues as to how they might be persuaded. In July America’s Defence Department invested $400m in MP Materials, a producer of rare-earth metals, and will guarantee the price it receives for its output at above-market rates. A few days later Apple, involved in its own negotiations with the president, also announced a supply agreement with MP Materials. Mr Trump may demand that chip designers such as AMD and Nvidia, which rely on his approval to sell their products in China, use Intel’s manufacturing. A more radical option could see him force them to club together and purchase Intel’s struggling foundry business. That’s a deal any activist would be proud of pulling off.

If *The Economist*’s prediction comes true, which customers will Trump find for the 18A process? If Trump even goes so far as to force U.S. companies to adopt the 14A process, will Intel revive its foundry investments in 14A?

[https://www.economist.com/business/2025/08/15/what-might-trumpian-meddling-mean-for-intel](https://www.economist.com/business/2025/08/15/what-might-trumpian-meddling-mean-for-intel)
You know what the most curious thing about this was. Makes that post about the CEO, basically calls him a traitor, needs to resign, Intel drops to 19. Few days later, great guy, government might take a stake, intel was trading mid-25s today. If you knew this was going to happen you could have made millions very easily His friends and family bought at 18 and now they made billions. That's the reality. Trump's 'economic' team are really just sitting around coming up with new ways to pump and dump.

Makes me wonder how much better the market would be doing with a combination of solid economic and jobs numbers underpinning the AI boom while not having to contend with Trump constantly injecting new uncertainty into the situation for personal gains.

Unlike the dot com bubble AI related companies are posting solid profits. The AI economic revolution is being smothered by Trump and it's so fucking depressing. Love him or hate him this is good for the stock price and shareholders of INTC. Their revenues are down but they still make 12 billion a quarter. It's common knowledge at this point that Trump administration heavily manipulates the market. He made he a quick easy few grand but I’m out now. This thing could tank on any sudden news. I was bullish for Intel up until $23.50. The extra juice was just a bonus. I think it’s pump and dump, so I was very happy to take my winnings and run yesterday.

1mr5whs,2025-08-15,"ASTS - Debunking the “120 Mbps not enough for video” argument
Argument I am seeing a lot is everyone who subscribes to ASTS won’t be able to stream 4k video all at once. Yeah no shit, you can’t even do that on a terrestrial 5g when it’s jam packed Friday night at 9pm.

Are you going to be able to do online gaming in the middle of the desert by hot spotting from your phone? probably not, but that’s what something like starlink is for.

Google says most video live streaming uses 1.1mbps.

Alright, how often are you video calling someone when you are not connected to WiFi?

How often are you trying to use Spotify or Google maps or making a phone call, or some other application when not connected to WiFi? A lot more often. How about browsing instagram? This is the main use case that MOST people will use the service for most of the time.

Google Maps typically uses between 0.5 and 5 MB of data per HOUR for standard navigation.

Spotify's data usage, and thus its Mbps, depends on the streaming quality setting. For the lowest quality (24 kbps), it uses around 0.03 Mbps. For normal quality (96 kbps), it uses about 0.12 Mbps. High quality (160 kbps) uses approximately 0.2 Mbps, and very high quality (320 kbps), used by premium subscribers, uses around 0.4 Mbps

A voice call uses 0.064 mbps, while some codes can use as little as 8kbps (0.008 mbps).

General browsing on instagram uses 120-300mb per HOUR.

Live-streaming on instagram uses 1.1mbps (same as a video call).

YOUTUBE uses 1.1-2.5 Mbps for 480p video streaming.

The average population in a 450 km2 area in the US is approximately 16200 people.

A single beam (assuming total us coverage of 45-60 sats) will provide 120mbps. Once full constellation is up and a mesh network is  built (250 sats), you now have 4.166x-5.55x more throughput per 450 km2. Up to 666mbps per 450 km2.

With an average population density of 16200 people in 450 square kilometers (this includes high density areas, which is not the target for asts at this time. the density of those less populated areas will actually be less than the 16200 number), if 10% of the population is using ASTS’s service at the same time, that gives those 1620 people 0.411 Mbps each to utilize. More than enough for the low data apps you normally use.

Thats more than enough for that 10% to use Google maps, Spotify, and make a phone call and browse instagram ALL AT THE SAME TIME. Or, 1/5 of those people can all WATCH YOUTUBE AT THE SAME TIME. Or 1/3 of those people can all video call…AT THE SAME TIME!

And this is assuming there is no jump above the current limit of 120mbps by the time we get 250 sats up.

These numbers were all calculated assuming 250 sats (end game constellation). Yes, these numbers will be less when there are less sats up, duh.

You can do your own calculations now based on how many sats are up at any given time.
I've never heard 120 Mbps not enough for video Honestly it doesn't matter, it will be an invaluable service. Filling gaps in service, supplementing rural towers, real time demand mapping, providing connectivity to first responders, military coms, target identification, jam proof GPS and offensive radar jamming is more than enough to make the company plenty of money whether they can provide peak streaming speeds or not. I'm not sure you're conversant enough in network speak to be analyzing the practicalities of this. Like this senseless exercise in rounding:

>For the lowest quality (24 kbps), it uses around 0.03 Mbps. For normal quality (96 kbps), it uses about 0.12 Mbps. High quality (160 kbps) uses approximately 0.2 Mbps, and very high quality (320 kbps), used by premium subscribers, uses around 0.4 Mbps

24 Kbps is 0.024 Mbps, 96 Kbps is 0.096 Mbps, and so on. Just pick a unit of measure and stick with it.

Talking about sharing 666 Mbps amongst 1600 people and assuming all the bandwidth will be equally divided is naïve. No traffic shaping is so magical in its effectiveness. Plus they're going to reserve or prioritize bandwidth for some customers paying more or gov contracts for first responders, etc.

No reason why it won't be a reasonable service for many use cases but it's not so rosy as you think. Wrote it all myself Well, you_are_wrong_tho Even if it's a 100gb, 2 hour film, you only need around 110mbps ""A single beam (assuming total us coverage of 45-60 sats) will provide 120mbps. Once full constellation is up and a mesh network is built (250 sats), you now have 4.166x-5.55x more throughput per 450 km2. Up to 666mbps per 450 km2.""

Would you mind explaining this? So one satellite can only project one beam covering 450km2, or 21.2x21.2 km patch? What will other clients outside of this beam do while waiting for their turn? Is this…. Real? Netflix recommends 15Mbps for 4k streaming There are 10,000 beams per satellite (called cells, beam is just easier to understand at face value). Each satellite covers a gigantic area (450x10,000 square kilometers). That’s how they can provide continuous United States coverage with 45-60 satellites (albeit with less throughput than described in the calculations, final constellation is 250 sats, with continuous global coverage with 90 sats).

1mr5bwz,2025-08-15,"Meta stock split any time soon?
I see that meta stock price is nearing $800. Companies usually like to keep their stock price I would say around $100? Not a rule of thumb, just based of my observation, so I was thinking the board might consider a forward split to keep the share price more accessible to retail investors. Can we expect a split any time soon? Thought?
If a retail investor doesn't have $800 then who cares about them? Meh, also makes options on the stock require way more capital Stock is not missing out on anything nor is it gaining anything from splits I don't think that would happen until it passes $1000-1500, then probably a 5-1 or 10-1 split. Give it a couple years. Just a complete guess though. [deleted] You’re right, but not being allowed to buy a dollar amount, ie fractional shares would make me switch platforms. Nah. It can help with perception. Retail investors don't always think in fractional, there's no excitement in owning 1/5th of a stock. Also, a lower share cost can make price movements look more impactful, $2 movement on a $100/share is 2% where $2 on a $750 is 0.27%, no one cares about that. I think Mark likes to keep it exclusive.

1mqywbn,2025-08-15,"China abandoning CUDA?
There's a blog I follow around China and AI developments, to keep track of what's happening abroad instead of just domestic (I'm in the US). I'm not sure if I can link it here, I'll throw it into a comment just to be safe.

But the gist of it is China has funded a company that is trying to remove CUDA from the equation in the next 18-24 months which means all of the China revenue NVDA would generate would implode and who knows if the tech is cheaper and works better (or marginally worse but still by value is stronger) they could become a dominant player in the chips market.

There are a TON of factors that could either make this more or less legitimate of a concern but I thought it was something to keep an eye on.

**Edit:** oh my comment with the link got removed, DM if you want to read the blog (no stupid paywall).

**Edit2:** I'm seeing a lot of people misunderstanding, China is not trying to out compete NVDA in the market, they are funding a company to develop an alternative to CUDA that would be used inside of China by necessity and thus cut off China as a market for NVDA except for black market but that isn't going to be a very strong revenue source. So it isn't about them building something better to compete with NVDA in the global market.
The whole fucking world wants out from under the CUDA thumb. I would personally love to not have to rent expensive A100s for some stupid project my company won’t finance but I want to do just for curiosity.  CUDA has such a monopoly I doubt it doesn’t do anything. 

I guarantee you china has thought about breaking the windows monopoly and they can write a operating system as good as windows or even better (or already have) but no one will ever actually use it and no drivers will support it. 

Monopolies exist for a reason, especially software monopolies. Never thought I’d see the day when CUDA becomes the talk of geopolitics. Crazy. CUDA is not a monopoly if you know anything about ML. For example, Google's TPUs do not use CUDA, and neither do Meta, Microsoft, or Amazon's custom chips. AMD also provides tools to port CUDA code to HIP for compatibility with their hardware. CUDA is much easier to replace than windows.

There will be a performance cost as CUDA have lots of optimizations. But everything will still work which is different from Windows. 

https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/10879 HarmonyOS, takes time for adoption. And yes, it is Huawei. It is. But it’s not as if you can’t survive without CUDA. There are plenty of other options. You can do the exact thing that CUDA does with Open CL but it takes a bit longer as open CL is more of a general GPU programming language. AMD uses HIP which is another open source option. I'm guessing this is more about cracking the whip on domestic production of semi chips as an alternative in case of emergency. Basically improve the CCP's strategic options in case of trade war escalation (which will happen in the future). Chinese engineers right now have no reason to spend any time on internal production of chips since they have relatively good access to NVIDIA chips.

It does not mean China actually wants to abandon NVDIA. They know NVIDIA has the best chips and it's most cost efficient to buy and use them even if they're not the latest versions. They will continue to buy/smuggle them in.

China will likely have a competitive product in the future as they have the resources and impetus to do so. But that's not necessarily the right decision for them. Wouldn't doubt the capabilities of China though. I mean, normally I would agree, but for the Chinese government this will be something akin to the space race.

Motivations and resources get beyond any sane rationale. China will do anything in their power to not rely on Nvidia chips and software.

They never succeeded with anything that complex though.

1mqxpr6,2025-08-15,"Warren Buffett buys UNH. that means insurance could be a hot trade for the next few months. what are you buying?
13F filings just came in and it was disclosed that Warren Buffett has bought 1.5B worth of UNH. not much considering Berkshire's AUM, but he could have added more in the 3rd quarter. though, this wasn't the secret stock that Buffett has been holding back. there still is a mystery 5b+ position undisclosed. So the saga continues.

UNH is up over 11% in premarket as of writing. This bodes extremely well for the health insurance sector, and likely the entire insurance sector overall. Insurance stocks that haven't really seen some love, are likely going to be a hot trade for the next few months.

ROOT insurance is very similar to an early Geico play and trades at a 1.4B mcap. its a tech, ai, & insurance combination so it offers both the alpha and a long term buy and hold prospect. thats my pick.

what insurance stocks are you buying up in this market?
The basis of this thesis makes no sense.

UNH saw its share price crater by more than 60% due to company specific catalysts.

BRK buying UNH doesn’t signal anything about the insurance sector as a whole. It signals that they believed UNH, specifically, would recover/pare its losses. Root is a pump and dump. No one uses root. Everyone on state farm geico allstate etc.
Lmnd is another bs start up variant. Good luck trying to beat the big boys They bought around 0.5% of UNH in shares, or ~$1.5Bn when their cap is now $275Bn (and around 0.4% of BRK cash - which is like a person with a NW of $1M investing $4,000, to put in perspective). This isn't really a massive buy here...

The reaction and UNH going up 10%+ is kind of crazy given the issues UNH has been having along with headwinds due to Medicare changes. it's 0.61% of the portfolio, Buffet didn't buy it Oscr is the one to buy now but what do I know > Legacy is still trying to figure out how to untangle cobol code, before they work on AI & telematics. 

First this isn't really right. There isn't a major insurer out there that hasn't been focusing on telematics & AI for the last decade+... they can't impliment it as cleanly as a new company -- just as is the case in any industry -- but they've definitely been working on it.

Second, all the fancy AI tools & efficiencies only matter so much... Research has shown that pretty much all auto + home insurance business goes to the first few names a person can name off the top of their head which is your all state, geico, liberty mutual, and so on. Pricing is also so highly regulated / competitive that your really only going to get an advantage by going down, aka giving up money, to seem more appealing, but again, notoriety has shown to be much more impactful for converting a policy than price in general has. 

Lemonade has been around for a decade and doing the same thing as Root, but has still only just crossed the $1b written premium mark... Liberty Mutual for example, has ~$24b in written premium for personal lines only.

1mquuhp,2025-08-15,"Watching Rheinmetall Ahead of Trump–Putin Summit
Rheinmetall dipped today, even though there’s no major negative news. With the Trump–Putin summit happening tonight in Alaska, the market could react to any announcements or signals from the leaders.

The company still has:

\- A strong order book (\~€63.2B)

\- Full-year 2025 revenue guidance of 25–30% growth

\- Significant European defense spending, especially in Germany

Could tonight’s summit trigger a short-term rebound on monday in defense stocks like Rheinmetall?
Even if there is a ‘temporary’ peace, both sides are going to be spending to arm themselves and all their allies to the teeth in order to prep for the next conflict a few years down the road. It would probably be cheaper to continue the conflict now and exhaust Russia than to pause and let everyone rearm. So, in a way, a truce has more upside for the stock than continued conflict… EUAD, the EU defense ETF which has Rheinmetall as its third largest asset, is down 4%!!! I plan on buying a lot more because even if there is a truce, EU countries (especially Germany and France) will continue to pump money into their defense. 

I don’t know if there’ll be a short term rebound, but companies like Rheinmetall or Airbus would be long-term holds in my opinion and I’d take advantage of this dip to open a position (or DCA an existing position). Spot on. Peace talks actually mean both sides go shopping for new toys. Russia will rebuild their depleted stocks, and NATO countries will keep pumping cash into defense. Rheinmetall benefits either way. That order book isn't shrinking anytime soon. I doubt much is going to come from the meeting. The media propaganda has been epic and I wouldn't pay it any attention. Try to find what trump and putin are saying themselves not whats regurgitated vomit too you by the media TLDR both have said they have low expectations and no deals are being made for the meeting and many things are being discussed not just ukraine.

If theres any big annoucements know what its going to be about? Not about ukraine but about new START treaty stuff.

With that being said I would sell rheinmetal tbh all of it. Especially if you got in before 2022. A end to the war and the stock will plummet However on the very short term, if there will be a truce, rheinmetall may have a bit of a drop initially because of a potential peacedeal in the future. 

On the long term I think this stock is solid, on the short term I think the chances of a useless meeting tonight are pretty large. The stock may rebound on monday. The orderbook from rheinmetall are full and growing! A peace deal would not make a big impact. Probably a small dip wich would be filled immidiatly! Also a deal with trump is worth nothing and everybody knows that! The eu is arming themself against the usa as well, with trump in the white house rheinmetall will grow fast! DFEN (Vaneck Defense) is down only 1.5% today, it’s not that bad. >EU countries (especially Germany and France) will continue to pump money into their defense. 

I bet that as soon as there's anything remotely resembling a cease-fire, EU countries will scramble to be the first ones to cancel further defense spending and sell a lot of the equipment they just bought. At least I know that's how my government has always operated. Yeah, EUAD also trimmed some of the loses. Only down 0.5% now. peace will make rehinmetall even more valuable since russia would have time to accumulate forces, having a war time industry already ongoing. nothing comparable on our side unless massive investments.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Let me guess. Good retail sales = economy strong, so we pump. Bad retail sales = rate cut incoming, so we pump. Joe Kernen continuing to be a disgrace to CNBC.

He’s screaming sanewash nonsense about how it’s totally normal for a President to manipulate stocks and use the treasury to buy companies, with or without congressional approval.  When politely challenged, he’s doing a weird and creepy pantomime of lighting his “hair” on fire and yelling about DEI hires.

CNBC cannot be taken seriously while he’s still their face. Barclays said Friday that recent U.S. jobs numbers are unlikely to change Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s cautious approach on rates, despite markets betting on a September cut. The bank expects only one 25bp cut in December and thinks investors are overly confident about a September move, misreading the Fed’s view of labor market strength.

So its not only redditors with this opinion It wouldn’t take a genius to think UHC was undervalued by the market. I firmly believe that the ""everything is expensive"" crowd just doesn't look at enough names. 

OPRA: rule of 40 web browser trading at 16.5x earnings. Also pays a 5% dividend. 

NXT: utility solar isn't as rough as residential, and this gem is trading at 14.7x earnings. 

ODD: cosmetics name with 25%+ annual growth, trading at 22x EV/earnings. 

That's not even counting names with cheap forward earnings like CRMD (6x) or ABL (7x).

Like Peter Lynch, turn over rocks. Now you get it. I always laugh when I hear about the pelosi insider knowledge buying… Nividia Google with a nice breakout. It's been consolidating pretty well. Shoutout to this sub. A lot of people were talking about buying UNH before Buffet/Berkshire bought.

1mqebly,2025-08-14,"AMZN vs GOOGL
Y’all,
I am looking at these and interested in getting in. I believe both of them are undervalued and the tech is still the industry to go and invest. What you all like better? I can split but I would rather just dump everything and focus on one stock. Any thought which one might have a better outlook and why?
just get both.. no one knows which one is better long term If you’re really set on picking just one, think about your risk profile. AMZN is more of a reinvest-everything growth machine, GOOGL is a cash flow monster with steadier growth. Personally, I’d lean GOOGL right now  but splitting the position would remove the need to be “right” on just one bet He saw other people post the exact same thing, that’s why. Easy, Amazon is suppressing their profits through capital expenditure. The moment they pivot and spend less, their stock will easily go in the 300s. With Google, a forward PE of 20 is enough said It is actually a fantastic idea if they are investing to make the company more efficient and investing into new sectors so I completely disagree with your premise What makes you believe they are undervalued?  What analysis did you use to draw that conclusion?  Genuinely curious. GOOG is the better call at this point.

1. Stronger consumer-facing AI ecosystem: Owns most of the consumer platforms like Search, YouTube, Android, and Gmail, where AI integration can directly drive engagement and monetization. These touchpoints give it a massive data advantage to improve AI products and ad targeting.
2. Attractive valuation relative to growth potential: Currently valued lower than Amazon, largely due to perceived risks from AI-driven search disruption—risks that are overstated given early evidence of AI-enhanced search boosting engagement.
3. AI as a search growth catalyst: Generative AI tools like AI Overviews in Search are already increasing query volume and user stickiness. As AI improves the search experience, it could expand total search traffic beyond current estimates, driving higher ad revenue.
4. Regulatory overhang likely to ease: While regulatory scrutiny is a headline risk, history suggests these issues tend to resolve without materially harming core business economics.

1mqc5zj,2025-08-14,"Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reveals new stake in beleaguered insurer UnitedHealth
https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/14/warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-unh.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.CopyToPasteboard

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway revealed a new stake in troubled insurer UnitedHealth after secretly building the position for two quarters in a row, according to a regulatory filing.

The Omaha-based conglomerate bought more than 5 million shares in the health care firm for a stake worth about $1.6 billion at the end of June. The size is relatively small for Berkshire, whose equity portfolio is worth about $300 billion, so it could be the work of Buffett’s two investing lieutenants Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.

There was much speculation about the mystery position before Thursday with many guessing it would be a defense name. The confidential treatment allowed Berkshire to quietly build up a position and limit price movement without stoking volatility.


Someone in this subreddit called it. They were super confident but most people wrote them off 😂 i wish i could find the post/comment Buffett doesnt make $1.6B sized investments. This was 100% Todd or Ted. I saw people with like 30 downvotes because they suggested UNH.. 

I am curious what the naysayers are thinking now Hey guys i wonder if the new mystery stock Buffett has been accumulating could be UNH?

""Buffett wouldnt buy that garbage company, he sold it in 2010 for a reason""

Buffett reveals he bought 5 million shares

UNH price rockets 10% in aftermarket trading

""ARE YOU F-CKING KIDDING ME??""

Lol. The shorts are in absolute shambles 🤣 There was never a doubt in my mind that UNH is going to rebound. But… it really does feel like dirty money to me. I’ve talked to people who have had countless things denied by UNH, like a routine screening colonoscopy recommended at age 45 by all the major health experts in the US (USPSTF, American Cancer Society, etc) because it was seen by UNH as merely a “suggested” practice and not standard of care. All the while colon cancer is becoming more prevalent in younger and younger patients. There are a ton of ways to make money in this world. Denying someone their healthcare as an health insurance company (which is the whole reason why you exist in the first place) just to please your shareholders is just fucked up in so many ways. There will be a special place in hell for the board of UNH.

But I guess who cares anymore. We put an antivaxxer as the US health secretary all so we can appeal to a voter base that wants to maintain current tax cuts a little longer and so we could get SALT deductions that phase out anyways after a certain MAGI. So worth the extra $10k I saved in taxes. >I saw people with like 30 downvotes because they suggested UNH..

Absolutely normal behavior for this subreddit when you try and go against any sort of groupthink. My LEAP UNH calls are saved. Thank you Papa Buffet.

Here we are a week out from the big drop and this stock hasnt had any strength.  Im one to love to catch knifes but this one's sliced so hard I needed to drop it.

Not only did we see that their losing a potential marketing war with amazon meta etc.. We see that with much lower growth next qtr (14%). 

To add salt to the wounds this morn news came out that Walmart is starting to open their doors to competition, retracting from being all in with TTD.  Alot of analysts cut their targets last week to 40-55 range. I see why now.

This one may be the stock that destroys accounts. From 90 to 50 and still dropping. Maybe it settles in low 40s or even taps 30s if a market downturn starts to happen as marketing spend will surely be cut.

Sp500 adding them last quarter looks purely like dumping shares into passive investors holding the bag lol [deleted] They actually have strict criteria It’s wiped out 50% of my 1yr profits.
But I’m fucking stupid I was up 50% last week. 
I never sell anything. Ah the R word strikes again. Whenever we see a company gets hammered 50-60% people instantly think about recession, bankruptcy, and etc. 

One thing I learned about investing is strike when there is max fear. But there is a caveat to this, only if they have a healthy balance sheet and is generating + cash flow.

TTD is a great company. It may drop below 50 but has a strong support level at 42.50. That’s where I would add more to my position or sell puts. 

I get the saying that it’s expensive but people are acting like this company is dying. It is certainly not dying.

TTD is not a meme stock. It trades at a high premium because it’s a good company. 

If you vision is long term this company is a good investment. Hold long term. It'll be fine. I added to my roth.

Also, it's way oversold at this point. Down 50%.

The move came just months after the fund dramatically boosted its Alibaba stake in the first quarter by more than 3,360% to $748.4 million from $21.6 million.

The retreat coincided with renewed tariff tensions between Washington and Beijing. On Monday, the two governments extended their trade truce by 90 days, narrowly averting a tariff hike.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order pausing new duties until November 10, while China reciprocated, keeping existing tariffs, 30% on Chinese imports to the U.S. and 10% on U.S. goods to China, in place. The extension, following earlier threats of duties above 100%, temporarily cools a dispute that had intensified earlier this year.

The hedge fund shifted capital into U.S. tech stocks, raising its Nvidia 

NVDA
+0.30%
stake by 154% to 4.61% of its portfolio, and significantly boosting holdings in Microsoft

MSFT
+0.53%
 (+112%), Alphabet

GOOGL
+0.09%
 (+84%), and Meta Platforms 

META
+0.10%
 (+90%), SCMP reported on Thursday.

As of June 30, Bridgewater disclosed 585 positions worth $24.8 billion in public equities, up from $21.6 billion in the first quarter.

Interesting timing with the Chinese economy seemingly finally entering a recovery. I guess the threat of tariff negotiations going poorly was too much to risk for them. Personally, I've been buying Chinese equities since Q3 of 2024 and has worked out well so far. Trump will probably taco again with China and any clarity on the situation there will probably be bullish Time to go long China.  Dalio will make some nice videos now about why China is screwed. Actually, he fully quit the fund in July!

https://www.hedgeweek.com/bridgewater-founder-dalio-fully-exits-hedge-fund-giant/ Dalio fears the TACO. Chinese economy is finally entering a recovery? What metrics are you looking at? First half 2025 GDP exceeded expectations. Some data has remained soft while other data has been improving. I'm not going to give a full breakdown here, you can look for yourself, but it is has definitely improved since the worst of the downturn of the past few years. Their economy is neither booming nor declining as some outlets would have you believe.

Overall, the situation is improving at a moderate pace, with some areas improving faster (retail sales grew 6.4% YoY in May), and some stalling (real estate is still an issue) Your fed article only says China has been growing at a rapid pace but nothing about its current numbers. You are naive to believe the numbers released by the gov so I was just treating you as such. 

China is definitely not growing currently, it can be felt by everyday participants in the Chinese economy. I’m not listening to the propaganda from the west on China cause I’m Chinese, I go back to China regularly and I get first hand info. I don’t need to rely on what western media outlets are reporting on China in English.

1mpypdt,2025-08-14,"Bill ackman is looking to make a 1-3B acquisition and it can be announced soon. Any guesses?
on a recent CC Bill Ackman for HHH mentioned that he was looking to acquire a 1-3B+ insurance co following the model of Warren Buffett. 

It is expected that an announcement can happen anytime soon/weeks prior to his annual meeting on Sep 30.

the reason why Warren outperforms the market & loves insurance, is because insurers reinvests their profits. For Warren & Geico, they rolled their profits & reinvest into equity, which allows them to make outsized returns. Bill Ackman wants to replicate this success.

  
Based on his vision, a P&C insurer is his most likely choice, as reserve requirements are low which allows for reinvestment and it also follows the Geico playbook pretty well.

LMND mcap is too high, HIPO mcap is too small & unprofitable, ROOT makes sense(1.42B) but management has always mentioned that they wanted to grow ROOT to be larger than PGR, so that is likely out of the pic, as ROOT takes the solo approach.

I do not see Bill investing in health insurance due to his past criticism of UNH. Nor is he investing in life insurance due to the higher reserve requirements. Speciality insurance is also too niched with less TAM. Also many MGA's have terrible balance sheets with negative tangible equity (GSHD, RYAN, TWFG, etc)

Any guesses on what it could be or will he make a play on the insuretechs ROOT, HIPO, LMND?
Fuck Bill Ackman. I'm still angry about PSTH How about him forcing Harvard to ban students for protesting or telling his lawyer firm buddies [not to hire those students](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2023/10/10/billionaire-ackman-others-pledge-they-wont-hire-harvard-students-who-signed-letter-criticizing-israel/) or forcing the Dean to resign for 'plagerism' while his wife [got caught plagiarizing](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/04/business/bill-ackman-wife-plagiarism) herself? He is such a chode. herbalife ltd. Isn’t he the same guy that went all over town advocating for a shut down during COVID while he was shorting the market? I started buying UNH when I saw bill criticise them lmao we will never forget If All these guys keep buying  up and consolidating insurance companies we are fucked even more .

I imagine a monthly conference call of all the health and home company ceos of them going “ let’s hike

It’s not about wanting stocks to go up or down, it’s about finding some logic to what’s going on in the market. If you don’t understand what’s going on as an investor, might as well go to a casino and put everything on red. idk if its just maga brainrot but the amount of people here yesterday who were screaming ""THE FED HAS TO CUT RATES ITS FINE WE CAN AFFORD A 25 BASIS POINT CUT THE JOBS ARE SO BAD THEY MUST CUT. THERE WILL BE SO MANY DISSENTS NEXT MEETING.""

smfh Watch we're gonna end the day green cause nothing matters or means anything anymore.. Remember that Donald cut CHIPS Act funding a couple months ago due to “waste and abuse”, saving about ~$4bn of unspent funds. 

Now he’s gonna spend $10bn bailing out the most capital inefficient corporation in the USA. In line CPI : Market moons 1.5%

Disastrous PPI: Market drops 0.3%

Folks, we have a melt up Peter Navarro just makes up all kinds of crap when he gets in front of the camera. ""zero inflation, exporters are eating the costs of the tariffs, multinational corporations are the problem"" what a fucking moron Curious why you think 0.9% m/m isnt that bad? Thats double digits annualized >BREAKING: Beyond Meat, $BYND, headed to Chapter 11 bankruptcy, per the Street

Now there's a name I've not heard or thought about in 5 years I sold my UNH $275 calls for $550.

As companies like Amazon and Microsoft lay off workers and embrace A.I. coding tools, computer science graduates say they’re struggling to land tech jobs.

Definitely speaks to tech companies and non-technical businesses being able to capture massive employee cost efficiency going forward. 

AI centric companies so get profit flow as infuriating industries continue to shed high paying white collar jobs abs watch this savings fall right to the bottom line. 

Bullish for NVDA and all the Ai semi cohorts and Mag 7.

[deleted] Would much rather have a cushy $165k job in tech than be forced to launch a startup after college with no money lol when your article is from the NY post and it uses a tiktok as a reference, not worth a click No, real human. Puts on human. AI can do better. u/bot-sleuth-bot Someone at work called AI ""democratizing"" the other day. That basically means that one day 10 people with high-paying tech jobs are going to be replaced by one low-paid outsourcer using AI. So, anyway, calls. Need money to trade 😔 So you're saying you're broke right now No, the jobs aren’t there. 

Stock prices aside, tech hiring has been contracting in a big way for almost 18 months now. Early-career SE jobs basically evaporated and haven’t come back. 

The automation premise makes sense for now but in a few years (especially as old heads leave the industry to escape “hard tech”) the industry is going to have a significant pipeline problem for SSEs who are currently the ones checking / correcting the AI’s code. It could come back and bite tech in the ass if suddenly the price for an SSE to correct the code ChatGPT copied off of GitHub is way higher than it is today because of a talent shortage. 

That said my personal opinion (from being in tech for 15+ years) is that the pendulum will swing back in the other direction and junior SE roles will open back up in the future. Maybe not to the same extent as before, but they’ll be there. Tech has always been super trendy and it wouldn’t be the first time that everyone dogpiled onto a new idea and then pulled back when reality set in. College costs too much money.

[removed] This is the type of brain dead commentary I expect on r/stocks. Fed hikes rates because crude prices… good god. I think everyone in this sub would do well to remember that you can be concerned about the state of the market and economic condition of the U.S., and still be invested, rooting for the market and enjoying green days. We don’t have to pick between being all in on the market momentum or being all cash under the mattress and hoping for apocalypse This thread has turned into Farris's economics blog September cut now 100% priced in, meaning investors give zero % chance of not cutting. Bonds booming, stocks booming, bear tears running. If you want to bet against this, you can make a lot of money shorting Fed funds futures. You're not impressed with a crypto exchange called Bullish, headquartered in the Cayman Islands, IPOing above the expected range at a $4.4B valuation on revenues of $158MM?

1moreah,2025-08-13,"Seeing a lot of hate for AMZN lately
Ads up 23% yoy (high margin) 15.7 billion last quarter alone equaling a third the size of meta. AWS still beat expectations although not as much as the competitors (important to remember it’s significantly larger but I still would’ve liked to see 20% growth instead of 17%). Subs grew 12%, e-commerce growth reaccelerated to 11% growth. North American e-commerce operating income was up 50% y/y to 7.5 billion and international profits up 5x to 1.5 billion. E-commerce which was previously unprofitable generated almost as much profit as all of AWS and only going to increase with the use of robotics. Company is reinvesting every penny back into the business (32 billion in operating cash flow, 32 billion in capex). Grew eps 33% y/y and currently trading for 33x trailing so peg ratio is 1. Thoughts?
CEO will blame everyone but himself for their stock going down. I don’t think he’s a good fit. But the company is performing ok regardless Honestly AMZN’s fundamentals look strong 23% ad growth, AWS still growing solidly, and e-commerce finally profitable with huge margins. They’re reinvesting heavily and 33% EPS growth with a PEG around 1 feels pretty fair. The hate seems overblown given the numbers It is mean reversion. The company traded at high PE for a decade and is now through its Balmer era. I guess it will imporve once they put Jassy in PIP :D Would have to be a cold day in hell before I bet against Amazon That’s my question too. He’s not taking accountability because there’s nothing to be held accountable for. Amazon is doing well by all accounts; the stock is down because of sentiment, not the company’s performance Bezos is more focused on selling his Amazon stock and getting his plastic wife a slot in the new James Bond movie than finding a better CEO and being an active chairman. Jassy is consistently mediocre, but it will take another few years of underperformance until he gets taken out. Amazon isn’t doing poorly, they are just not doing as well as they could. What exactly did the CEO do make the stock price go down? agree, leadership accountability is pretty rare these days. At least the fundamentals seem solid even if the messaging isn't great Amazon has underperformed spy over the past 5 years. I own the stock and lots of it.

1mohbkg,2025-08-12,"I just sold a decent amount of stock..
32, $890k networth, I decided to be a little manic and sell a good amount of stock today. 

I sold: 

APLD +70%

NBIS +90%

ALAB +150%

RDDT +90%

ONDS +100%

SMCI +10% (small position)

That now puts me at 32% cash, not sure why I'm sharing, just thought I would, I see a lot of repetitive information on here, so I thought I would share something new. 

I also started a position in Dow Chemical, just 100 shares, but yeah

I thought about selling some $HOOD and possibly my $META position, but I've always told myself that those are my lifers, so not sure if I will or not. Might sell some $HOOD tomorrow if it pops when they release their July numbers. 

The list above were all stocks that I sold today. 

Within the last 3 months I've sold

$QQQ +60%

$ARKW +120%

$NVDA +270%

$VRT +40%

$AAPL +40%

Those are slight approximations, I hate how Fidelity doesn't show you the total gain on closed positions, but yeah. 

Not sure what I'll do with the cash, moved most of it to $SGOV, so $175k in $SGOV, 25k in Fidelity that I will slowly buy positions with and then like $87k in Robinhood cash position.


Thanks for the detailed portfolio update. Should we expect your tax return next? Imagine taking profits The only time you realize a gain or loss is when you sell. Not sure why you’re getting any slack, but you’re never wrong for taking profit in individual stocks. They are high risk and hats off on some nice gains.

I don’t understand why people sell market funds/ETFs other than routine reallocation though.

Enjoy that tax bill though lol, that’ll be the real gut punch. $94k short term gains, $61k long term gains in Fidelity, then probably another $30k or so in Robinhood short term gains. Imagine going to cash during a never ending pump.

1moen3c,2025-08-12,"Best stocks to bet against if you are bearish on AI.
Aside from the obvious ones like NVDA, MSFT, META, which tickers would be suitable for shorting or buying puts on, if you are bearish on AI and believe we are in a bubble akin to the dot-com boom?

I see that there are two general categories companies can be placed into:

1. Those which actually provide some kind of AI infrastructure/software that other companies are using and paying for. NVDA, MSFT, META are the obvious ones. But this would also include companies like INOD which provide data labeling services that MSFT/META/etc pay for; or data center/chip related companies like APLD, NVTS, SITM

2. Companies which are simply ""using"" AI in some capacity, which may be providing actual value or may be just a gimmick to increase their stock price. For example SOUN, BBAI, CRNC, PYH, ICAD, DUOT.

If you wanted to take a conservative bearish position, I think the best way to do it would be to identify those companies in #2 whose core value proposition does not include AI but who are merely claiming to use AI to ride the AI hype train. However this might be hard to do.

A moderate bearish position would be to short/buy puts on all companies in #2.

A true bearish position would be to short all companies in #1.

---

Which companies would you bet against if you were bearish on AI?

edit: I have no open positions and am merely thinking through the opportunities.
I think AI is overhyped and could be a bubble, but there's no way I'd short it. The market can stay irrational way longer than you can stay solvent. Why not just build a little fire and throw your money on it instead? you should totally try it dude. please let me know how it goes. It’s absolutely not over hyped, maybe just a bit early. The future is pretty clear where it is heading and once AI develops more it can start developing itself for rapid advancements This post is hilarious. Aside from the obvious futility of trying to timing the pop of the bubble there’s another layer that is prevalent here on Reddit - the total lack of understanding of what AI is, and most of all, why there is a bubble and how will the market behave once it finally pops. It’s like traveling back in time back to dotcom bubble and reading someone being bearish on the internet. So as another redditor concisely put it, save yourself the headache and just light your money on fire. I haven’t been saying anything, but I do work with AI in my career. I am aware of it’s flaws but it absolutely does help in some areas and as it improves (with every company pushing it they will train better models faster and faster) it will improve efficiency. 

It’s like saying the internet was overhyped. Maybe it didn’t become what everyone saw coming right away but the train was in motion and not stopping. 

Same with AI it is going to get there. And while it is it is improving processes all over the world Literally all of the smartest tech people in the world, all having inside knowledge of AI progress and projects, are bullish on AI, and you choose to be bearish? Seems very silly. I remember being an excited little teenager back in the late 90s or something when I illegally listened to music I downloaded from the internet on Winamp and visiting my friends geocities page and signing their guestbook. (so long ago i might have gotten those names wrong)

I feel like that excited teenager about AI at \~40.

You're absolutely right about AI - it's early - but it's not overhyped. yeah but then you'll just be known as an idiot who burns money. This way you get to call yourself an investor.

1mocvvv,2025-08-12,"Perplexity Makes Longshot $34.5 Billion Offer for Chrome
From The Wall Street Journal.

>Perplexity’s offer is significantly more than its own valuation, which is estimated at $18 billion. The company told The Wall Street Journal that several investors including large venture-capital funds had agreed to back the transaction in full.

>Estimates of Chrome’s enterprise value vary widely but recent ones have ranged from $20 billion to $50 billion.

I would think that the valuation would be worth even more, this is probably just an opening salvo.

Google pays Apple approximately $20 billion per year to remain the default search engine on Apple devices, including the Safari browser on iPhones, iPads, and Macs. The anti-trust ruling might force Google to spin off Chrome, but Google will likely appeal any decision, so this is going to be stuck in court for a long time. I'm not sure what this offer achieves but Perplexity has a lot of guts going for it.
This is truly clown behavior.  I imagine Google would wipe its ass with this offer lol Seriously. Google pay more money to Apple a year via Chrome, then Perplexity is even worth (which is a ridiculous valuation anyways l). 

All these AI companies are just going to end up getting bought out by one of the big LLMs in the next 4-5 years anyways. Perplexity took the phrase 'fake it till you make it' way too seriously. A bunch of clowns in a circus. Did the same shit with TikTok earlier this year. They’re making unserious bullshit offers as a way to raise their profile, and the morons in finance journalism are giving them exactly what they want.    Except perplexity. Nobody gonna buy perplexity. It’s just a business venture to help the ceo get a green card and say he worked in ai. Google is worth $2.5 Trillion

Yes, they will wipe their ass with this offer. I submit the bid for $34.6B IMO it’s a stunt to distract people from the fact that they’re an official partner of Trump’s social media platform Eh not really. A judge is considering divestment from Chrome as a possible antitrust remedy. By making an unsolicited bid, Perplexity is signaling to the judge there is a market for the asset if that’s the route he wants to take. 

I think it’s more about perplexity trying to undermine Google than a pure intentioned acquisition offer from them.  Which is, y’know, definitely in Perplexity’s best interest.

Warren Buffett has been building a position on a secret stock for a while now and could disclose their secret stock with their 13F filings later this week. 

would it be something in the insurance sector, consumer staples or something else? Previously his secret stock was chubb.

i see alot of talk about UNH but i highly doubt it, and i also doubt it is ROOT insurance. though ROOT seems to be similar to his purchase to Geico in 1976.

GameStop, he thinks it’s gonna squeeze UPS or FedEx are my expectations.

They are beaten down, profitable and predictable companies, which have few competitors at that scale. Lol just imagine. This market would become shitshow Goog he already admitted that they messed up not investing in it before. Rklb $8.8 Billion in cash, $600 million in crypto holdings, is cash flow positive by about $160 million (compared to -$370 million a few years ago.)

Wouldn't be such a bad holding. If there was ever an opportunity for Warren to dip his toes into the emergence of AI at a reasonable valuation it was this past year in GOOG.  Undervalued for most of the year and multiple diverse streams of revenue.  I think the PE got down to 10 or 11 at one point.  And its had a hell of a run lately.

Remember it was Abel who was the key to the AAPL and AMZN purchases. $HOG NVO (Novo Nordisk). Large cash pile, very low (near zero) debt. Pays a dividend I really think UPS may be the one.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

1mny9at,2025-08-12,"GOOGL is a value buy due to AI
Yes, this is your weekly Google post!

Google, the company that made LLMs possible with the transformer revolutionary paper. The company that has been valued at 20 PE for many quarters now, even though its peers are at 30ish PE.

LLMs have hit a plateau. Incremental model versions (GPT 5 for example) are not showing incremental gains. If anything, new versions are kind of acting funny as more and more non-LLM characteristics are being added to them to be able to give a deterministic response (how many Rs in a strawberry🍓). We never actually solved “intelligence”, with LLMs, we got a great mimicking machine. So now, LLMs are peaking without the true intelligence (it’s impossible for LLMs with the current science to be truly intelligent).

Guess what improved a shit ton while having billions of daily active users - yes, Google. They integrated LLMs in all their products, although a little slowly. Every product improved, and yet the stock remained in a value territory. They beat every earnings report, give great guidance, hit past the total queries on Google, and still the stock is not as loved as other big tech. They also have the best LLM IMO, Gemini is great.

Unlike ChatGPT, Google doesn’t depend on NVIDIA or other cloud providers for hardware to run LLMs (this is a huge moat). Allowing it to offer cheap LLMs.

I already own 10k worth of Google, and I’m going to 2x it tomorrow. With almost 40k worth of google by the end of September. 
I've been eyeing Google for the very reason that I don't think the government is going to do much (if anything) to them. 


The insight you provide here is another good reason to buy.  Not to mention Waymo has the capability to be a $100bn+ entity by itself. Have you ever ridden in one? They are the future. I don't like that there is no other guy in the waymo. I wish waymo added a guy in the car so I can talk politics with. They don't have to drive, the car can be self driving, I just want to hear stories from a retired cabby.

I called waymo support and tried to do this and they were very mean saying I should not be wasting tech support time because there are people in need. What about my needs? Eventually they realized they were extra mean and I got a coupon in my email a few days later. But eh. Everytime I have a drink or two and start mouthing off about Alphabet I end up wondering why I don't own more Alphabet. Let’s buy more tomorrow! I own 3500 google and add 20 shares a week. If they see enough demand for this, and have competent managers in their product teams, they can add a feature to chat with a GenAI at additional cost. The tech already exists, and just needs a  bit more engineering to tailor it for that use case. Why does AI make Google a value play? Gemini is likely burning billions of dollars a year with no path to profitability in sight. How is that value? I can argue to date it has been a destruction of value despite the hype it is receiving. Years of safe record and one bad accident is what it will take to erode trust in Tesla. Non-Lidar tech is inferior but cheap. It would be a mistake for a company to prioritize cost over safety when it’s someone’s life. I will bet large money that over a few years, Waymo will come out even more ahead, unless Tesla adds Lidar or other sensors.

Btw, LIDAR tech will be superior when Waymo eventually expands to other countries with not so good road markings etc. Can’t say the same thing about camera based tech. Even if the government goes with the harshest response of mandating a breakup, that’s ironically *also* a good outcome for shareholders.

1mncu1o,2025-08-11,"Why are we so drawn to broken stocks?
Hey everyone, Not sure if it’s just me, but there’s something addictive about seeing a big stock crash and tinking, This is the moment to buy. Right now it’s happening with UNH, and maybe soon LLY. Before that it was Facebook, Netflix… and yeah, people who bought the bottom there made a ton of money.
But honestly? There are way more stories about stocks that broke and never came back. Nobody remembers those  after COVID there were loads of them.
So the question is  how do you even know if it’s a golden opportunity or a business that’s done for good? In a down market, sometimes it’s just a beta thing  a stock with high beta will drop twice as much as the index, and that says nothing about the actual business. In an up market? That’s different. Sometimes it’s a real warning sign.
Example CrowdStrike  anyone with basic IT knowledge knew it wasn’t “game over” for them, just a one-off issue. But with something like UNH, I honestly can’t tell if it’s just a dip or a break that won’t recover.

One more thing  personally I don’t think you can build real wealth by buying “cheap” stocks. Sure, it can work as a small slice of your portfolio, but if it’s your main strateg you’ll probably have a lot of green days in the market while your portfolio stays red.
What do you think
Recency bias, gamblers fallacy, disposition effect and could even be confirmation bias.


Recency bias in that people think the recent higher valuation had merit, so should still be worth similar.


Gamblers fallacy in that if it keeps going down it has to go up eventually.


Disposition effect for people not wanting to realize a loss and holding on to a loser too long.


Confirmation bias is remembering times when there was a big drop that recovered while forgetting about the many others that never recovered. There's a big difference between broken stocks and broken businesses. If you possess the ability to distinguish between the 2 and you aren't influenced by emotions of the market, you will make money in the long run. Because sometimes great companies fall and it creates a buying opportunity. Facebook in 2022 was a great example There’s always a bunch of random reasons given whenever this happens… when FB fell last time people on Reddit had all sorts of theories why FB wasn’t actually undervalued, their apps suck etc etc

What you’re saying right now is no different tbh. A huge drop feels like a sale tag in neon lights. If a stock was $500 yesterday and it’s $350 today, some people instinct is to think: If it just goes back to where it was, that’s an easy 40% gain! The problem is, that thinking assumes the old price was justified and that whatever caused the drop is temporary. Buying blue chip companies cheap (from a true fundamental view, not just stock went down view) is probably the most reliable way to build long term wealth outside of just indexing. You see so much talk about UNH, like the others you mention, because it’s an embedded leader in an absolute massive segment. Buying a drop on UNH is significantly different than buying a drop on Vivid Seats. 
 I remember reading a Wall Street Journal piece that looked at this from 2000 onwards if at the end of each year you bought the 20 worst-performing stocks of that year, each with a 5% allocation, the strategy’s total return over 25 years was -98% : the times when buying the dip didn’t work out, nobody seems to remember Just buy the dip.

1mmyick,2025-08-11,"Nextdoor - NXDR: The Next Local Platform Breakout & Why Reddit Buying it Makes Sense
Nextdoor is a hyperlocal social platform sitting at the intersection of community trust, local commerce, and utility. After years of underperformance, it’s in the middle of a *major product relaunch* that’s already driving better engagement and beating revenue estimates. With a market cap under $1B (\~3× revenue), there are multiple untapped monetization levers, and real strategic appeal to larger players (think Reddit, Facebook Marketplace, even Groupon style business lines). The turnaround is just beginning.

# Quick snapshot

* **Market cap:** \~$0.7–0.8B (smallcap, sub $1B).
* **Recent Q2 2025 revenue:** Nextdoor beat consensus (Q2 revenue ≈$65M) and reported improving engagement metrics. Management relaunched the app in July 2025 (big redesign & product pivot).
* **“The new Nextdoor”** (launched July 2025) focuses on Alerts, News, and Faves (AI recommendations + local publisher content), built to make Nextdoor *useful daily* rather than just a social feed.
* **Revenue (approx):** \~$240–250M (implied by recent results / public data). That puts current market cap at roughly \~3x revenue (very rough math).

# Bull case

1. **Founder/leadership momentum.** Nextdoor just rolled out “the new Nextdoor”, a material redesign that emphasizes *Alerts, News, and Faves* (AI recommendations, safety alerts, local news integration). The company is explicitly trying to move from underused UGC feed to a utility-first hyperlocal product. Q2 2025 showed revenue above Street estimates and management reported user engagement gains. That’s the classic early signal: product changes leading to higher engagement leading to more ad inventory and better local targeting. If the relaunch sustains engagement lifts, top line acceleration could follow.
2. **Hyperlocal moat trust & utility.** Facebook/Reddit are broad; Nextdoor owns neighborhood context (addresses/neighborhood boundaries, local public agencies, homeowners groups) and is integrating local news and authoritative alerts (police, utilities, weather). That makes it sticky for time sensitive local information, something Facebook Marketplace can’t fully replicate in a trust/utility sense.
3. **Multiple, under monetized local monetization levers.**
   * **Local ads** (SMBs, local chains, political/municipal buys).
   * **For sale / classifieds & marketplace** (native commerce, transaction take rates or promoted listings).
   * **Public sector / emergency alert contracts** (municipal subscriptions or paid integrations). The relaunch and better engagement can multiply ARPU without needing a full blown global ad sales machine. Q2 showed revenue growth and the company is still far from saturating local ad dollars.
4. **Low current valuation implies big upside for execution.** At \~$0.7–0.8B market cap on \~$240–250M revenue, Nextdoor trades at low revenue multiples (\~3x). If the product relaunch meaningfully improves revenue growth rate and margin profile, multiples could rerate toward higher comps (local ad / classifieds peers), giving sizable upside.
5. **Strategic optionality / M&A interest is plausible.** A hyperlocal network with community trust and data is interesting to players looking to fill local gaps: Reddit (community + local expansion), local classifieds / commerce players, or even retail/media acquirers. Being small cap makes it an easier acquisition target if the relaunch proves momentum. (I’ll expand on Reddit below.)
6. **Playbook borrowable from Groupon/local deals.** Nextdoor already has ""for sale & free"" and local business relationships. Adding structured local offers, time-limited promos, or merchant subscriptions (Groupon style vouchers, merchant promos, or subscription local deals) is a relatively straightforward product and revenue lift. Groupon’s continued local billings show the market still exists; Nextdoor could capture a portion by adding deals and integrating them into neighborhood flows and “Faves” recommendations.

**Catalysts to watch (bull triggers):**

* Sustained weekly/monthly active user growth and time on app after the relaunch.
* ARPU increase in upcoming quarters (ads + local commerce monetization).
* New paid partnerships with municipalities or publishers that create recurring revenue.

# Why Reddit buying Nextdoor could make sense

* **Why it’s logical:** Reddit wants to deepen “real world” community ties and monetize local advertiser demand; Nextdoor brings verified local neighborhoods, public safety integrations, and local ad inventory. Combining Reddit’s community driven content and ad products with Nextdoor’s local reach creates synergies: better local commerce, events, and localized Reddit communities with verified local utility.
* **Why it might not happen:** Reddit could easily build this themselves and one could argue that the subreddits already achieve the main functionality of Nextdoor without needing a seperate app or community.

# Facebook Marketplace Comparison

* Facebook Marketplace is massive and already accounts for huge listing volume and buyer traffic globally (hundreds of millions of users). Meta can bundle marketplace commerce and ad targeting more cheaply than a small competitor. **But** Marketplace is a horizontal player. Nextdoor’s advantage is *hyperlocal trust, neighborhood boundaries, and municipal/publisher relationships*. If Nextdoor nails utility (alerts, local news, verified neighbor recommendations, Faves), it retains defensibility even in the face of Facebook. Think: users who rely on the app for safety and local official alerts may prefer Nextdoor even if they sell on Marketplace.

# How Nextdoor can easily incorporate Groupon like features

* **Merchant dashboard + deals API:** let local merchants create time limited promos, featured deals in neighborhood feeds, or “welcome offers” for neighbors.
* **Promoted merchant cards:** place deals inside the “Faves” recommendation flow and local alerts.
* **Local vouchers + merchant payout integration:** low friction deals (digital coupons) with a small platform fee or merchant subscription. This is lowlift product work (existing forsale and business listings are already present); the value is in embedding offers where neighbors are already looking for recommendations (Faves) and in alerts. Groupon’s Q2 shows local deal demand still exists; Nextdoor could capture a healthier margin by focusing on repeat neighborhood customers rather than mass discounting.

# Valuation

* Market cap ≈ **$0.7–0.8B** vs LTM revenue ≈ **$240–250M** → **\~3x revenue**. For a small-cap social with improving engagement and multiple monetization levers, that multiple is low compared to growth comps that trade at higher revenue multiples when showing reliable growth and margin expansion. If Nextdoor can shift growth profile to midteens revenue growth and improve margins via ad monetization & local commerce, multiple expansion plus faster top-line could easily produce doubled (or more) share value.

# Bear case

1. **History of low engagement & moderation headaches.** Nextdoor has historically struggled with low daily active usage vs registered users and with content quality / moderation issues (which depress advertiser demand). If relaunch fails to fix these, advertisers may be slow to return.
2. **Burn & structural losses / tight balance sheet.** The company is still losing money (GAAP net losses and sizable stock comp / restructuring historically). If growth proves expensive or ad demand weakens, cash burn could force equity raises that dilute shareholders or constrain investment. Q2 numbers still showed negative adjusted EBITDA (though improved).
3. **Big competitors with scale and marketplace traction.** Meta’s Facebook Marketplace has enormous user reach and listing depth; Meta can bundle marketplace commerce with ad targeting at scale. If Facebook decides to deepen local utility + community features, Nextdoor could be outgunned on commerce. Meta’s massive audience and Marketplace stats show a very large TAM that’s hard for a small player to defend against.
4. **Execution risk on product overhaul.** Relaunches often raise expectations. If adoption is slow, or if new features don’t convert to monetizable usage (or create moderation/legal headaches), investors will punish the stock. The market is already skeptical (shares trade near multiyear lows).
5. **Ad market cyclicality & macro risk.** Local ad spend tends to be more cyclical. A broader ad slowdown or a recession could hit Nextdoor hard given its SMB exposure and lower ad pricing power.

# Bottom line / recommendation

* **Bullish case:** Low current valuation, a major product relaunch with clear utility (alerts/local news/AI recommendations), early signs of engagement/revenue improvement, and many undermonetized local revenue levers (ads, local commerce, municipal partnerships). If the relaunch sustains engagement, upside is meaningful.
* **Bearish case:** Execution risk, historical moderation/engagement problems, ongoing losses and potential dilution, and big competitors (Meta’s Marketplace) that can replicate commerce features.
Once you get on nextdoor you can't find the exit fast enough. Nextdoor = did anyone lose a dog/hear those gunshots? Nextdoor is full of Karens.  If you don’t act like a Karen, you get banned. Nextdoor is ASS WHO'S KIDS ARE THESE? Worst god damn social media app. Everybody is either asking if a noise was a gun shot or complaining about people putting dog poop in their trash can on the street. You also left out the most compelling thing which is that they have like 400 million in cash and the market cap is only like 650.

So the company is being valued at pretty much 1X revenue. You often see this in companies where they are burning cash, but they aren’t they’ve been free cash flow positive the last couple quarters.

This is great because downside is fairly limited as long as they can maintain that FCF.  Unfortunately it caps the upside quite a bit though as it will be much harder for this company to go 10X in a year.

Could see 3x though I think. > it’s in the middle of a major product relaunch

Is this why they started spamming me with emails recently?  I signed up once years ago when I moved to a new neighborhood, then forgot about it.  Suddenly in the past week or two they've been sending me random ""breaking news"" emails. nextdoor = where older MAGAs hang around It’s an interesting platform. Just doesn’t have a strong enough story to compel me to give it a second look.

1mmwihz,2025-08-10,"CENTENE (CNC) is a good long term opportunity at this level
Like every self-respecting Value investor, I've been looking for opportunities to divest from my tech-heavy portfolio. AI Stocks like NVDA, PLTR, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA have done great, but some of these valuations just don't make sense and I don't think now is a good time to buy into them anymore.

That brings me to look for other opportunities. I don't think there's a better opportunity right now than the Healthcare sector.

Historically, Healthcare has outperformed the S&P, thanks to relatively stable stocks like CNC.

Let's take a step back. What the f\*%# happened to this stock in the past 2 months ?

They came out and :

1. Said that their Medical Loss Ratio(MLR) will be much higher because claims are getting expensive
2. Pulled guidance for 2025

Since then, they've had their Q2 Earnings call. They've revised guidance to a EPS of 1.75 for 2025 (from 7.5 previously, ouch). Given that their Q1 2025 EPS was 2.9, and their Q2 EPS was -0.16, this is pricing in a combined -1$ EPS for Q3 and Q4.

The bar is very low. Even a small sign of life from the CEO, could send this stock easily back to the 40 - 50 range, as a path to profitability is starting to be priced into the stock.

The recent headwind, albeit very impactful in the short to medium-term, is temporary. the CEO has said that they have already completed rate re-filings in the 29 states by now, and that the rate decision for each states will be expected in September. The new rates that determine the amount of premiums received, will take into account the high cost for behavioral health(therapists, psychiatric meds etc...),  home health services, and expensive drugs (Wegovy, Ozempic...) .

Compared to the giant UNH, CNC has a much better reputation, isn't under DOJ Investigation, and Ambetter, their Health Insurance Marketplace, has a claims denial rate of 14%, more than half that of UNH.

# Path back to profitability :

CEO and the team are now laser focused on restoring profitability by pulling the necessary levers :

\- identifying and reducing areas where claims have been too ""costly""

\- increasing premium rates, to account for the challenging environment, and with a worst case scenario in mind (continued high morbidity and utilization rate)

\- hinting at a stock buyback in the Earnings call

\- Immune from tariff BS and TACO

# Possible risks

\- The trend of high morbidity and drug use continues to escalate, leading to more people needing expensive surgeries and drugs ==> unlikely, as people who fear that their benefits are being taken away with OBBBA, have already stocked up on drugs/done surgeries

\- continued political pressure on healthcare costs with bills like the OBBBA ==> unlikely, as this bill seems to be a one-and-done on healthcare, and now the Administration will focus on other more pressing matters (Russia - Ukraine conflict, Inflation, crypto, tax bills for the rich etc ...).

Also, this is speculation, but I think the full impact of the OBBBA are wayyy overstated. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that by 2034, 16 million people will lose coverage, but that's a decade away. This will be accounted for in the rate re-pricing.

\- Risks of people changing Insurers because of higher rates ==> given that every Health insurer will be increasing rates, among them: Elevance, UNH, Molina, Blue Cross Blue Shield, CNC will be no exception. People won't switch because none of the other options are better. Centene's health plan is pretty competitive, and compared to Molina health who's the most affordable, Centene's has much better coverage(available across 29 states vs 8 for Molina)

Overall, I think this is a compelling buy, not just for CNC, but for the Health care sector overall, as the benefits greatly outweigh the risk at this point. Historically, the Healthcare Sector has outperformed the S&P, and this is the perfect time to buy in.
You should post it in more subreddits s/ If I'm not mistaken Centene relies on Medicaid for over half of their revenue,  Q2 confirmed the lower memberships are hurting margins too. IMO this is just a gamble. Tim Moore, vice chair of a subcommittee investigating fraud, including Medicaid fraud just loaded up on CNC and UNH This has been the first time it was negative. the company hasn't  returned a negative EPS for more than 15 years Take on note that Tim Moore also has been buying this on after falldown. Yes!also she owns a total of 850 000 shares. Selling winners to buy one of the biggest losers that is still a falling knife sounds like a winning strategy Like I said. this is an exceptional situation, and it's fixable.

1mmsr05,2025-08-10,"Exit GOOG/GOOGL or Hold Through Remedies Ruling?
It's my largest position by far and I'm a bit nervous about Department of Justice remedies announcement coming sometime this month.

Thinking of selling 500 or 600 shares and waiting out the month of August until there's clarity around legal headwinds facing the company; then, if it dumps on some harsher than expected verdict (e.g. selling Chrome, forced sharing of search data treasure trove, etc.) get back in at a likely much lower price.

Otherwise, could continue to hold, but it's going to be painful if there's a steep drop coming shortly that everyone knows may happen this month.

Any others with skin in the game have a plan for working around the August announcement? Or maybe it's all priced in and I'm overthinking it, just wait out this particular bump in the road...
I think the remedies decision is the biggest bullish catalyst for Google. Like 90% chance they get slap on the wrist and the anti trust stuff clears. They’ll then get revalued to a PE of rest of the mag 7. So like $300 share price Any ruling is bullish. Clarifies and quantifies risk. If Google is forced to sell chrome I hope they sell it to a company based in China, see how fast the DOJ starts backtracking. This. No way this administration pushes for a harsher outcome; esp. not after all the lobbying work. With the AI race being so important, the admin would be so dumb to break apart Google.

1mm8vt5,2025-08-10,"Companies that have a moat - lock their customers in
I'm doing research on which companies have a moat to add to my portfolio. Especially with growth. Companies that once customers use their services, it's hard for them to leave, and customers then have to pay the companies over and over again. But I also want them to have high growth for higher return. Feel free to agree/ disagree and suggestion. Thanks. 

NVDA: already 60% of my portfolio. Cuda locks customers in hard. If I pick 1 stock to all in, it's NVDA and I have zero worry. Plan to buy more. 

PLTR: not in my portfolio. crazy PE. But this company's softwares run our government. I'm looking to add next week. 

TSM: in my portfolio. The chip manufacturer for the whole world. No one can replace or even compete with it. 

Microsoft: in my portfolio. Windows. Microsoft's cloud, AI data center. ChatGPT. 

Hood: used to be. Sadly I exited at 62 to switch to NVDA. Now it's exploded. Looking to add back. They have stocks/ crypto brokerage, banking, retirement account. I've been using Robinhood since 2017. Tried other apps as well but nothing can compare. I pay for robinhood gold and use their margin. Of all my picks, this one is the most debatable. But personally I just can't stop using this app. 

Meta: not in my portfolio. FB is where all businesses have to use. And they will keep paying for ads over and over again. I know because I am paying them for ads and for the blue ticker monthly. 

Google: in my portfolio. YouTube. Google's cloud and AI data center. 

Apple: in my portfolio. Apple ecosystem.

If I rate these stocks from best to the least best (best is safest), then:
NVDA 
Microsoft 
Google
Apple
Meta
TSM
PLTR
Hood
ASML has probably the biggest moat out of any company 

The entire semiconductor industry including NVDA and TSM are heavily dependent on their lithography machines Good companies and fairly sane assessment. I would reconsider your HOOD bias. They don't have the moat or customer lock in the other companies in your list do. Most major clients with $1 million portfolios and up will almost always go with a serious brokerage from one of the big banks 1) You are describing like 80% of America 

2) If you look at Robinhood right now and said in 10 years they were the largest player in the finance game, I wouldn’t doubt it. 


Just breaking it down, if you’re 18 and looking to start adulthood Robinhood lets you:

Invest in stocks easier than anywhere else 

Has educational articles on crypto, ETFs, etc 

Gives the easiest access to IPOs 

Lets you hold money in your buying power just like a HYSA at 4% APY

Give you a debit card with a FDIC insured bank account that allows direct deposit

Gives cash back on said debit card on groceries and gas

Offers round ups into any stock, fund, crypto, or allows you to just put it into buying power. 

Is offering a credit card soon 

Gives you a traditional or Roth IRA with 3% match 

Is starting to offer home mortgages. 

Say what you want about Robinhood but their grasp on Millennials, GenZ and soon GenA isn’t going anywhere. Seems every other post is a bot these days  It’s a hell of a trick, though. LOL. 

As if what you propose is that easy. Amzn for the same reason you have MSFT. Some massive customers are on AWS and it would be very hard to shift off  So we basically have the Mag-7 here and then two meme stocks. 

Palantir and Robinhood have virtually no moat sorry, until PLTR has a proven track record of being impossible to replicate or offers some feature that nobody else can then they will have a weak moat. 

What about companies like V or MA? How about credit ratings like SPGI, maybe even FICO. Then you have companies like TDG which buy up all competition in aerospace parts. The duopoly of EDA software with CDNS and SNPS.

Nobody seems to look for quality anymore it’s just what’s popular. Some of the choices here are fine, but there are much better moats out there. It isn’t, but I’d confidently park a non-trivial sum of money in Google or Microsoft for 25 years and throw away the keys. Can’t say the same of ASML - particularly as process node size approaches theoretical limits where quantum tunneling effects make downsizing further in the same paradigm non-viable. Don't entirely disagree but it's a moat nonetheless

1mlwaq9,2025-08-09,"Wells Fargo analyst gives TECK $101 price target (It's currently $33.)
Relevant link: [https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/teck-resources-stock-rating-reiterated-at-**overweight-by-wells-fargo-93CH-4179952**](https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/teck-resources-stock-rating-reiterated-at-overweight-by-wells-fargo-93CH-4179952)

**Full disclosure:** I'm a longstanding TECK holder. It's a large part of my port, I recently added some, and I plan to hold it for many years to come. As such, I'm biased and have a lot to gain by seeing it moon.

On the other hand, I think I'm pretty realistic. I have a decent grasp of the challenges TECK is facing and the lack of excitement about mining stocks in general these days. Concerning the latter, capital tends to flow where it can grow fastest, and mining isn't usually the place do to that. Still, I thought I'd bring this recent news to your attention and see what your thoughts are...

**The Bull Case (""You've got to have Fauth"")**  
On August 8, 2025, Wells Fargo analyst Tiago Fauth reiterated his Overweight rating of TECK with a **$101 price target** ([Source](https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/teck-resources-stock-rating-reiterated-at-overweight-by-wells-fargo-93CH-4179952)). TECK closed at $33.03 on that same day. That's a 206% upside. Fauth calls TECK ""one of the most attractive risk/rewards"" in their coverage, arguing the market's skepticism isn't justified. His confidence seems rooted in:

1. **QB2's Potential:** A belief that once fully operational, this massive copper mine in Chile (which Teck has a 60% stake in) will be a major cash flow machine.
2. **Undervaluation:** Seeing TECK trading at a steep discount to peers, which should narrow as QB2 finally ramps up.
3. **Solid Fundamentals:** Noting Teck's strong liquidity (current ratio of 3.47x).

**The Counterweight (""Reality Check"")**  
While I admit that $101 is an exciting number (even if it strikes me as a bit odd) the stock's current price near $33 (down 39% from its 52-week high) and recent analyst moves tell a different story. Here's where my own caution comes in:

1. **QB2 remains the core challenge:** This project has been plagued by delays and cost overruns, and most recently, issues with the tailings management plant and shiploader. In the second quarter, results of which were reported on July 24, copper sales missed expectations, adjusted EBITDA came in slightly below estimates and, critically, Teck had to lower its 2025 production guidance because of ongoing QB2 ramp-up difficultes (e,g, tailings, shiploader). Thus, Fauth's these majorly hinges on QB2 finally hitting its stride smoothly and soon.
2. **Fauth's view is an outlier:** The consensus analyst price target sits between $43 and $44, depending on the source. And recent analyst actions have been cautious:
   * JPMorgan downgraded TECK from Overweight to Neutral.
   * B.Riley moved from Buy to Neutral and cut its target.
   * Benchmark, Jefferies, and Raymond James all reduced their targets (though some kept Buy ratings). The common thread? Concerns about QB2's timeline, execution risks and the impact on near-term performance.
3. **Macro Headwinds Persist:** China's struggling property sector (a huge copper consumer) continues to weigh on demand sentiment. Global growth remains uncertain and copper prices are inherently volatile.

**My Take as a Shareholder:**  
I own TECK because I believe in the long-term copper story (though it does tend to get overhyped at times), and QB2's *potential*. While I can't say I have as much faith as Fauth --a $101 price target seems a bit of a stretch-- it does illustrate how big the upside *could* be if a lot things go perfectly right. As I said at the start of this post, I'm in it for the long term. Very long. Until we see consistent, positive operational progress on QB2, however, I expect it to trade near where it's at, which may prove to big a big buying opportunity...or not.

**What are your thoughts?** Is Wells Fargo seeing something fundamental that the rest of the market (and other analysts) is missing? Or does the $101 target seem disconnected from Teck's current operational reality? Is mining --not BItcoin, but actual rocks from the ground-- something you even consider investing in? I'm keen to hear different perspectives.

Thanks for listening.
Never heard of TECK so I won’t comment on it, but analyst price targets mean absolutely nothing. The street is hyper bullish on their coverage because it encourages deal flow and good relations with management. Don’t take their price targets at face value As a contractor who has done work for some of Teck’s operations in Canada they have no clue what they’re doing and throw money away, just my two cents I have no positions. I believe in the copper story but Teck is one of the worst run mining companies out there.  SCCO is best of breed for copper, Ivanhoe mines or First Quantum if you want to speculate. That analyst has a 44% success rate, and an average of 2% return on those success. 


Thanks, but no thanks  Thanks for sharing. I value this kind of feedback. I've heard good things from some who work for Teck, but your comment about throwing money away does track with their mishaps/difficulties over the years (e.g. the oil sands project). Agreed. TECK is, by its nature, not a longterm hold.

It can make you fantastic amounts of money… if you perfectly understand the cyclical nature of Canadian mining stocks and are able to accurately time your buy and sell.

Please see the chart since 2002. JPM and MS have both downgraded in the past month and have low 40s targets.  Trusting an outlier analyst is a quick way to go broke. Sure, I think people gravitate towards Teck because it’s probably the most famous Canadian mining company and I’m guessing you are Canadian… it’s familiarity bias.

The thing about Teck is that management is really really bad at allocating capital, most of their assets are mid tier aside from QB2… which is a top tier asset that’s been fumbled by a company that doesn’t know how to execute big projects or have any cost discipline.  Teck is also really bloated.

Ivanhoe has near term issues because an over aggressive mine plan led to some issues at Komoa Kukula… but that’s still the third best copper mine on the planet.  And they have shown they can bring projects on in a relatively short time frame.

With First Quantum you are betting that the Panama situation will get resolved, and it looks like it will.  If it does Cobre Panama is one of the best mines in the world.

And if you just want pure play copper mining exposure, just get SCCO.  There is no reason to choose Teck.

My question may as well go here...

Almost a year ago I made a bet on COMM. For the last 90 days they've traded over 5 and steadily grew into the 7's. They announce they're selling part of their business and it went up like 70% on Monday and by closing Friday it's over $15. This fixes all their debt problems but also loses their biggest earner. I'm guessing the stock shot up because they announced some of the excess cash will go to a dividend when the deal closes in early 2026. 

Every time something I have rapidly blows up 100% or more (like TSLA and AMD did) I cash out and run. Then I watch it go up and up. I don't see COMM going to the moon like those but maybe it can just be a healthy company again. I suspect it may crash the second everyone gets their dividend check. But the company also got several upgraded ratings and would seem to be in a good position to pivot or expand into whatever they want. 

Take the money and run on Monday?

Sell the day before the dividend?

Hey. You. Yes you. The market is closed. 


Stop reading this and go spend time with your family You bozos are my only family Investment just hit $100k! Woohoo! First milestone, $200k next! A lot of people seem to forget that current valuations are very atypical. The Shiller P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is 38.15. The only other times in history it was near this level were 1929 and 1999, both just before large market crashes. The P/E ratio is 29. Can't expect current valuations to persist. They could also all pull it at the same time. I mean, what happened in April? It went down 20%. It wasn't sustained not because of retail but because macro changed. The tariffs reversed.


If they hadn't, and it went down another 10%, I think you would have seen people get nervous and pull their money just like every other crash. Then companies get nervous, lay off, more are forced to sell etc. And it's easier for them to sell, like you said. 


The recipe for a crash is clearly still valid.  It's overvalued by every possible metric. RDDT is posting daily active user gains according to semrush data. They just dropped a quarter that has 76% YOY revenue growth. They have no debt on their balance sheet. Turning into an amazing growth company. I think they are just getting started with ads as well. So much upward potential being a top 10 website and only valued at 40 billion. Look at whatever metric you like. Valuations are high. There's zero doubt about that. This is a weird market. I don’t believe in it fundamentally, but I believe others believe so have to stay in for now for the melt up.

1mlhokv,2025-08-09,"Made a huge mistake investing a lot into ETFs
As a first time investor, I made the mistake of investing 30k at 37 years old into VOO around November 2024. I was DCAing about 5k per month and had hit about 50k before the market crashed in April. Unfortunately, I did not have a lot of cash on the sidelines and I wanted to build an emergency fund, so I did just that. I saved 15k, but I missed out on a lot of opportunities in the market. I did have a chance to buy Google, Amazon and VOO when the market was low, but not much (only 2500 of each). I have since added about another 5k of Google, 1k of Amazon, and 2.5k of UNH. I am only up 10% since November. I  feel bad seeing many people up 30% to 70% year to date, while I have nowhere near those returns. Unfortunately I did not have the cash ready to invest when the market was down, and chose to build an emergency fund instead. I also started a position in PLTR in November at $58 before buying VOO, but did not trust it and sold out due to fear of the unknown. As we all know now, that was a huge mistake. I am now focused on buying individual stocks, and will not make the same mistake of lump summing money into an ETF. What are some mistakes that you have made in the market? How did you learn and come back from them?

You’re upset you’re only up 10% in a year? Your mistake wasn’t buying VOO. You more than anyone should be buying VOO In 9 months!  Here we go again You also missed out a lot of potential loss too by sticking with ETFs. You are having this conversation because you think about the money you could have made instead of money you could have lost. You should just balance your investment strategy with some ETF and some stocks. Building that emergency fund wasn’t a mistake  it’s insurance. Missed rallies hurt, but cash + patience beats panic every time word of advice - you are not cut out for individual stocks. drop the ego and just stick to etfs You could have also bought UNH in november guess what would happen now, etf covers that... If something happens and Trump cuts of PLTR you know what will hapen... of course ETF's dont do 100% ytd but ya know... it aint crashing and if it would, we would be too fucked to care abt it It is safter to invest in VOO than individual stocks.

I made money shorting RDDT after the first record high. Now I want to do it again but their earnings report is stupefying to me. How can they be pulling in that much dough from advertisers? I never even notice ads on here. I can't believe advertisers would pay a lot to RDDT in the apparent belief that redditors are going to turn into big time paying customers. (?)  
Cramer said ""amazing digital advertising business because it’s basically the last bastion of the old school internet""  WTF?  That makes no sense to me. What am I missing?

EDIT:  To respond to some of the resultant conjecture below:   
1 AI says ""*Reddit’s dominant income source continues to be advertising—ranging from* ***84% to nearly 98%****, depending on the period and granularity observed. Revenue from data licensing (i.e., “selling data” to AI firms) remains relatively minor, generally in the* ***low single-digit to low double-digit percent*** *range of total revenue.*""  
2 Its super high PE indicates high expectations -- PE is not proof of an eventual outcome. The dotcom bubble was riddled with high PEs.  
3 This 'great company' as someone commented, and a great deal of its userbase constitute a cesspool. From a returned-CEO caught rigging interactions to ""communities"" openly flowing with hate for others, it can never provide paying advertisers the return they now think they're getting-- any more than NXDR did. It has the same web of fifedoms where humans inevitably run their community in variant and non contrubitive ways. Its Q424 news letter is full of unprovable and exaggerated puffery to keep the mirage (to advertisers) going; I'm calling BS on their DAUq tallies. This mirage can't last. META towers over RDDT because, though it has groups, META is user-centric and therefore localized fiefdoms can't trod on META users like they do in RDDT and NXDR. The truth always eventually comes out and so advertisers will some day learn this. If you want to argue this, take a look at Bytedance's TikTok and answer for yourself why it will never be publicly traded. 

Thanks for the few who posted helpful responses. Some responses were predictable or simply wrong, and I provided links in more comments.


Just use the official Reddit app. There are ads embedded in threads everyone knows shorting great companies that are growing fast is the key to success Cramer is spot on.  I am in a sub, I see ads targeted at my interests and comments. Idk the advertiser haven’t seemed to realise Facebook is just full of bots and they still waste money on it They have a lot of targeting data based on what you’re viewing so they must have determined you need to borrow money and the advertisers are willing to pay for you to see their ads Based on the ads I get on Reddit, I wonder if they think I am literally a gay bear. Yeah been seeing a ton of moneylending ones… Honestly the targeting is really not good. Speaking as someone who has clients using Reddit ads. With the data Reddit has it should be a lot better. If they don’t figure it out and make it more effective the ad revenue is probably going to plateau around where Twitter/Snap/Pinterest is. Feel free to disagree but Reddit is sitting on a gold mine.

1mleoyz,2025-08-09,"How are stocks priced to demand?
To clarify my question is basically how much does a stock’s price increase when there’s for example 100 buyers and 99 sellers. Obviously the stock price would go up but by what amount? i’ve looked this up on google but didn’t find any conclusive answer. 
What if you have 100 buyers willing to pay $1 per share, but 99 sellers only willing to accept $2 per share? There are more variables to consider than just volume of buyers and sellers The ""price"" is whatever the last traded price is Very few accurate answers here. 

The price you see is the ""mark"" and generally resides between the bid and ask prices. 

If I own a share and am willing to sell it for 100 then I can place a sell order there. If a buyer is only willing to pay 98 they aren't going to be able to buy my share. If we are the only two people in the market you'd see a stock price of 99 and the bid/ask spread of 2. 

If you create a market order you will ""cross the spread"" and pay the price the seller is offering, in this case 100 and you create buying or upward pressure on the stock.

If I, on the other hand, do a market sell, I may sell for less than the 100 I wanted, creating selling or downward pressure. 

In reality, and to maintain liquidity, you have marker makers. They will be the ones actually buying your shares in many cases and then selling them to others. They make profit because of the bid ask spread, they pocket the pennies in between but the sheer volume of trades they make means they make significant profits This is the answer. If OP reads how market makers work, that will answer the question. Read about market making It goes up if sellers want to sell for more than current price and buyers pay it Your obviously situation could be wrong in lots of situations. 

What if the 99 sellers all are willing to accept a price at least 5% below the current ? You need the bid and ask prices Last recorded price is only the best estimate of the market price. Sometimes the spread between bid and ask grows so wide that there effectively is no established market price or existing market aka the market is illiquid.

1ml430o,2025-08-08,"CPI report incoming 8/12 Tuesday. Possibility Trump names a new head of BLS during the weekend and tamper the CPI data to his favor?
He did say he will be picking a new guy for BLS this week.

High chance it's a puppet who'll do anything Trump will ask.

In this case it's reports on inflation.

Which, if indeed the report says inflation is high it ruins the chance for rate cut in September and causing the market to tank the coming Tuesday.

But if the inflation is reported to not have risen much rate cut is still on the table and Market Rallies.

Trump who is begging for rate cut... I don't see him letting the truth out the inflation has risen therefore hindering the chance of rate cut by Jpowell.

Tbh we don't know if the inflation has risen the chips were always $3-5 a bag aways...

However I want to know your guys thoughts on the result of the upcoming CPI.

If CPI report there is no inflation. Can we trust that result? And will the market just accept whatever fact Trump gives us and rallies into ATH again?
the fact you cannot trust the numbers from what is supposed to be the highest credibility economy in the world is insane. But if the president shows a chart of a line going up behind the desk in the oval office we should be good 👍 Personally I am operating under the assumption all US data for the next 3.5 years at least will be fudged. They will sweep inflation under the rug and pretend it isn't happening. You forget the part where investors love fake numbers until shit literally begins to collapse. Logic cannot be applied here, the market will continue to rally. Not ideal. But this could start a cottage industry of companies getting real inflation data.

1ml3134,2025-08-08,"what is the best metric to use for highlighting market share of a company in a specific industry?
Hi, i'm trying to visualize market shares of companies in a given industry like airlines, cars etc. I was thinking of using market cap, but it seems too subjective (like how much people trust that company as opposed to how well it's doing). is total revenue a good metric or is it too rough for market share indicator?

also, at the moment i'm limited by public companies simply because i dont have a resource for private companies. i had a look online and orbis database seems exactly what i need but it's way too expensive. do you know something similar that's free to use?

another question, i use finbox screener for getting public company data. exporting tables requires a paid account so i copy-paste then transpose in google sheets. if you know any websites that allow exporting, that'd be great. the option is locked for some reason in yahoo finance, and trading view only exports a single chart i think, not a list.

1ml05ro,2025-08-08,"Cover Call/Options Strategy ETFs
I'm trying to build some dividend yielding ETFs in my Roth so I can continue to produce capital tax free and invest I've been looking at SPYI and QQQI and wondering what the big con is? I know they pay out 10%+ in annual yield and you don't get any of the gains when the market goes up but I'm strictly just looking for yields at this point. I have a fair share of SCHD and some DGRO but was thinking about setting aside some amounts to SPYI, QQQI, and JEPQ. From what I understand and historically they have been fairly stable but we have been in insane bull market since covid. I know they are also knew but past performance doesn't indicate future performance.
The big ""con"" is that they tend to underperform and you're essentially betting on market timing to make them worthwhile. I would avoid and just stick to vanilla index funds. Max downside for a covered call is $0 + the value of the contract, which is pennies on the dollar relative to the underlying. Once you blow past the breakeven point, the free fall is similar to buy and hold.

And no, the trade-off for the upside cap is protection against slow bleeds and small disruptions. The strategy is inefficient with respect to large unpriced moves in either direction. ya but those look to good to be true lol. I haven't done the adequate research on them tbh but anything paying out 130% you're probably losing out somehow and I'm sure there are some downsides to it. I don't invest in anything until I know the ins-n-outs lol too much junk out there It's not,  ymax pays a dividend of roughly 1%-2% per week, other etfs they run pay out monthly. just got my dividend from them. The downside is since they're selling covered calls the upside is limited and same issue with them selling puts since they can get locked into a higher cost basis position than current price. 

You can check them out at www.yieldmaxetfs.com to get the full image There is no big con: your returns will replicate writing your own covered calls minus the expense ratio (which can be big).   Covered calls are a neutral to bullish strategy with lower returns than owning shares.   

Basically, these products are like buying SPY with a portion of your money: they replicate capital inefficiency while holding a lot of downside risk. Have you looked into yieldmax ETFs? I'm not recommending them persay but I do have a small position in my Roth in ULTY and it's dividend payout is 130%. Elaborate on the downside risk? is this just not a covered call strategy that they are doing?

Would your downside also be limited in a bear market as your upside in a bull market? I have some JEPQ in mine.  If it holds, it’ll be a nice little source of retirement income.

But the better move is to build up enough shares of long term stock or ETF to sell your own CC’s.  For example: if you own 100 shares of SPY, you can sell covered calls and safely make at least $30-$60 a day. That’s $9k-$15k a year, which is significantly more than your annual contributions.",2,1.0,8,0,Vast_Newt_1799,stocks,['SPY'],cover calloptions strategy etfs im trying build dividend yielding etfs roth continue produce capital tax free invest ive looking spyi qqqi wondering big con know pay 10 annual yield dont get gains market goes im strictly looking yields point fair share schd dgro thinking setting aside amounts spyi qqqi jepq understand historically fairly stable insane bull market since covid know also knew past performance doesnt indicate future performance big con tend underperform youre essentially betting market timing make worthwhile would avoid stick vanilla index funds max downside covered call 0 value contract pennies dollar relative underlying blow past breakeven point free fall similar buy hold tradeoff upside cap protection slow bleeds small disruptions strategy inefficient respect large unpriced moves either direction ya look good true lol havent done adequate research tbh anything paying 130 youre probably losing somehow im sure downsides dont invest anything know insnouts lol much junk ymax pays dividend roughly 12 per week etfs run pay monthly got dividend downside since theyre selling covered calls upside limited issue selling puts since get locked higher cost basis position current price check wwwyieldmaxetfscom get full image big con returns replicate writing covered calls minus expense ratio big covered calls neutral bullish strategy lower returns owning shares basically products like buying spy portion money replicate capital inefficiency holding lot downside risk looked yieldmax etfs im recommending persay small position roth ulty dividend payout 130 elaborate downside risk covered call strategy would downside also limited bear market upside bull market jepq mine holds itll nice little source retirement income better move build enough shares long term stock etf sell ccs example 100 shares spy sell covered calls safely make least 3060 day thats 9k15k year significantly annual contributions
1mkzgmj,2025-08-08,"You don’t own enough Google- Another “Google is undervalued” post
OpenAI just released their frontier model and suffice to say… it flopped. 

People are waiting with bated breath to see what Google has cooked up. They already released Genie 3, which nobody is even close to yet on world models. I think it will be trivial for them to surpass or at least catch up to OpenAI on the intelligence front for frontier LMM. And they have always been better than other AI companies from a context length and cost perspective. 

Just from an AI front, Google is killing it. Their narrow AI is winning Nobel prizes with Alphafold. Discovering algorithms with AlphaEvolve. Advancing robotics. 

Even if you don’t think Google will win the AI race to general intelligence or don’t even believe anyone will get there (which is the long term “this stock will absolutely explode if they hit AGI” bet):


let’s just look at valuations:

If OpenAI is valued at $500b then Deepmind is easily $500b. 

If Netflix is $500b then Youtube is easily $700b. 

Search is easily $1-2T. 

Now we are sitting around Googles current $2.5T valuation. 

But there’s more! 

How much is Google Cloud worth? Easily $300+ billion just based on current revenue. 

This is part of cloud but how much is their tensor chip tech alone worth? AI specific compute that’s competitive to Nvidia? Short answer is: a lot. 

If Tesla is worth $1T partly off self driving car hype, how much is Waymo worth? Easily $100-200b. 

How much is the Android/Google Play business worth? 

How much is every app that we all use daily worth? (Chrome, Maps, Gmail, Docs, Drive, etc)


I know this has been said before but Google is literally a competitor to every single major Tech companies business. They have their hands in every single pot. Whilst, they have historically had issues with marketing and selling their product, their product suite *is good*. They don’t just have a useless competitor like bing is to their search, they actually put up real competition like Google Docs is to Word. 

People talk about the risk of Google getting broken up but that might be the best thing for investors. The individual parts of Google are so valuable that forcing the market to value them separately might actually unlock value. It wouldn’t be crazy if a breakup made investors richer, not poorer (at least in the short term). The market would finally have to pull its head out of its ass and price these pieces properly. (Edit: This part is hyperbole to make a point, I don’t actually think a breakup would be good for investors) 
Haven't used google in over 20 years besides youtube, gmail, chrome, gemini, waymo.  Besides that its trash. Whenever I'm in foreign countries trying to read signs, it always use Bing translate......said nobody ever. Tesla is not worth 1T, Netflix is not worth 500B, OpenAI is not worth 500B. Besides, your “If A is worth B, then X is worth Y” reasoning is off. You are basically saying the market values all companies correctly, except Google? The problem with google is that they are always technologically superior but seem to have trouble with building awesome business out of their tech

They did cloud computing internally before AWS was a thing

Their voice assistant technology was superior to Alexa since I remember

Their AI and language understanding tech was also superior to anything anyone else had before OpenAI released gpt3

I don't get it why they flop so much on monetizing their amazing tech but I wouldn't be surprised if we will see repeat of that - googles assistant will be state of the art and best models while someone else makes money on that on something inferior but much better with making money I just Ask Jeeves And they're way ahead in self-driving cars, but people talk about Tesla as if it were equivalent to Waymo.

It lacks the ability to hype itself. The big issue is that Google has too many good businesses in one, and so that causes people to look for a simpler way to value the business, and the only way they can think of doing so is by viewing it as a search company lol. ...Google Maps, Waze, G-Suite (docs, sheets, etc.) Lol Every time anybody uses any Google product, they train their AI model...

Big stupid levers, that’s how I'm not informed enough to answer your question but from what I understand, leveraged stocks are meant to be day traded rather than held over a period of time. Losses are magnified more than gains. If the stock price stays the same, the leveraged stocks will lose money. Someone else can explain why. Anyway, I stay away from leveraged stocks because I don't understand them. Sorry if this is a useless answer. Guy asks for an explanation and everyone here is giving him shit for trying to understand better. Like he's doing the thing you are saying he should do. SMH It's mathematical. If a stock goes down 6% then up 6%, you're actually still down on your initial investment because you went up by 6% on a smaller number than what you went down by 6% on. Adding leverage to these mechanics means you're amplifying that loss. 

If a stock is not consistently going up, but instead fluctuating between down and up days, even if the general trend is up you will not be making 3x on an 3x leverage investment for that reason. Plus depending on the vehicle there can be quite sizeable fees that eat into your return even further. You are playing with dangerous financial instruments you dont understand at all Say something drops 10% and then goes up 10%, it isn’t actually break even. 100 drops to 90 and then raises 10% to 99% - that is what is happening here, but at 3x the effect.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

🙏GOOG cracked $200 for the first time in about a year. Finally! There's no one I'd prefer to share this with personally but hit the ol' 7 figs for the first time today. Thinking its a good excuse to hit up a fire dinner spot tonight to start the weekend

That said, my assets are very heavily weighted in my brokerage so I'm sure it'll go back below, potentially significantly Should have just mag7 and chill, instead been working with small caps and getting slightly lower returns with 10x more effort.... Hi, I'm new to stocks. The higher P/E the better stock is, right? So all in Palantar? Tonight, instead of McDonald's, I'm treating myself to a fancy place, like the Olive Garden!!! Congrats to GOOGL bulls. The ""it's just a search company"" bears in shambles. It's unique in that it's not only overpriced so people are jealous they missed out on it but it is also helping the US government become even more of a dictator surveillance state. This is has been such a wonky earning season for me. Stuff is up or down double digits, and even the stuff that is down, has bounced back a bit the next day. 

Seen a ton of names flip from positive to negative and vice versa intraday as well. 

Just an odd season. GPT 5 was released and it's way way below expectation

1mkea5z,2025-08-07,"Tesla disbands Dojo Supercomputer Team, Bloomberg Reports
https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-disbands-dojo-supercomputer-team-bloomberg-news-reports-2025-08-07/

Ahem, calls! 

Tesla Inc. is disbanding its Dojo supercomputer team and its leader will depart the company, according to people familiar with the matter, upending the automaker’s effort to develop in-house chips for driverless technology.

Peter Bannon, who was heading up Dojo, is leaving and Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has ordered the effort to be shut down, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. The team has lost about 20 workers recently to newly formed DensityAI, and remaining Dojo workers are being reassigned to other data center and compute projects within Tesla, the people said.
I heard Cathie Woods just raised her price target Hey Tesla bros 

Get ready to be forced to buy xAI for the hilarious AI valuations being tossed around. Except this time, it comes after Elon dispersed your GPUs to xAI and then disbanded your Dojo team. 

lol enjoy Will be funny to look back on this piece of shit in 10 years and laugh at how dumb everyone was that invested in it. So at the very least $5000 by 2030 now? Anytime I comment on Tesla I lose karma points. So, no comment… Reddit has historically been *very right* about Tesla stock's future. Promises are just numbers It's up 232% in the last 5 years and has been anything but flat; it's volatile as hell but that has rewarded people who strategically buy dips and sell covered calls into highs on elevated IV. So does that mean Samsung isn’t getting 16 billion to make their chips? $400 ODTE calls

1mkcur7,2025-08-07,"I’m seriously considering consolidating my entire portfolio into Apple (AAPL)
So here’s what I’m wrestling with:
Why shouldn’t I sell my Amazon and AMD positions and go all-in on Apple? ( I already got some apple shares ) 
Am I overlooking some major risk with Apple that others see?
Is this level of concentration just asking for trouble or is it conviction?
Apple feels “boring,” but is boring what wins?
Would I regret not having exposure to AMD’s AI upside or Amazon’s cloud/growth potential in 5 years?
Is Apple too big to generate the same returns going forward?
Apple is growing mid single digits every year and has a higher valuation than meta and Google who both grow large double digits. Apple has struggled significantly with AI and has lower margins than both of the latter companies. I don’t see why you would pick Apple out of all the MAG7 to full-port into (which also is a terrible idea to do to any company) You’re a fool.

Oh shit this is /r/stocks and not /r/personalfinance

Go for it mate despite how some imbeciles will mock u or other index huggers will write u off, you're on the right track. all the greats like w. f o'neil, buffett, etc made their vast fortunes by essentially placing as many eggs in as few baskets as possible. buffet himself said diversification is a hedge against ignorance but isnt necessary if u know what youre doing. im long RUM \[rddt, uber, meta\] and thats all i buy every month whn i get paid.

u dont need to own a ton of stocks and u can be bolder than all the index huggers and more successful. Take a look at CISCo stock which peaked around March 2000 and then ask yourself if it’s a good idea to go all-in on 1 stock because it’s the “big and popular” or whatever your heuristic is. Did the Google search see Gemini’s response below .. growth is stagnating for Apple, overall revenue is greater at Apple, but Google being SAAS and a cloud provider has better margins. 

Apple's and Google's (Alphabet's) revenue growth rates show a mixed picture depending on the time period considered:
Recent quarterly growth (Q2 2025)
Google (Alphabet): Alphabet reported a 14% year-over-year increase in consolidated revenues to $96.4 billion.
Apple: Apple's revenue grew 5% year-over-year, reaching $95.4 billion. 

Last 12 months (ending June 30, 2025)
Google (Alphabet): Alphabet's revenue for the trailing twelve months was $371.40 billion, representing a 13.13% year-over-year increase.
Apple: Apple's revenue for the twelve months ending March 31, 2025, was $400.366 billion, a 4.91% increase year-over-year. A grown ass man asking the internet why he should or shouldn’t put all his eggs into one basket 😂 Long rddt over here also! qqq I would advice against putting all your eggs in one basket even if it is one of the biggest safest baskets around. You don’t know what will happen in the future and are very exposed to the performance of one company so in the event of a big negative impulse(ban from china, big European fines and so on you will feel the effects massively).

1mk40tz,2025-08-07,"I think the market overreacted to CROX earnings
Hello, here are some key takeaways from their earnings: 

Today theyre trading at about 80$ a share, 4.4B market cap. Down over 20% in reaction today, so here are some numbers they reported 


Returned over 200M to shareholders, over 100M in debt pay down and share buybacks each

Revenue grew 3% to 1149M, non-GAAP EPS up 5% to 4.23

47% of their revenue is international (not affected by taco tarriffs) and that segment revenue grew 16% YoY

So why the drop? They removed full year guidance and next quarter are projecting 9-11% revenue loss YoY due to the tarriff man 

My positions: I bought 160 shares today,  150 of them on margin

Thank you for reading, what are your thoughts?
They didn’t remove guidance? They forecasted negative growth which is considerably worse. -9% revenue y/y is nothing to scoff at, and I’d say it warrants a significant punishment, granted the valuation was already very low. The impairment of HEYDUDE just shows how weak the brand has gotten. -6% growth in NA is worrying, though international was better than expected

All in all, crocs has a lot it needs to turnaround, and its cheap valuation is really its only redeeming factor, though it’s cheap for a reason Are Crocs a fashion industry fad? 10-Year Revenue CAGR 15%; 10-Year EPS CAGR 50%; 10-Year Cash Flow from Operations CAGR 61%; 10-Year Equity CAGR 17%. A decade of double-digit growth across the most important financial metrics isn’t a fad, it’s a quality company. If Mr. Market is off his medication and wants to sell it to me this cheaply, I say “Thank you; more please.” My position: 1 old pair of Crocs that I will never replace because they are now $75 I bought some today too, because it still is a sound company who will rebound so it's hard to resist the great discount.

One thing I will never do though is to invest with money I do not have. Because gaining these extra won't be life-changing (at least for this situation), but losing them will really be a hot mess. Yup, I don't understand this drop at all. Will defenitely look to buy some Are they? I've never bought any bit a quick Google search shows tons of them for $20-$30 I also bought some shares today. It's an overreaction and CROX will continue to grow as it had for the past two decades. Solid take. Market hates uncertainty more than bad news guidance pull spooked the herd. But CROX fundamentals still strong, so your buy-in might age well if international momentum holds. You pick up any shares today?

1mk3yov,2025-08-07,"Uber in talks with banks, private equity firms to fund Waymo expansion
Uber (UBER.N), opens new tab is in talks with private equity firms and banks to secure funds to build its robotaxi business, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said, as the ride-hailing giant bets on a mass roll-out of the nascent and much-scrutinized technology.


Uber, which offers robotaxis from Alphabet (GOOGL.O), opens new tab-owned Waymo, has been strengthening its foothold in the self-driving taxi industry through partnerships with automakers such as Volkswagen (VOWG.DE), opens new tab and Lucid (LCID.O), opens new tab, just as Tesla (TSLA.O), opens new tab seeks to expand its fledgling robotaxi business.

Khosrowshahi on Wednesday pitched the tie-ups as part of a larger plan that involves three robotaxi business models: paying partners that own such vehicles a fixed rate, sharing revenue with fleet operators and owning vehicles while licensing software for self-driving technology.


""We are talking to private equity players, we have talked to banks,"" the CEO said. ""Once we prove the revenue model, how much these cars can generate on a per day basis, there will be plenty of financing to go around.""
For now, Uber said it was planning on using a ""modest"" portion of its around $7 billion in annual cash flows to fund deployments. It might also sell minority stakes in companies to aid the expansion, it said.


Analysts have said that mass robotaxi deployment could lower driver-reliant Uber's operating costs and boost profitability.
The company has been offering Waymo robotaxis on its ride-hailing app in Austin, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia. In April, Uber entered a deal with Volkswagen for thousands of autonomous electric vans in the United States over the next decade.

GOOG not $200 is a crime against humanity. GOOBER Opens new tab huh? I hope they’ll be able to pay the tab… Did he think about issuing equity for buybacks?

More specifically, why are they buying $20bn of shares supposedly if they also need to raise cash for robotaxi partnerships and expansions? Calls on UBER or GOOG? Or both? Shhh You should really open a new tab Can’t wait… let’s see how Uber will manage this mess.. right now, Waymo is  still losing money. Economies of scale theoretically should make it profitable but in major cities like NY, Chicago, SFO, Paris, London…real estate is a premium..EVs have limited range, logistics is a major challenge. Maintenance - cleaning, charging, repairs will require a depot not just charging stations. Insurance is another matter. Let’s see how profitable the personal transportation business will be when Uber will finally incur all the cost/mile driven instead of the human drivers and Waymo - Lidar fitted jaguar cars cost $250,000 each…without Tariffs - this should go down, how much lower? only Uber can negotiate that.

1mk0xc0,2025-08-07,"Can the Firefly IPO... Fly? (DD on $FLY)
# I love IPOs!!!!!!!!!!

The last IPO I thought was amazing was Figma [(it's been a week lol).](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ma8fm5/figuring_out_the_figma_ipo_dd_on_fig/) Firefly is opening today and there is, to put it lightly, hype.

**Can Firefly Fly? You would not believe your eyes, etc etc.**

Firefly Aerospace Inc. is a Texas-based space and defense technology founded in 2017 that provides ""end-to-end mission solutions for government and commercial clients"". They **design, manufacture, and operate** their own rockets and spacecraft with vertically integrated production facilities.

Firefly’s business has two main segments: Launch Services (delivering satellites and payloads to orbit) and Spacecraft Solutions (building vehicles like lunar landers and orbital transfer tugs). Its flagship Alpha rocket [(Link to one of their rockets) ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_Alpha)is a small-lift launcher (\~2K lbs to low Earth orbit) that first reached orbit in 2022 and has since completed four orbital missions. On the spacecraft side, the Blue Ghost lander landed on the Moon landing in March 2025, and are developing Elytra orbital vehicles for satellite deployment and lunar data relay services. Firefly positions itself as a one-stop shop for space missions, combining launch vehicles, lunar landers, and in-orbit services to meet demand from national security and commercial customers seeking rapid access to space. Looking ahead, Firefly is expanding into medium-lift launch with Eclipse**,** a larger, partially reusable rocket co-developed with Northrop Grumman.

**FireFly Financials (Lighting cash on fire, in addition to flies)**

Firefly is **unprofitable due to heavily investing in R&D/production. This is expected for a company that require massive upfront capital and long development cycles before achieving commercial scale**. Doubly so for spaceflight companies. 

# Metrics (USD Millions)

|Metric|FY 2023|FY 2024|Q1 2024|Q1 2025|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Revenue**|$55.2|$60.8|$8.3|$55.9|
|**Gross Profit**|$26.6|–$11.4|–$1.9|$2.2|
|**Gross Margin**|48.2%|–18.7%|–23.1%|4.0%|
|**Operating Income**|–$131.9|–$209.5|–$49.1|–$58.5|
|**Net Income**|–$135.5|–$231.1|–$52.8|–$60.1|

**Note: There is no information from 2022, the financial information in this S-1 is notably sparse.** 

The company’s **net losses are deepening**. Firefly reported a **$231.1 million net loss in 2024,** mainly due to heavy spending on development. R&D expense alone was $149.5 million in 2024! In Q1 2025, Firefly lost another $60.1 million despite the revenue jump. 

**Firefly acknowledges that it** **does not expect to be profitable for several years as it scales production and develops new vehicles.**

As of March 31, 2025, the company had **$176.9 million in cash** on hand, but also carried **$147.7 million in debt**. The IPO proceeds (targeting \~$600+ million) are thus crucial to replenish cash. Ironically, this is what IPOs are meant for- securing more cash in order to stay alive (in addition to gaining liquidity for their shares). Gross margin was negative in 2024 (119% of revenue), and operating/net margins are negative as well. Firefly NEEDS massive revenue scaling and more launches to absorb the MASSIVE (low-taper fade) cost base they've spent. 

On the flip side, demand is very, very high. FireFly reported a $1.1B backlog as of their S-1 filing, nearly double what they had end of 2023, and have contracts with the US government and defense primes (companies with direct links to the government like LMT/BA/NOC).

Something interesting I read in the S1 was that that 95% of the 2024 revenue came from three customers- (speculated to be NASA, USAF, and someone unknown) so revenue is lumpy, as it usually is with these contract based companies). 

**Shareholders/Funding History**

The company’s largest shareholder is AE Industrial Partners (AEI), a aerospace-focused private equity firm. AEI made its initial investment in Firefly in 2022 to acquire a controlling stake from the prior owner and will own \~42% of the company, and control >50% of voting power post-IPO. Firefly’s current Chairman, Kirk Konert, is a partner at AEI, and AEI led multiple funding rounds. For all intents and purposes, I consider AEI to own Firefly. 

Aside from AEI, key investors include strategic partners and venture firms like Northrop Grumman and Astera Institute, a nonprofit/VC entity, which owns about 10% pre-IPO. Tom Markusic, Firefly’s co-founder and former CEO, owns roughly 9-10% stake pre-IPO. There's a lot more I can go into but there IS a decent amount of demand for these shares, and the current cap table is dominated by AEI, Northrop, Astera, and management. **No existing stockholders are selling in the IPO (based on the S1), so this isn't a quick dump on retail from shareholders.** 

**Risks** 

**Firefly has never been profitable and has stated it expects to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. It is entirely reliant on external funding, and looking at their financials, it looks completely possible they will dilute shareholders further within a year of IPOing.** 

Rockets themselves are risky, they can experience launch failures, delays, explosions, same stuff that we've seen with SpaceX rockets. If you need a reference point look up what happened when other spaceflight companies couldn't get their launches on time, the stock would tank. Tariffs are also likely to affect this company materially, and the space market is cutthroat and Firefly is late to the party. In launch services, SpaceX, are already the major players Rocket Lab. In lunar landers, it has to compete with LUNR and other private companies developing the same. 

As noted before, revenue is highly tied to government contracts and a few key customers (US governmental agencies and defense contractors). If we ever have a president that likes to change his mind a lot, this could be a serious problem. Regulations can also hinder Firefly's business operations (FAA launch licenses, export controls, FCC licenses, environmental studies (pretty sure SpaceX ignores these lol), and can hinder/suspend operations. 

**TL;DR** Firefly is pretty much a typical risky space startup- there's execution risk, market risk, geopolitical risk, political risk, technical risk, funding/financial risk, competitor risk, ownership risk, rocketships blowing up risk. The company isn't profitable, will likely dilute their shareholders and is owned by a PE firm (which is not a great sign). It DOES have technology that performs (they can actually land on the moon) and a decently sized backlog, but the financials are disastrous and the IPO valuation is currently at 90x 2024 sales. 

Thinking back on my Figma DD, I liked Figma because literally any UX developer could tell you how useful Figma was to their job and how it dominates the industry, but FLY seems like a small puppy owned by a puppy mill breeder (AEI) dropped off into a den of feral pitbulls. The ownership by AEI is a huge concern of mine and essentially a nail in the coffin of why I'm not interested in a long-term investment. 

Is this going to be something like RKLB, or something closer to Virgin Galactic which had a hype run? The company seems cool in concept, but I'm leaning the latter. 

But hey, in the words of Roman Roy from Succession: ""I don’t mean to be facetious but, Sarah, on that point - I’m not a rocket scientist""

 
2.5/6 launches successful compared to 65/69 for RKLB for what it's worth So many rocket companies So much risk, but it's already valued at $9B hmmmmm, pretty sure there'll better time to pick up shares in this one Firefly needed (used) rocket labs tech to help get and land on the moon as well.

1mjz4sn,2025-08-07,"People looking at Archer (ACHR) now… what’s your actual thesis?
So Archer Aviation just got a price target bump from JPMorgan from $9 to $10 but they still kept it at neutral. Stock popped a few percent on that, but trading volume was weak

I’ve been watching this one for a while but still not sure if we’re actually at a good entry or just chasing hype

The legal situation is partly cleaned up Delaware court dismissed liability claims against the CEO. That seems like a decent win, though there are still unresolved claims about misrepresentation of valuation & their Midnight aircraft progress

The FAA certification deadline is still 2025 & they’ve got ~$6B in conditional orders from names like United Airlines and the DoD. Big numbers but still conditional & they’re burning cash with a projected $1.32/share loss this year. That said, they’ve got about $1B in liquidity to ride it out

JPMorgan wasn’t the only one weighing in, firms like Needham still have it as a buy at $13.25 average target. Meanwhile, some insiders (CFOs) sold a few million worth, but they still hold sizeable stakes. Institutions like CalSTRS & Private Advisor Group have also increased positions

I guess I’m trying to figure out if this is still a speculative early play on the eVTOL sector or if we’re starting to see a real inflection point with legal risk dropping & institutional interest climbing

Anyone here already holding ACHR or planning to enter? Curious to hear what convinced you either way. Is it about the FAA milestone? The industry tailwinds? Or just betting on Archer specifically vs JOBY & the rest?

Genuinely trying to build a better picture here

https://www.ainvest.com/news/archer-aviation-legal-clarity-jpmorgan-upgrade-late-stage-entry-opportunity-evtol-boom-2508/
They haven’t delivered a product and have zero revenue, so yes I’d say it’s still a speculative play It's a very speculative play I think realistically geared a bit more towards the defensive side given Anduril partnership. It's the ""official air taxi of the 2028 Olympics"" but I can more easily see defense use in the near future. Speculation pump is the only reason I’m in. You put way too much stock into analyst price targets Yeah bro the Olympics tagline is cute but DoD money hits different. Anduril doesn’t play unless there’s real use case.. Archer’s looking more like a classified contract in the making than a rideshare. I have 140 shares of ACHR. A small investment. Just waitibg to see what happens. I had JOBY also. Sold at a profit, but kind of wish I hadn't. People really sleeping on how big the United Airlines partnership is. $1B in liquidity and commercial partners? That’s not vaporware like half this sector. I put together a detailed comparison between Archer and Joby a little while back:

https://www.reddit.com/r/JobyAviation/s/eDRVnNeQ8A

At this time, I think Joby's current market cap is pricing in quite a lot. Basically priced at 6x 2030 revenue. I wouldn't say that Joby is overvalued, necessarily, but it definitely isn't compelling value at this price. 

As far as Archer goes, I think that they should definitely be priced less than Joby. They're basically attacking the same markets as Joby, but are 2 years behind (and maybe more than that). So they should be discounted for being behind in time, as well as higher risks involved with being so early in the certification process. **They're clearly still working on how to transition their aircraft.**

That said, archer is priced at a third of the level of Joby. So this may be a compelling entry price for them. But I do think you may have to wait before the value proposition is realized. Plus, the general eVTOL hype cycle may have reached a near term peak. Bought one $7 Call LEAPS just to be in the game. Still a speculative play at this point.

1mjy16h,2025-08-07,"Up 40% on RBLX - but is this just the beginning of Roblox becoming the YouTube of immersive worlds?
I'm currently up about 40% on RBLX. It's one of the best performers in my portfolio this year. That said, I'm starting to wonder if the valuation is getting ahead of itself… or maybe the market is just correctly pricing it as a long-term compounder now that it's clearly moved beyond being “just a kids’ game.” I’ve been thinking through my thesis here, and while I’ve got a few structured ideas, I’m also very open to feedback. Here’s what I’ve got so far:

**1. Platform Monetization Is Just Getting Started**  
Roblox has gone from raw engagement to a more sophisticated monetization engine, and I think that shift is only just beginning. They’re layering infrastructure and incentives (ads, pricing tools, IP licensing) on top of the existing UGC flywheel. We’re seeing early signs: rewarded video ads are scaling via Google, DevEx payouts are up 52% YoY ($316M), and their new Creator Rewards system is moving away from just time-based payouts toward acquisition and engagement, which is arguably a much healthier structure. Bookings per payer are up 6% YoY, and branded experiences (e.g., Netflix, Sega) suggest IP licensing could become a real revenue stream. All of this supports a potential re-rating on P/S and P/FCF as monetization per DAU improves. Main risk here is that ads could cannibalize IAP or alienate users if poorly implemented.

**2. Global Growth Is Real and Underappreciated**  
The international story is sneaky strong. APAC DAUs are up 76%, bookings up 75% YoY. Indonesia alone is +150%, Korea +120%, India +90%, and Japan +50%. They’ve clearly improved infrastructure (e.g., low-latency servers in Singapore) and localization (auto-translation, regional pricing). The flywheel is kicking in globally. If this trend continues, international markets could provide both DAU and bookings upside, reducing reliance on the U.S. That said, monetization in low-ARPU regions is a risk, and regulatory friction (especially in India or Korea) could become a drag.

**3. Roblox Is Building a Developer OS for the Immersive Economy**  
This is maybe the most exciting angle. They’re not just a game platform, they’re quietly building an operating system for immersive content creation. With tools like Cube 3D (for AI-generated 3D models), Roblox Studio, RoGuard for safety, and better discovery AI, the whole dev stack is becoming much more powerful and user-friendly. There are already over 1 million AI-generated 3D assets live, and build cycles are shortening dramatically. Add in the fact that creators can now monetize physical merch, and we’re looking at an emerging ecosystem that could become to immersive games what Shopify is to ecommerce. Of course, risks include UEFN (Epic) and TikTok’s Project Ripple gaining steam, plus the threat of AI commoditizing content and ongoing moderation burdens.

All this is supported by the rate of change in the financials in almost every single metric.

Anyway, that’s where I’m at. Bullish, but keeping my eyes open. Would love to hear counterpoints or other takes.
the lawsuits of all the games they've been blatantly stealing like get to work and peak are gonna be legendary. I too enjoy exploring child labor and copying IP. No, Roblox is the AliExpress of Steam. Atrioc viewer in the wild It’s a massive grey area - the reality is that Roblox is doing nothing to prevent and hold blatantly stolen games accountable. Additionally, they’ll protect these stolen games with tooth and nail before admitting fault or removing the game. Garbage for the masses.

1mjonq7,2025-08-07,"AAPL: guys who sold looking dumb
AAPL basically dodge the tariffs with Tim Cooks finesse. Cook has been dealing with China for decades. He knows how to negotiate.

Apple just reported 10% revenue growth and 12% profit growth. 

All those anti-trust lawsuits in the US will go away. Tim knows the game.

But the main reason to keep investing in Apple:

Apple has over a BILLION super loyal customers who continue to spend hundreds if not thousands of dollars on Apple products. They are stuck in the Apple ecosystem. The customer retention rate has to be 90-95%. Younger generations love Apple products. 

No other company has this type of brand loyalty at such a massive scale that is willing to spend big dollars. 
I own a lot of AAPL. The only reason for the boost today was due to the tariff dodge and domestic investments. No one could have expected that lol. Post earnings the stock was pretty much flat. Hard to time today Wait until the tariffs start hitting the economic numbers is this pasta?

1mjdr5t,2025-08-06,"Would tomorrow's unemployment data have an impact given how revisions tanked the market and other catalysts that could affect SPY?
I'm assuming since the jobs revisions had an actual affect on the market then unemployment should follow suit given that should correlate with them. Then there's the issue with tariffs, but I would assume he's going to extend again so no point in arguing that. What I am concerned about as well is next week's CPI because that could have an impact on the cuts predicted to come in september. The market is a circus right now, but even then it reacted to harsh data, so would the upcoming data be bad enough to impact it negatively or positively, or flat? Any smarter people that could expand on this and impacts going into next week?
When the numbers are bad market will go up because the fed will lower rates. When the numbers are good market will go up because economy is soaring. It'll be positive, otherwise someone else is going to lose their job. People act like the market never dips. Only a few months ago, Trump tanked the market.


In the start of covid it tanked, and a while in to covid, rates were raised and risky stocks tanked. By making your theory public, you just allowed all the hedge funds' web crawlers to access it and already execute your strategy. All has been priced in now. Sorry, try next time without telling Reddit! Tanked in Covid, then hit its ATH 7 months later, kicking off a bull run that lasted over a year The type of numbers matter though. If we end up in a stagflation then no one wins, and in order for that to happen we need high unemployment and high inflation. Given last months inflation stat and the jobs revisions, it seems we're heading into stagflation. Tomorrows numbers could support that. They haven't hired a new BLS chief yet.

1mjbkv0,2025-08-06,"Rebalancing porfolio
Looking at my portfolio this morning and noticed my stocks are now 45% of my total. Used to be ETFs 85% and stocks 15%, but NVDA, PLTR, META, NFLX, MSFT and a few others went and messed it all up. Several finance forums and books mention rebalancing investments regularly, but I mean do people actually sell super strong stocks to convert to ETFs? I mean wouldn't that be a bad move from a return perspective? But I guess the goal is to secure the profits and remove risky positions.

Curious to know what other people do in this situation.
Assuming you’ve got a good cost basis, 45% in those stocks is something I’d be okay with. I’m assuming/hoping that pltr is the smallest portion of those? It’s been doing well, I own it, but it doesn’t have the legacy and too big to fail status of the others. 

Also for reference, etf’s are only apart of my retirement accounts and not my personal self directed account. Well there is no rule but yours. Personally I’m probably 15% ETFs 70% stocks and the rest in cash. I have no problem selling parts of stocks at the highs to lower risk. You certainly picked some terrific stocks pal. LOL..Depending on your comfort level I’d probably trim all the stocks..maybe 5% ..only if it’ll make you more sleep better..I just trimmed PLTR as it became too big a percentage in my portfolio..same with META..just added to NFLX after a trim at 1340…remember there is no correct answer..you are your own portfolio manager..and that’s cool 😎 it is all about right companies as long as business is selling well

Hi everyone, I’m looking to build a portfolio for long-term investing (around 5-10 years). What stocks or sectors do you think are good picks to hold for the long run? Looking forward to your suggestions!

My list right now is Microsoft | Amazon | Alphabet | ASML | Uber | Thermo Fisher | Visa | BYD , Xiaomi | Rolls-Royce | Pepsi | Waste Management

Maybe UNH, Novo
Google. They are keeping up with new trends and are always innovating. With their mass amounts of data, research team and overall dominance, they aren’t gonna fall behind.

ASTS Broadcom I think that is a good list. But maybe RDDT deserves a space there as the human layer of AI. The human element is likely to get really scarce as bots and AI take over the world.

1mja0rz,2025-08-06,"Msft stock and Open AI
Microsoft stock potential for 1/3 OpenAI ?

I rarely listen to fincl pods. Even though I should do it more. I'm quite sure I'm late to this comment.
On Dumb Money pod one of the guys said MSFT may be gifted/buy 1/3rd of Altmans OpenAI.
Is MSFT stock price already priced in this potential?

The pod also discussed Anthropic and how difficult it was for this guy to have opportunity to invest in it.

What are others doing to try to capture OpenAI opportunities?
I have $80k ready to invest above and beyond maxed retirement Accts and funds needed for my lifestyle.
If you’re asking if something you heard on a podcast is priced into the market you should be buying VOO You're thinking about it in the wrong way. 

Yes, OpenAI is planning to have an IPO at half a trillion dollars. Is it worth that much? What about when deepseek 2.0 comes out, will it be worth half a trillion? What about when China produces their 4th or 5th or 10th competitor to OpenAI, will OpenAI still be worth half a trillion? 

LLMs are just a commodity. Right now that perceived value is high, but as commodities go, the price goes up and down and up and down. And there will be other companies that enter into the market to offer real actionable competition, at lower prices. 

And I haven't even talked about whether open AI has monetized their product yet! 

Either way, whether MSFT ends up owning a piece of open AI or not, MSFT is well positioned to produce actual revenue in the coming AI revolution. Buy MSFT at any price with confidence. My problem is I’m worried they’ll get commoditised here. They could win through personalisation like what Spotify did. But Google has more data on you than OpenAI.

As for the question I’m not sure tbh. Maybe others can help with that. Where do others research?

Where do you find your information?  certain pods/financial news sources/youtube folks?

Are there any certain orgs/individuals you listen to (paid or free) for investment advice? 

Since I can't make this a one off post I'll comment here. The average investor already has plenty of AI exposure through google, Amazon, meta, nvidia & Microsoft making up a big chunk of indexes. If you want to pick stocks I would suggest reading Peter Lynch and sticking to domains you already know a lot about. I definitely understand and do hold voo in my retirement accounts and another taxed brokerage acct.
I definitely don't even know what questions to ask.
I'm probably more interested in how can the avg Joe/main Street investor invest in AI directly. The pod made comments that a $250mm fund they had couldn't get in on the funding round for anthropic I think.
That's when they brought up indirectly investing into Open AI and how msft is set to be leader in this.

1mj8uy7,2025-08-06,"[BRAINSTORMING/WISDOM OF THE CROWD] Investing in the AI echosystem using the 80/20 rule
I am trying to position myself to ride the wave of AI, and while I missed the NVDA boat (in NOV 2023 I thought I was too late, LOL), I have a few positions, but... these are my assumptions:

1. When it comes to innovation, newcomers always eat the incumbents' lunch. As much as  presently it feels like the Magnificents are the ones making all the gains.
2. I am a strong believe in the 80/20 rules, so I am trying to find the companies that constitute the 20% which will lead to 80% of AI gains
3. Let's leave NVDA out, shall we?

So, fellow redditors, which companies do you see constituting the core of the AI echosystem?  I see ASML, TSM, AMD... who else?  Especially smaller payers and not the GOOG & Co.

T.I.A.
The idea that ""when it comes to innovation, newcomers always eat the incumbents' lunch"" is simply untrue: Microsoft has been a great tech stock for the past 39 years after its 1986 IPO.

Some smaller companies in AI to consider are APLD, NBIS, and CRWV although the latter is disliked here > The idea that ""when it comes to innovation, newcomers always eat the incumbents' lunch"" is simply untrue:

Thank you for the suggestions, I have a long position on CRWV (I participated on the IPO). > Look into $PLTR, $SMCI, and some lesser-known LLM infrastructure plays real 80/20 potential there.

I have PLTR in my portfolio, and I am happy with it, but I am not sure it is part of that 20%. SMCI? Isn't that the company that is also hording BitCoins? That move turned me off.

1mj84e3,2025-08-06,"Is Qualcomm (QCOM) a buying opportunity?
Qualcomm is a semiconductor company that designs chips for connectivity and wireless connection. Their chips are used in phones, modems, cars, computers, and a wide variety of other things. Right now the worry is that they’re tied to Apple too much and are not diversified enough. 

However looking at the numbers about 25% of their total revenue was tied to Apple in 2022. Now it’s about 15%. Their Automotive and Internet of Things segments are currently experiencing significant double digit growth. It looks like their diversification strategy has been playing out well for them so far. 

As far as market valuation is concerned they currently trade at a 14 P/E ratio with a Forward P/E ratio of around 12. Their EV/EBITDA multiple is around 11 right now. Their financials are extremely healthy as well when you look at the balance sheet. 

Overall in a bull market buying opportunities can be few and far between and right now this looks like an opportunity. The company has solid earnings growth, trades at a low valuation, and their business strategy to diversify seems to be playing out well. 

 What are your guys thoughts around the stock?
QCOM looking juicy af at that P/E. Apple dependency fading, auto/IoT heating up. If market stays bullish, this is low-key a sleeper rocket. I live in San Diego and I know some people who work there. This is a sleeper rocket and the stock is highly manipulated. The level of manipulation is so much that it goes down after beating earnings. One person I met at a bar who works there told me they have major announcements and big deals to be disclosed but I’m too scared to put money into it considering their past 2 years record. I held for almost a year and sold for break-even I don't think it's a bad idea. It has always had a low valuation and I will say that while their automotive segment did have growth last quarter, semis are cyclical and autos are particularly so.

Is it reasonably priced (including vs 5 year average valuation)? Yeah. Could do reasonably well from here if you got a further uptick in these segments, but just know automotive will probably be a real negative when there's a downturn in that segment - see also: NXPI. Absolutely, took a decent position on it today Yeah IoT is next big thing imo. We'll talk to everything and manage everything so everything needs a chip to be controlled. If technology can make our lives easier and buy us some time, it has no cost.

President Donald Trump will announce that Apple Inc. will commit to spend another $100 billion on domestic manufacturing, the latest pledge by the tech giant to increase US production of its products as it seeks to avoid punishing tariffs on its flagship iPhones.

The announcement at the White House on Wednesday includes a new manufacturing program designed to bring more of Apple’s supply chain to the US, with an eye toward manufacturing additional critical components domestically, according to a White House official who detailed the announcement on the condition of anonymity.

1mj56fq,2025-08-06,"McDonald’s sees U.S. sales rebound, but concerns about low-income consumers linger
McDonald’s on Wednesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that topped analysts’ expectations as buzzy promotions helped its U.S. restaurants rebound.

Despite the chain’s improved performance this quarter, executives are still worried about the economic health of the low-income consumer. McDonald’s is working with its U.S. franchisees on ways to make its core menu items more affordable, beyond the $5 meal deal it rolled out last summer and the newer Daily Double burger promotion.

“Reengaging the low-income consumer is critical, as they typically visit our restaurants more frequently than middle- and high-income consumers,” CEO Chris Kempczinski told analysts on the company’s earnings conference call. “This bifurcated consumer base is why we remain cautious about the overall near-term health of the U.S. consumer.”

Executives said they anticipate that McDonald’s results will be stronger in the second half of the year, particularly as the chain faces easier comparisons in the fourth quarter to the fallout from last year’s E. coil outbreak.

Shares of the company rose more than 2% in morning trading.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** $3.19 adjusted vs. $3.15 expected
* **Revenue:** $6.84 billion vs. $6.7 billion expected

The fast-food giant reported second-quarter net income of $2.25 billion, or $3.14 per share, up from $2.02 billion, or $2.80 per share, a year earlier.

Excluding restructuring charges and other items, McDonald’s earned $3.19 per share.

Revenue rose 5% to $6.84 billion. Kempczinski credited the chain’s value, marketing and new menu items for the 6% increase in system sales during the quarter.

Same-store sales, a metric that only tracks the performance of restaurants that have been open at least a year, increased 3.8%, the chain’s biggest jump in nearly two years.

McDonald’s U.S. restaurants saw same-store sales growth of 2.5%, reversing two straight quarters of domestic declines. Kempczinski said the burger chain outperformed its rivals by both same-store sales and comparable traffic.

“Certainly, overall \[quick-service restaurant\] traffic in the U.S. remained challenging, as visits across the industry by low-income consumers once again declined by double digits versus the prior year period,” he said.

This quarter, the burger chain’s U.S. sales received a boost from a tie-in meal with the “Minecraft” movie and the launch of the McCrispy Chicken Strips.

Shortly after the quarter ended, Snack Wraps returned to menus for the first time in nine years; executives said that early results are “encouraging,” and franchisees have voted to maintain the $2.99 promotional price through the end of the year.

Outside the U.S., demand for its Big Macs and french fries was even stronger.

“I would just note, also on our international side, it’s not as competitive a market as it is in the U.S.,” Kempczinski said. “I think it’s a little bit easier for us to stand out and represent good value in international.”

The chain’s international developmental licensed markets division, which includes Japan and China, reported same-store sales growth of 5.6%.

Its international operated markets segment saw same-store sales growth of 4%, thanks to gains in markets like the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada. Executives said McDonald’s value and affordability scores from consumers have improved in key markets.

It boggles my mind how people
eat there often. I ate a really good costco steak last for the same price as mcdonald’s McDonald's has a habit of being in the right place at the right time. The land they have acquired over the years pretty much guarantees them footfall when the average citizen is most likely to be hungry with limited options. Low income earners not being able to afford McDonald’s is sad. Just put it on a credit card or split it into 20 different payments with klarna. Free food bro Companies like McDonald’s feed off of stupid people let’s be honest here. >“This bifurcated consumer base is why we remain cautious about the overall near-term health of the U.S. consumer.”

I mean ... yeah, the fact that ""bifurcated consumer base"" is a phrase pretty clearly shows the economic distress the working class is in right now. Yea so… I’m not coming back… ever unless $1 drink comes back, and some constant non app scam deal to get a couple of cheap sandwiches. I want to be full on $5 and with the quality they serve up I still feel like I’m being generous I live in a small town and I don’t get it. There’s a DQ, a McDonald’s, a pizza place, a Mexican restaurant, and 2 grocery stores. That’s the extent of our food options here aside from driving 20 minutes in to the nearby city. The grocery store is about 2 blocks from our McDonalds and has premade food for like half the price. If you’re hungry, and lazy, just go to the grocery store. It’s actually quicker because you can just walk in, grab the food, self checkout, and leave within a couple minutes.

Somehow, in this tiny ass Hicksville town, there’s always at least 3 cars in line at McDonald’s 1. McD is very app-centric now. So diners can get good deals via app offers and incentives. I work at a company that manages part of the martech stack they use to do this.

2. McD has a distinct flavor and taste and no other place offers it.

3. Real-estate location.

1mj54g2,2025-08-06,"Uber beats on revenue, announces $20 billion stock buyback
Uber reported second-quarter results on Wednesday that beat on revenue and announced the authorization of a $20 billion stock buyback.

Here’s how the company did versus analysts’ estimates compiled by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 63 cents vs. 63 cents expected.
* **Revenue:** $12.65 billion vs. $12.46 billion expected.

Here are the key segment numbers:

* **Mobility (gross bookings):** $23.76 billion, up 18% year over year
* **Delivery (gross bookings):** $21.73 billion, up 20% year over year

Uber’s revenue increased 18% from $10.7 billion a year earlier. For the quarter ending June 30, net income rose to $1.36 billion, or 63 cents per share, from $1.02 billion, or 47 cents per share, a year ago.

Gross bookings rose 17% to $46.8 billion, and the company reported adjusted earnings of $2.12 billion.

“At this point, we’re not seeing weakness in the consumer,” CEO Dara Khosrowshahi told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” Wednesday. “It’s steady as she goes, and for Uber, that’s great news.”

Uber’s “monthly active platform consumers” increased 15% to 180 million in the second quarter. The company said users booked around 3.3 billion trips during the period, up 18% from a year earlier.

>Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday evening is expected to host a group of top administration officials at his residence for a strategy session as the administration considers whether to release the transcript from the Department of Justice interview with Ghislaine Maxwell, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.

Normal things innocent people do After Apple inexplicably pumps 5% in the morning, the white house publicly says they won't be impacted by India tariffs? 

Life must be so easy as a US politician Shitty earnings for AI stocks AMD and SMCI? BULLISH FOR INDICES

More tariffs? BULLISH FOR INDICES

Job market falling apart? BULLISH FOR INDICES.

an asteroid could hit earth and kill 1 billion people and QQQ would still be up 1%.

God damn being a bear fucking sucks. Everyone who thinks these tariffs are bearish for stocks dont understand what he's really doing here. 

This is gonna be a huge boost to wallstreet when the dust settles, and main street will get boned. All the top companies will file in, kiss the ring, promise some obscure amount invested in America, and land tariff exemptions. 

This will undercut the small and medium players who cant buy an exemption. Sales will increasingly be driven into the largest cap companies, pushing stocks higher and destroying small businesses

It's morally reprehensible, but you arent going to save main street America by wasting money on puts Stocks saved by a company promising to spend a massive sum over an indeterminate period of time. Chill out bro, have you considered talking to a AI therapist about your problems? Sure is, but like all the other big numbers: is it real?

Oracle is the winner of all the LLM/AI bs. They are the middle man between the customer and developers (specifically: Google, anthropic, Amazon, xAI, and Meta). This is not an exaggeration---they literally profit off all of them. They are synthesizing it all for their customers, especially The Land of the Free™️. It's not just about making a giant melting pot, but they tailor it to the systems of the customers to interact seamlessly, with no lapse in operations. They've stuck themselves at the neck of the hourglass. If there's one thing you should know about economics, it's that that's where the real money is (think Nestlé). The concept is taking production market and the consumer market and the money flows through an hourglass shaped path. The money makes become so successful because they control that focal point, the bottle neck. They are the ""rent capturing elite"". Not only that, but the earnings are greatly underestimated. Delivery of their projects are ahead of schedule. The Stargate Team (colab of Sam Altman Chatgpt and Oracle) is a generational money opportunity.

Soft Bank in particular os betting big on oracle. The owner is a Japanese investor, and he's 117th richest billionaire. He's banking on this putting him in double digital place. 

They have earnings report in early September and the stock is on discount. 
It’s up 51% YTD and 99% on a rolling 12 months

What discount? Aren’t people using them because capacity is strained at the big 3 hyperscalers. If that growth slows they’ll be the first one to get cut? 

If anyone wants to correct me on this feel free to. [deleted] What kind of products from big tech in this context require to go thru oracle to get to the customer? 

Please don’t say oracle cloud. Your first sentence is hta orcle is winner of llm bs, but didnt explain why or how Was this written by someone who works at Oracle 😂 Also fyi Softbanks founder has made some really poor decisions lol. He invested into Wework lol. I don’t think that’s a strong bull case for Oracle imo lol. 

I think Oracle will be okay as long as Larry is alive imo. Bro basically spoke a lot without talking anything of substance about oracle or what it offers Everything.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

1mi465p,2025-08-05,"Is AAPL still a buy?
Compared to other companies such as Meta, Microsoft, or Google, it doesn’t seem like Apple’s stock growth has been that great lately. 

Now, it is widely known that Apple can afford to be slower to the AI game since people will use their devices regardless. But, it still seems like they are doing it very very slowly and not giving it as much urgency as other Big Tech companies. 

Nvidia and Microsoft recently overtook Apple as the world’s largest companies by market cap. 

Where does this go next, and will Apple slowly become smaller than even more companies, and will they collapse in the next 50 years or so?
Look less at AI and more on what future products can bring to the table. Will a foldable iPhone lead to significant growth? Will their services continue to expand? Can they innovate in their wearables department? Then make a decision. I’d argue that Apple is showing their forward thinking by not rushing headlong into the AI bubble, as we have begun to hear stories of companies who have rushed into AI seeing negative consequences.

Being first isn’t always best. Apple’s ability to navigate bubbles has always been why they are the gold standard of tech stocks. Are you kidding? If they are investing in AI, that means they get to say “AI” on all their earnings calls which is worth at least a 10% jump each quarter. i'm still confused what people think AI will ever do for Apple's earnings, even if they were amazing at it. it isn't going to move device sales. it certainly isn't for Google.

they're a consumer product company. they aren't selling gpus or data centers or an ad platform. yeah, they should have a better voice assistant by now, but it doesn't seem to matter to their earnings in a meaningful way. This will be an interesting read. Inverse reddit. 

Probably will never collapse with their insane market share and still good tech which people still love. I have a ton of apple devices at home: iPhones, iPads, HomePods, MacBooks, Apple TV, AirPods, watches etc.

But I don’t plan to replace any of them any time soon. I’m thinking of getting rid of my Apple Watch because it’s not very useful. I replace iPhones every 5 years or so, no reason to do it more often. I haven’t seen anything exciting in the last few years.

And now with different courts forcing Apple to allow other payment methods, their revenue from services will not grow as fast anymore.

I don’t see much growth for Apple. They don’t produce enterprise software, so I think new Siri and other AI features will not draw a lot of new revenue. Gaming on Macs can gain some traction but I don’t think it’ll be significant. Vision Pro is a bust. What else is there? Apple plays the long game. They weren't first with smartphones or tablets either, but dominated when they entered. Their cash reserves are massive and customer loyalty is unmatched. I wouldn't bet against them just because they're not rushing AI features. When they do release something, it'll probably work better than competitors' first attempts. Apple has leveraged a 2nd mover advantage many times. AirPods dominates the headphone market, after buying beats no less lol. Their smart watch owns the whole watch business. Apple TV and Apple Music still growing. Don’t discount Apple just yet. I honestly think Apple sitting out the AI investment race and just licensing mature software when it’s ready is a great move with how behind they are. 


Problem is you’d expect the difference in capital to go to R&D for other technology and it seems like that’s not the case for them. They’re a fine company but their PE is high for how little they’re trying to grow.

1mhsdl6,2025-08-04,"Snap DD for Earnings
Snap will beat earnings. 

Google and Meta have traditionally captured share and posted 10+% and 20+% growth consistently.

This often came at the expense of other players but I think the display ad market has grown quite a bit this year.

Even MSFT's advertising grew 20% plus compare to ~10% for the same quarter last year. Roku and TTD posted ~20% gain as well. 

Unless the folks at SNAP are completely lacking in their GTM strategy, I think there will be a surprise when it comes to advertising earnings. 

Position: ~$600 bet on Aug 8, 10.5 calls; meagre, I know but disclosure is important 
I've bought shares but they have deep problems at snap . Theyre unprofitable.

Last q net loss was 140k  but they had a 257k 'sale and purchase of stock ' expense which if they haven't done something similar will see them in the green .

If they can make a net profit Q2 with good guidance then we may see a significant bump . [deleted] Great prediction 🤣

SNAP has been a garbage company for so long now. You deserve to lose money on this for not understanding the vast difference between the companies you’re comparing lmfaoo

They haven’t been able to hold down a legit advertiser literally ever. Lolol glad you’re not too worried about it. Better luck next gamble Predicting revenue wrecks estimates and comes in the 1.5+ range.  Not much growth this quarter but guidance should be up for next quarter.  Hoping they don't have lower US numbers though. gaap unprofitability is isn’t the issue, no one cares about that. they are fcf positive and have positive opex cash flows which is more important. everyone backs out sbc anyways which is why they’re in the “red” but not really

1mhic22,2025-08-04,"The PermaBulls have been right all along, and perhaps my brain is the smoothest of them all.
I have been firmly in the bear camp for 1/2 decade.

My post history will outline many of the reasons why, but I think I've finally had to come to accept that this market will never see the likes of a massive, dot com, global financial crisis style correction ever again.

A global pandemic that shut the world down couldn't do it (SPY found a new high within 6 months).

Global conflict cannot do it -- the world is as to nuclear war as it's been since the collapse of the USSR.

Ridiculous valuations cannot do it -- The SPY is trading at a P/E that was only higher during dot com, GFC, and for one quarter after COVID hit -- at any point in the last 125+ years.

Bank failures cannot do it -- The failures of signature bank, silicon valley bank, and first republic banks, by assets under management, were larger than all the bank failures combined of the +/- 450 banks that failed in 08.

Rising delinquency rates in auto loans and credit card debt, paired with the highest balances on consumer debt in history have no effect.

A failing commercial real estate sector has no impact.

High interest rates, paired with an unaffordability crisis in the housing sector, means that a majority of Americans can no longer afford to buy a home... irrelevant.

Global trade wars that tank the market 20% only have the ability to hold that price action for 4 months before the market finds new highs.

No my friends -- I think the time has finally come for me to eat my words. To throw caution out the window. To say f\*ck the news, TA, historical precedence, or any individual smell test.

There is only one thing you need to know to get rich in the new age of markets.

maybe this time is truly different. As someone in Texas right now, I don't think I've ever seen a Confederate flag displayed along side an Obama sticker or any other democrat.

1mhbufy,2025-08-04,"Basically for ACHR to run, everything has to line up
As someone who’s been holding ACHR through the ups and downs, this week’s 14% drop didn’t shake me. Sentiment across eVTOLs is clearly cooling off after the hype wave earlier this year & Archer’s still pre revenue, which means every move is amplified. No news from the company, just light volume & some options hedging

JPMorgan raised their price target from $9 to $10 but still kept a Neutral rating. They flagged cash burn and delays in revenue as key risks (nothing new) & called the recent market behavior *irrational exuberance.* Not wrong, but a PT bump is still a bullish tell

They also don’t expect Trump’s executive order *(which explicitly supports advanced air mobility)* to impact earnings soon but let’s be real, that kind of policy shift helps the long term narrative.

Technicals are a mixed bag right now. MACD shows a buy, but 20 day and 50 day EMAs are still above the current price, so short term traders are treating this like a downtrend. Doesn’t change my thesis.

The stock is still trading with speculative energy, but that’s how early-stage bets work. Analysts are still leaning bullish with a “Moderate Buy” consensus & a $11.92 PT *(almost 24% upside from here).*

For ACHR to rerate higher, they’ll need to deliver clean earnings, show progress on certification milestones, and eventually break into revenue territory. Until then, volatility is just part of the package.

If you’re in from $12+, sure, that hurts. But sub $10 is a zone I’ll keep nibbling. Not saying it moons tomorrow, but I’d rather build a position now than chase it later on a surprise catalyst
Just out of curiosity, how do you explain Joby's rise over the last month? JOBY has been and will continue to be ahead of Archer.

Tesla's (TSLA.O), opens new tab sales of China-made electric vehicles in July fell 8.4% from a year earlier, reversing a mild increase in June, in the face of rising competition from rivals offering lower-priced new models.

Wedbush reiterated an outperform rating and a price target of $160 for Palantir stock ahead of its earnings, according to a recent research note.

""We continue to believe that Palantir’s unique AI software approach will be a positive growth catalyst as governments look to further increase efficiency with more software/lower headcount,"" Ives wrote.

1mgq1b5,2025-08-03,"Is Jerome Powell doing the right thing by holding rates higher for longer?
Jerome Powell absolutely knows the labor market is weakening under the surface, but he’s jawboning intentionally when he keeps saying “the labor market is strong” and the “Economy is solid.”

There is no way Powell can truthfully say the labor market is strong when:

Leading economic indicators continue to plummet.

Quits rate is the Lowest since 2020 (shows workers don’t feel confident to switch jobs).

Job openings (JOLTS) Down 30%+ from 2022.

Temp employment which is a Leading recession signal; already rolling over.

Part-time employment is Declining, often a softening sign.

Initial + Continuing claims Trending higher for months.

Massive revisions in non-farm payrolls show we are near stall speed and at risk of loosing jobs on a monthly basis 

We know Powell tracks all these LEADING indicators, but he keeps focusing on Lagging indicators like the headline U-3 unemployment rate as an excuse to keeps rates higher for longer. But the problem is when Jerome finally see’s degradation in these lagging indicators, the recession will already be underway and it will be too late. And that appears to be okay with him.

On the other hand, If Powell admits the labor market is cracking then…

-Bond yields plummet

-Stocks rally

-Financial conditions loosen

Which undoes his entire inflation-fighting narrative, which is clearly his #1 priority with unknown inflation effects from tariffs looming. 

Powell is managing psychology, not just data. Admitting weakness too early and then having inflation re-accelerate (via tariffs, services, housing) would destroy his credibility. He’d rather look “late” than prematurely ease and risk a 1970s-style stagflation repeat.

Powell is playing a high-stakes communication game. He knows the cracks are forming. He’s just not ready to say it out loud, yet.

The Fed’s Nightmare Scenario: Premature Easing

Powell’s #1 fear isn’t a shallow recession, it’s:

1. Easing too early which results in Financial conditions loosen

2. Inflation re-accelerates, Especially via core services, housing, tariffs

3. The Fed loses credibility, Then has to hike again (1970s Volcker trap)

He would rather:

-Be late

-Let the economy contract

-Cut hard and swift once the damage is visible in the lagging indicators.

Powell is executing a deliberate strategy of delayed response, knowing that:

1. The small chance that the labor doesn’t break, He wins, no need to cut.

2. The more likely case that the labor does break, He cuts hard and fast, accepting the recession.

It’s not that he believes a recession is avoidable. It’s that he’s accepting recession risk in exchange for inflation control.

So the ultimate question is, if you think we should be trying to avoid a recession altogether and that tariff induced inflation is transitory in nature, then the Fed should already be cutting and Jerome Powell is Indeed “too late.” 

However, if you think it’s more important to guarantee that inflation is 100% completely stamped out for good, and that it’s worth the risk of having a recession to guarantee that, then the Fed is correctly keeping rates higher for longer. 
You don’t want to be chasing inflation AND jobs. The economy sinking and having high inflation before you even lower interest rates is a recipe for disaster. Stagflation is pretty terrible.


He’s doing the right thing. If these tariffs weren’t in place we likely would have had a rate cut by now. First, it’s the FOMC not Powell. He’s 1/12 votes. I think 10/12 voted to hold. 

Up until this point, probably? Hard to tell, but inflation was at 2.7% and the jobs reads were decent until last week. But now we have tariffs hitting and jobs softening quickly, including significant updates to prior months. 

Their job just got MUCH harder. Stagflation in the back half of the year would suck but starting to look likely? Its the tariffs dude. Nonsense taxation of the people because corporates and capitals doesnt want to pay for them. The trouble is Trump, by trying interfere with the fed, has made it much harder for the fed to lower rates lest they be seen to capitulating to political influence. This means that, given ambiguous data, the fed has to err on the side of keeping rates higher for longer. Yes, Powell is the adult in this row.  He is wise to hold the line of lower interest rates until inflation is under control, which it definitely is not now, as result of the tariffs. Yes I would like to add that unemployment is still low, if FOMC gets data in Sept that economy is definitely going into serious slowdown, they can simply cut rates by 100bps, it's kind of a moot point for all the bullying to get 25bps cut each month without enough data and lots of uncertainty due to tariffs.

Another point: Tariffs will make prices go up if economy is not in slowdown at that point and there is labor shortage, it can lead to price-wage spiral, which can lead to high inflation for long time unless rates are raised.

FOMC is playing this perfectly, wait until we know the effect of tariffs on inflation, let the price rise dissipate and get absorbed by lower demand from consumer due to them cutting back. And then cut rates to help the economy, rise in cost of good will become a one time thing, most likely the system will be stable in 2-3 months assuming they don't fool around with tariffs again. Tariffs are just another form of sales tax and sales tax disproportionately affects the lower class.  This doesn't punish us companies it punishes consumers. ECB lowered rates as late as June since they had largely been able to bring inflation down to their target of 2%.

US would have been on a similar track if tariffs hadn't  been put in place, causing lot of uncertainty and rise in inflation for US.

1mgm7st,2025-08-03,"Atlassian (TEAM) Rovo + Vertical Ecosystem Be Its Moment?
I’m thinking about whether Atlassian’s AI-powered Rovo, tied to its vertically integrated ecosystem, could spark an “iPod moment” like Apple’s in 2003. Back then, Apple was a niche PC player, and the iPod + iTunes ecosystem made them a consumer titan. Atlassian’s in a similar spot strong with its interconnected suite (Jira, Confluence, Trello, Bitbucket) used by 83% of Fortune 500, but middle-tier against Microsoft, ServiceNow, and GitLab.


Rovo’s an AI platform baked into Atlassian’s tightly knit ecosystem, connecting Jira (dev), Confluence (docs), Trello (tasks), and Bitbucket (code) with third-party tools like Slack and Google Drive. Its unified search pulls contextual data across these tools, Rovo Chat answers queries with company-specific insights, and Rovo Agents automate tasks like backlog cleanup or code reviews. It’s powered by the Teamwork Graph (20+ years of workflow data) and free for Premium/Enterprise users.


Could Rovo’s integration with Atlassian’s vertical system where tools share data and workflows seamlessly be a game changer? It tackles pain points of work time spent searching. Rovo’s no-code agents let teams customize workflows, keeping them in Atlassian’s orbit, much like iTunes locked users into Apple’s ecosystem.


Microsoft’s Copilot and ServiceNow’s AI are tough competitors with bigger ecosystems. And B2B sales cycles are slower than the iPod’s consumer boom. Atlassian’s open integrations, unlike Apple’s walled garden, might limit lock-in. What do you think? Can Rovo make Atlassian the enterprise AI leader, or is it just another feature?

How are they still unprofitable and wtf is with that share dilution? Needs new management Very few organizations use Atlassian's whole stack. You might have Jira, maybe with Confluence, but rarely are you also on Bitbucket and Trello in the way you're proposing here.

There's significant overlap and some of their tools aren't seen as on par with the best in class or especially good for fringe cases. I'm sure it's nice to say you'll search git commit notes, but that's not something most people want to do.

So it could be a handy tool that people use if they want to search Confluence. Yes, that could make Confluence a better bet against some of the other options there.

But is it a great multiplier where companies will buy the whole stack to have unified search. Probably not. Their pricing isn't very friendly to that approach and most of the other tools in this space are working on similar search and query solutions. View it as a double edge. When you have mag 7s paying out 9 figure compensation packages, they have to pay up to get top talent. I've worked at 3 different companies that use Atlassian. JIRA and Confluence were used at all 3, but not Trello at any. And only 1 used Trello.

1mg3amk,2025-08-02,"Wash Sale Confusion
Hi all, I'm seriously confused about the 30 days prior part, regarding the wash sale rule. I see a lot of stuff like this, when I google, or use AI: 

*Adhere strictly to the 30-day rule
Do not repurchase the same security or any ""substantially identical"" security within the 61-day wash sale window. This period includes 30 days before the sale, the day of the sale, and 30 days after the sale.
The safest approach is to avoid repurchasing the exact same stock or security within this window.*

but how the heck do you ""repurchase"" something in the past? The *30 days after* part makes perfect sense to me, just not the 30 days before part. From what I understand, it doesn't matter if I bought shares a year ago, or yesterday--it's still going to trigger a wash sale, if I sell those shares at a loss today, and buy back within the next 30 days...correct? Any clarity appreciated!
[deleted] i disagree. it stops people from creating fake losses to save on taxes. The rule is prohibiting you from performing a wash sale *prophylactically*.  You can’t lock in losses by selling IBM on December 1 and then buying it back on December 2. Nor can you lock in those same losses by buying IBM on November 30 using money from, say, a 1-day loan, and taking the loss the next day. i wish someone explained it to me like this when i was learning This may have already been said but this whole issue really goes back to people selling stocks at the end of the year to harvest capital losses they would use toward their taxes and then buy the same stock back in January. So basically the Wash Sale Rule is there to prevent that or similar paper losses. But as others have said you shouldn’t make trading decisions solely on some concern to avoid the rule applying to your trades. Don’t avoid buying or selling if you think that’s the right thing to do. I wouldn't worry about it too much. The 30 days prior is to just prevent people from purchasing first and then try to claim a loss. It only disallows getting the loss for that year, but that loss will still attach to your remaining lots (delaying the loss pretty much) gotcha, I ran a couple scenarios through AI and I think I have a bit better understanding. Interestingly it sounds like you have to track it share by share--not as I previously thought, where you would just spread the loss evenly across all newly acquired shares. Anyway, I don't typically layer, so I either sell all or none--so I think the ""before"" 30 days case won't apply to me. I think :) I think I understand now, the *30 days before* part is referring to if you buy a 2nd lot (or odd lot)--so you're holding 2 of the same lot for a few days--then you sell the original lot at a loss. That sound right? Say I have 100 shares of company X. It drops 30% and I decide to buy more but want to wait a bit. Then 2 weeks later, I sell the lot I first purchased to get losses of the 30% realized. Then I buy in 2 weeks because it drops another 10%. Except I can't realize those losses and my cost basis for the 2nd purchase lot gets readjusted.

Y’all,
Google is under investigation from DOJ or EU I think. Not sure if they are still ongoing or what not. If so, does anyone know when they conclude the investigation? I just want to know if they are still being investigated or they already got slapped with fine or penalty. OR, the expected outcome or estimated conclusion by when? I am interested in buying but I would like to know these timelines before getting my feet wet. Thanks!
Could be years, could never come to fruition, could be put to bed by trump  TLDR, the Court has ruled that Google is a monopoly on search in Aug 2024. What we’re waiting for now is not the ruling but the remedies. Currently  there are some proposals like selling Chrome, banning Google from paying Apple for being the default search engine,… Remedy is supposed to be finalized by Aug 2025.
There is another anti-trust trial going on about Ad business though, but it has not been ruled I believe The ""remedy"" is competition in the form of ChatGPT lol. This case is total bullshit. Google succeeded because they had the best product, there is nothing wrong with that Google is being weighed down by antitrust and perception AI is a threat to their search business. They will eventually bounce back. The ones kind of in trouble now are Amazon, Apple, Tesla. Amazon is losing AWS share, Apple hasn’t grown in 3 years, and Tesla’s sales are falling. No one cares about TSLA last time I checked lol The ruling for the anti-trust remedies is expected soon (I think this month). A full break-up is extremely unlikely however Google will likely be banned from paying Apple and other phone manufacturers a fee for making Google Search the default option. This will likely mean some Apple users (a very small portion) choosing a different Search Engine however overall most Apple users (including myself) will keep Google as the default Search option. Overall the impact to Alphabet's profitability should be fairly negligible because Alphabet will no longer pay an estimated $20 billion a year to Apple for being the default Search option and this saving will also likely be more than the loss of revenue due to some Apple users selecting a different Search Engine.

Lithium price & Stocks are in a bottom of the cycle. Sure the cycle bottom could take another 1-3 years and i think the 2022 peaks will never be seen again there is room for better conditions ahead. There will be a time where new mines are actually being built and the related micro caps will thrive. 

Which mines (hard rock and brine) have the best chances to being financed & built?

In Europe I think European Metals Holdings (part of politically becoming Independent).

In the US I think Surge Battery Metals (big hard rock deposit). 

Which ideas do you have and why?
LAC hit 15 a few years ago just on permitting news, it's currently at 2.50 and Thacker Pass starts production in 2027. I'm loading up as much as I can. I'm building a position in LAC.

Many larger companies and countries have infrastructure and/or dependency on lithium, so it is not going away soon.  Using batteries for utilities and homes is likely to accelerate in the near future (10 or so year). I believe they are going to stick with the proven tech for now (lithium-ion).

Because it's a hot tech company and employees aren't allowed to sell Ligma balls Figma is a product that interestingly is an absolute powerhouse household name for everyone that’s in the tech industry, but completely unknown to everyone outside of it.

So some people are here scratching their heads about “wtf is Figma” while others are puzzled about how anyone could possibly not know what Figma is. It’s like the Microsoft Word of web development and has been for years now.

My only curiosity is where do they go from here? They seem to already have such market dominance that the only way it could go now is down. Like buying the stock of a company at its peak popularity. The bull case is that they use their market dominance to continue innovating and expanding what they can offer.

1mfs0p4,2025-08-02,"Berkshire Hathaway operating earnings dip 4% as conglomerate braces for tariff impact

Berkshire Hathaway reported an operating profit of $11.16 billion for the second quarter, down 4% from the same period last year. The drop was largely due to weaker results in its insurance underwriting business. Despite that, other segments including railroads, energy, manufacturing, services, and retail posted higher profits compared to a year ago


EPS down 36% Year Over Year,
Revenue down 1% Year Over Year,
EPS down 23% Quarter Over Quarter,
Revenue up 3% Quarter Over Quarter,


I think Berkshire will probably struggle a little during this post-Buffett transition (down 13% since the Buffett's retirement announcement), but the business is in good shape for the future. This is my punishment for buying a profitable company They’re down since Buffett is retiring rather than the business itself struggling. Investors want Abel to prove himself as CEO. One of the few companies calling it like it is (i.e, they aren't bullshitting the tariff impact talking points out of fear). I know, I can't believe I overlooked value opportunities like Palantir and Carvana Abel needs to be Abel to a degree. Sort of like Tim Cook. He’s not going to be Buffett. Nor should he try to be. I see it as an opportunity for Berkshire.  down It's a boomer stock and that's why I like it. Boomers don't panic sell.

This and Waste Management are my favorites. No because you overpaid > Baby Berk (BRKB) has a p/e of 13.

I read a news feed today that stated our energy bills will increase moving forward ""due to increased energy demands due to AI"". In other words, we are helping Meta Msft Goog & Amzn pay their bills. This country is hilarious. Those companies have enough money to pay their own bills. Rich people keep making laws that make them richer and it's just scary that we can't do a single thing about it. As a naturalized citizen from another country, where you think corruption doesn't exist in the USA, then you're here and it's just a whole other flavor of corruption, instead of outright killing.

Millions of jobs were created and filled, wages have skyrocketed, trust the great leader, just look at North Korea's numbers, they are tremendous! I've been looking at it coupled with the really bad GDP growth from Q1 (-0.5).  The Q1 numbers were terrible in large part because of higher than normal imports caused by front running the tariffs. The Q2 is probably extra high because the lack of imports. 

Average the two out and you get a pretty anemic economy, about 1.25% growth annualized out. Some of the soft indicators are pretty bad too. Vegas has seen tourism drop (though s good chunk of that is explained by the precipitous drop in Canadian tourism) and the freight recession easing into a freight depression. We lost a few more trucking companies last week. 

I think this gives JPow ammo to cut because for the first time we've acknowledged a weak labor market and half of the dual mandate kicks in. The consensus now is for a September cut.

1mfk16k,2025-08-02,"Microsoft finally revealed Azures true revenue. What do we all think?
Microsoft used to bundle all kinds of other devices like O365, server licenses, etc. into their “Intelligent Cloud” segment, muddying comparisons with AWS and GCP. Looks like this time, they finally caved and reported numbers. The growth always looked sus to me in the real world given everyone anecdotally swears by AWS and I know very few who use Azures compute or data infrastructures. 

Azure made $75B in the year, apparently growing 34% YoY. GCP is at $50B and AWS is at $111B. AWS has a sizable 32% lead over Microsoft here. 

AWS is also growing 18% and accelerating. But if we assume it stays at say 20% and Azure stays at 35%, it’s catching up by 15% a year. Applying simple compounding, this means Azure will take 3-4 years to reach parity with AWS around the $200B mark. 

Satya is super strategic. Why would he reveal Azure numbers now? Many analysts think it’s because Azure only recently showed that it has a shot of catching AWS due to OpenAI demand. Microsoft is paying openAI which is then paying Microsoft back for using azure compute. 

The future of cloud dominance is all going to come down to openAI carrying Azure growth vs the strength of their combined competitors like Anthropic, llama, Gemini, etc. Anthropic already has better models for some use cases. GPT is also not exclusive to Microsoft and already available on GCP. 

This is not even getting into profitability. We don’t know if Azure is profitable with the AI workloads. Microsoft hasn’t reported those numbers yet. But we do know AWS is printing money and has been even before AI. 

This is going to be an interesting 3 years. I think AI models are increasingly reaching parity. So if there’s no competitive advantage between them, I fully expect AWS to retain and even expand their lead as they simply offer a better product, prices, experience and support. 

 
I wouldn't over-index on OpenAI carrying Azure. Sure it is compute-intensive, but it will be a drop in the ocean vs all the other companies renting their servers, databases and services.

Microsoft is in almost every single organisation in some form or another. That will be a LOT more spend than OpenAI alone. I'm surprised that GCP is that close to Azure. MS is very strong outside of the US. Here in Poland it’s almost as if cloud means Azure. Sure there are alternatives, yes AWS is trying to make a foothold, yes Google is paying handsomely for carving out some space, then there are many European and local competitors that also make a living. But you can’t easily defy the great head start that MS had in Europe. So while AWS is king in US, MS rules everywhere else. Buy more MSFT. I mean, that’s just your anecdote. I’m a cloud engineer working at a consulting company and we have lots of massive customers with millions of spend per year in azure doing very interesting stuff. Yeah. One website using 2-3 services. Try thousands of applications currently using every possible service. 

A small shop or a shop that committed to containers can treat cloud as commodity. 

A big enterprise that went all in with a cloud provider 8-10 years ago is a lot harder to unwind. Your simple compounding is too simple. The revenue gap between them is $35B now.  If they have the same growth rates next year, Microsoft will reduce that gap by $5B. That difference will not been achieved in four years. Cloud is ultimately a commodity. Personally, I’m bullish on Jassey nodding at potentially diverting attention to other parts of Amazon’s business and exploring other verticals.

1mfeif2,2025-08-02,"Comparing ETFs and long term growth funds
I’m trying to get a general idea of the long term growth ETFs and index funds people are talking about.

What percent of your total stock portfolio would you invest in it?

How do I choose between VOO, VGT, SPY or SCHG?
Diversification. VT contains every public company in the world, weighted by market cap. It automatically adjusts as various companies/industries/countries grow and shrink. It's a set and forget long term hold. 100% VT here SCHG. Slightly more aggressive than VOO and less aggressive than the tech-focused funds. Good balance. Anyone giving you answers based on this post alone is doing you a disservice. 

Age, time horizon, immediate / long term investment goals, risk tolerance ect are all important to note. Specifically the first two. I have a huge amount of VTI.  I went with that over VT.  VTI is probably 20 percent of my account.  It’s overweighted for sure.  From there I have other sectors like emerging markets, tilted small and med caps. Then just individual dividend paying stocks. Why did you choose it over the other options? VTI is at the core of my 4 fund portfolio and is 40% of the total. It's hard to argue with, it's time tested and well diversified. Thousand percent. Out performs it all. I almost want to just get VT and call it a day.  But I already have the black rock emerging and developing market ETFs that cover that.  Every big dip day I buy 5 shares of VTI. Ah, so it’s even more set and forget than the others. 

I guess if I want to take a slight risk I could split between VT and a strictly US based one. You could.

1mez7fx,2025-08-01,"Is hiring someone to invest your money the best hands-off approach?
I know I want to invest, and I want to start investing early. I've heard a little bit about what you should invest in but quite frankly it all goes in one ear and out the other because I'm not personally that interested in learning more and it bores me. Should I look into a professional and trust them with my money? Is there one specific thing that I can invest in? 

I'd prefer safety, I'm working a full time and a part time job and have a good bit of savings that I'm willing to invest. I'm thinking maybe a 60% safe investments, 10% risky and the rest in savings? 

PS. I know reddit probably isn't where you should be trusting your money, but Google doesn't give you one solid answer, nor can I ask questions if I have them so that's why I'm asking here.
why pay someone when you can easily do it yourself for free - put that money in VOO and watch it grow Just put it all into a basic boring ETF like VT and be done with it.  You should never have someone else managing your money. Statistically, financial advisors do not beat the S&P. Pick VTI and/or VOO, and just invest yourself. DCA every two weeks and move on. SPY or VOO is already that pretty much. Don’t pay someone to do this for you The benefit of a financial advisor isn’t beating the market. It’s for keeping as much of your gains as possible when it’s time to retire.

Even the relatively low volume of the MI350 ($25K) is likely to boost Q3 and Q4 results, especially considering that they will be compared to a period when China's exports were hit hard. Margins could also improve: shifting more of the GPU portfolio to higher-end SKUs will help close AMD's earnings gap with Nvidia and Broadcom - which still limits AMD's P/E ratio.



The market expects AMD's GPU revenue to be around $1.65 billion in the third quarter. If MI355X grows as expected in the second half of the year and prices move in line with expectations, AMD's revenue could be revised upward.



Major customers could be behind this move 

AMD wouldn't be pressing prices so aggressively unless major cloud service providers such as Meta ( META ) and Oracle ( ORCL ) were on board. There is growing evidence that these customers are no longer just interested in AMD's GPUs, but are actually actively deploying them. We saw early signs of this in our Q1 earnings call and earnings filings. Customers appear to be buying AMD's complete AI platform, including ROCm, system integration and long-term support.



AMD vs. Nvidia: The Price Gap is Narrowing 

Even at $25K, the MI350 is less expensive than Nvidia's B200, making AMD an attractive choice for workloads such as inference, especially among enterprises and second-tier cloud service providers that can't justify Nvidia's pricing. This creates an optimal balance of “value and performance,” and AMD is helping to lead the way in certain market segments. This marks a significant shift in the competitive landscape.



Risks remain, but the narrative is changing 

Headwinds remain. China's export restrictions could result in a revenue reduction of \~$800 million in the second half of 2025, and it is unclear if or when licenses will resume. mi355x needs to be released smoothly and continue the momentum of mi350 - any issues with the software or system will be closely watched. rocm is still lagging behind CUDA in developer adoption. Still lagging behind CUDA in terms of adoption, but improving: ROCm now offers day one support for LLaMA 4 and there are over 2 million models optimized for AMD GPUs on Hugging Face.



Overall 

This indicates a shift in AMD's strategy. It supports our broader view that the company is no longer confined to the role of low-cost alternative, but is moving towards leadership in AI computing. If these pricing trends continue - and especially if they trigger even a modest “ahead-of-the-curve” cycle - the market may begin to reassess AMD as less of a traditional chipmaker and more of a AMD as less of a traditional chipmaker and more of a platform company. As these fundamentals strengthen, the technological breakthroughs we've seen from AMD, especially relative to NVIDIA, could begin to gain real staying power.
As an AMD shareholder, all of these AMD pump postings lately are making me nervous. Bro should i buy or not i have 2 dollars  At this point a bot should delete these amd posts if they don't include explanation for how amd deals with cuda. No amd bull answers that or even understands the question, makes me think they are dumb money don’t risk it AMD has ROCm which is their open source platform AMD’s financials on Tuesday are irrelevant. OP just said AMD is set to report $1.65B in quarterly GPU revenue. Nvidia is doing $1.65B in GPU sales every 3 days. What the market wants to know is AMD’s GPU guidance. In their last earnings call, Lisa Su said they do “tens of billions in the coming years” but wouldn’t guide for this year. If she can give strong guidance for 2H 2026 and/or 2027 then we are off to the races. Just sold 35% of my holdings today. Might regret it but made 60% pretty fast... Same. Probably time to sell lol

1mest36,2025-08-01,"How come Azure manages to still grow 33%, while GCP 32% (1/3 of size) and AWS only 17%
My question is if they are doing some shady reporting or are they really that good? For example Openai uses azure credits that still msft pays. A company that I know received 1 billion in azure credits in exchange of shares in the company. Are these counted in the 33% growth that msft pays? Wouldn't it be wrong? Msft using the cloud resources themselves in exchange for some paper notes in a startup that might never take off, but the cloud grew 33%...
[deleted] Microsoft has a huge leverage due to existing windows installations.

 For companies which want to move to the cloud and are almost entirely Windows and office based applications, azure is the easiest/laziest choice. But it’s a growth rate, so why are Teams, Outlook, and other products growing so much that we get 33% growth for the whole bucket? Microsoft Outlook isn’t exactly a hot new growing product Outlook, teams etc are essential for enterprises. I get the growth. 

AWS is also essential but with Microsoft, you get basically everything you need in one place. Like literally everything that you need for your large or small business. From the perspective of administration then Microsoft will always win, aws sells it self as the dev friendly option, gcp is for hipsters, and azure is the IT guys choice. Sure but it’s extremely integrated with the most prolific enterprise business stack that has ever existed. Those are growth percents I don’t mean to say either is a bad business or not growing. That all-in-one Enterprise model is huge for Microsoft and is a big advantage for Azure. But the person I’m responding to thinks MS is using Office and Outlook as an accounting trick to juice Azure’s growth, which is nonsense. Outlook and Teams are a big part of Microsoft’s value proposition, but the idea that they’re artificially DOUBLING the revenue growth of Cloud is just moronic. Adding in 30 year old products won’t make your 10-year old 20% CAGR product sector go from 17% growth to 33% Is there something anti competitive about pioneering technology? Are companies not allowed to make more than one product?

I don’t see how you can possibly stipulate an unfair advantage solely from the fact that their products are complimentary to each other lol 

The fact that these other platforms even exist in the context of windows is just proof that it’s a competitive market. “Winning” is not illegal.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1mer2ky,2025-08-01,"Google stock and its future
Indeed, Google did a remarkable job in Q2, and its search business is doing well even though it faced existential threats from LLM. But I thought it would do well and eventually cross 200 USD and seem like a solid, well-diversified business. Therefore, I bought a few shares of Google at $197.  Even though my average for Google is 187, as I bought some shares earlier when it was in the 178-182 range, now it feels like buying some shares at 197 was a mistake, and I should have waited longer. 

It seems to be sliding down, and they will face some lawsuits regarding illegal search business monopoly soon. Now, the question is how it will impact Google's business in the future. Does that still hold if it gets some bad outcome, for instance, the new law may require them to sell Chrome, or Google can not be the default search engine? Will it still hold after the lawsuit outcome?
You bought a few days ago and now you're down and complaining ?

And you consider yourself a long-term investor ?

Get out of here. It just shows you have no idea what you're really doing.

If you truly understood the company you would have been happy it dropped so you could buy more. The fact that you're worried tells me you don't actually understand Google and are just throwing money around for a quick buck. 🤡 Why did you buy the shares then haha Zoom out it just macro Eventually is a long time, and I’m sure eventually it will cross 200 and probably 500 and most likely split when it hits 1000 and it’ll be 100 again. OP - I would assume you bought google after doing research, with their strong recent earnings reports, and a well diversied business. Also knowing the legal case is hanging over them. I personally bought at $170 and even if it goes down, I know their long term outlook is bright. They are a monster.

In the last 3 years Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook and Google has spent close to a TRILLION DOLLARS on AI.

How much profit have they made from AI? Close to nothing.

Look at Microsoft. Co-pilot has basically been bolted on to Office. Then Microsoft jacked up the price. But would people actually pay for Co-pilot on its own? Most probably not. So Microsoft can brag this is AI revenue when we know the reality is people are being forced to buy co-pilot to have Office.

Even if we assume people want to pay for co-pilot it’s revenue is microscopic compared to the amount of money Microsoft is paying for AI. 

We see similar weak AI revenue streams from Google, Facebook and Amazon.

There's a series of big houses in Seattle's Capitol Hill area where they go all out for Halloween. Many houses are known for giving out full size candy bars. 6-7 years ago, we go trick or treating with a big group of kids and my friend points to a guy opening the door with a big bowl of candy. Andy Jassy.

These were not full size candy bars. I knew then that the guy didn't have it. Fucker. Amazon is investing hundreds of billions into replacing it's entire workforce with robots. Once this is fully up and running, profit margins will go through the roof. Premium quality DD right here Their cloud business is far more important than retail and logistics business. They have made a bet on Anthropic to carry them in AI and are betting heavily on their Trainium AI accelerators. I’m not sure this is the right strategy. Depends on execution really. Right now Azure growing at 39% and Google Cloud growing at 32% compared to AWS at 18%. It will be fine. This upcoming generation has been raised on Amazon. The company isn’t going anywhere and they have exposure to AI, Robotics, cloud, ad revenue, streaming services, etc. The big thing driving growth the last 4-5 years was AI and they are not a driver like some of the other tech companies are. Along with that they are facing increasing competition on all fronts, retail and cloud. Before it was the Temu/Shein but now also Walmart is making inroads. Both Azure and GCP are making gains in cloud where AWS has been stagnating. On top of that all this tariff noise doesn't exactly help them either.

I wouldn't blame all of it on Jassy but we are approaching the time where Jassy should be heavily scrutinized and the decisions the next couple of years are going to be key. Caveat being AWS is way bigger than those names ""the stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient"".

1meesrl,2025-07-31,"Mark Zuckerberg says anyone not wearing AI glasses in the future will be at a disadvantage
https://fortune.com/2025/07/31/mark-zuckerberg-meta-ray-ban-smart-glasses-ai/

> Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in the company’s second-quarter earnings call that people who don’t wear smart glasses in the future may be at a “pretty significant cognitive disadvantage” compared to those who do. Zuckerberg’s comments come as Meta has established a “superintelligence” lab fueled with highly paid researchers to progress on AI. The company’s second-quarter earnings reported Wednesday surpassed analyst expectations. 

> “I think in the future, if you don’t have glasses that have AI or some way to interact with AI, I think you’re kind of similarly, probably [going to] be at a pretty significant cognitive disadvantage compared to other people and who you’re working with, or competing against,” he said during the call.  

> Just like regular eye glasses that help correct bad vision, smart glasses will be the main way people access and use AI, as well as “superintelligence,” to which Zuckerberg’s company has dedicated a highly paid team of researchers led by AI wunderkind Alexandr Wang.

1meelvr,2025-07-31,"META will have to stop buybacks or offer debt to fund AI investment


https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000162828025036719/meta-06302025xexhibit991.htm

Page 7 ""Condensed consolidated statement of cash flows"".

In 2025 META has spent $46B on investment activities on the back of $50B in net cash provided by operating activities.  In q2 investment activities was $300M more than cash provided by operating activities ($25.6b v $25.9B)

They have also spent $35B on financing activities in 2025, $22B from buying back stock.  In q2 $16B was used for financing activities $10B from buybacks.

This has drained their cash and equivalent position by just over $30B in 2025.  To continue to fund their AI investments which are supposed to be another $30B for q3/4 and then $60B in 2026 they will have to stop the buybacks or take on debt.
Just fire more employees They just made $18.6B (net income) in a single quarter. That quarter included $10B in buybacks.

And their holiday quarter is usually something like 20-25% higher than their next highest quarter?

So that’s $18B last Q, probably $15-$18 next Q, and then like $22B+ the Q after that. They’re set to haul in another $40B in net income in the next 6 months or something, assuming the economy doesn’t implode.

Their current buyback authorization (how much they CAN buyback, as approved by the board), is $80B. 

So, at $10B buyback per quarter, they could continue to rack in like $70-$80B per year in net income, and exhaust the current $80B authorization in 2 years.

So, if that all stays consistent, then they’ll buyback $80B (about 5-6% of shares at current pricing), AND make like $160B in net income, in 2 years.

Don’t really see issues here, unless I’m missing something? Literally only keep the top 5 employees, they should be able to handle everything they have 50B cash on hand and they have a massively profitable business. what exactly is the concern here? youre aware that during the next 6 months, their business, a cash printer, is still running?

you are correct that D&A is an expense, but it is a non cash expense, meaning it does not affect their operating cash flow. So long as their FCF exceeds their capex + capex (which it does by a very large margin), META is completely fine.

  
you're wording this post as if it's 2008 and META is about to go bankrupt Vibe ceo-ing META is not a construction company. They don't truly need to do this but it's their passion project. Look at reality labs, if they eliminated that segment alone that would free up almost 20B in a year but they choose to do so because their core business is just so profitable. Buybacks and dividends are flexible and can be suspended at any time. Will the stock price dip? Maybe because they typically trade at a 20 PE and they're currently hovering near 30.

Aaaaand ... it's down 2% As long as their revenue keeps growing, they are on track to hit a trillion in revenue by the 2030s. If they can do this, keep the cloud lead, and continue investing in robotics, they will be a big winner in the next decade Make that 4%. Advertising up 22% 

AWS up 17% 

Third party service up 10%

Subscription up 11%

Online retail up 10% 

The important, higher margin business, top 4, are growing double digit. 

Not sure what you mean by ""nothing to show for it"" First UNH now this… boss i can’t take it anymore 😰 AWS was disappointing by comparison to GCP or especially Azure, but the valuation is so much cheaper than Wall Street implies. 35x earnings doesn't seem cheap at first glance, but that ignores the inevitable margin expansion.

For Microsoft to double margins, they would have to achieve ~90% operating margins. For Alphabet, it would be around 65-70%. These are obviously pretty unrealistic numbers, so the forward expectations come primarily from sheer revenue growth (GOOG still has room for higher profitability, but not explosively higher). For Amazon, getting to 20% margins would represent a double. That is not only realistic, but pretty much inevitable.

The fastest growing business segments are all EXTREMELY high margin from a unit economics basis, namely AWS, ads, and subscriptions. They could just continue on the current trajectory and comfortably hit 20% in a decade without really changing much. But this completely ignores the possibility for huge efficiency gains in logistics with robotics, self driving and delivery tech, and better inventory management. This also completely ignores the flexibility of their spending. They could just up and decide one day to basically never grow OPEX again, and the business would largely sustain itself at the cost of some revenue growth. 

Do your future self a favor and look past the optically high PE multiple and the unexciting AWS growth figure this quarter and ask some common sense questions about the numbers as they are reported. 10% margins are nowhere close to maturity, this company is only starting to pull the profitability levers. Make that 6%

Jassy has ruined that company. AWS is shit nowadays, GCP and Azure far better and gaining market share. And the retail end is so capital intensive that FCF longterm is not as great as it seems.

1me8fia,2025-07-31,"Will Alphabet ever escape the looming spectre of open ai and the feds?
Posted some pretty great numbers. Similar to Microsoft which is up 5% as a result. Alphabet was up a couple of days but now down a few days later.

Open ai announced 700m users daily and Google dropped 2% on the news. If the court remedy comes out to break up parts of Google it's gonna drop line 10% I reckon.

I'm not sure what would cause this stock to ever rise again honestly. 
It isn’t openAI at this point that is the bug concern it’s the sheer amount of anti trust allegations google is facing that is holding it back. I mean the epic case was decided today then in august the punishment from the first anti trust case then there is the pending 2nd anti trust case that hasn’t reached a fjnal decision. That’s a lot of pressure and i don’t think it’s the end yet either. 

Would not be surprised if they get yet another anti trust case for ai mode/overviews. Sometimes being the best has its downsides and google is definitely squarely in this position literally the perfect company with anti trust cases and accusations up the wazoo. He executes but is boring as shit and not a hype man. Todays markets reward the hype men The government and this administration would be so dumb to tear apart our country’s best shot at AI.

Nothing matters except your most recent money order to him, and theirs may be too long ago. When the CEO gets fired.  It's pretty obvious that GOOG has the weakest leadership in the MAG7.  So what do regulators do?  They pile on the weak one that's known to not fight back.  They tried it with Zuck and realized they weren't getting anywhere, so they shifted focus on GOOG.

You need to realize, Gov antitrust is basically for show.  They just need to public to see they're doing something, so of course they're going to pick the easiest target > fallen way behind

1me866i,2025-07-31,"GOOG - when will it take off?
I’ve been slowly and steadily investing in GOOG - by looking at the books, it looks like a strong performer. Over the last few years, I’ve invested around $20K in it. The returns are not as staggering as other Mag 7 - it’s one of the worst performer of my portfolio. Still at 50% absolute gains, but dwarfed by how other Mag 7 grew in that period. Eg: Meta, MSFT, Amazon and of course our beloved NVDA. 

So, want to know from this group  - when do you think this stock will take off? And any particular reason (apart from anti-trust) why it has not already happened? 
When you sell. When the judge figures out what they are doing with the company. can you sell? i want my shares to rocket Amazon? Amazon is the outlier here lol, they've underperformed VOO.

Also what's your time frame? Microsoft underperformed VOO last year. Now they're one of the best performers this year. Chill out people, have some patience. Google can go up 50% and still be undervalued compared to Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, etc. It’s a mystery. All they do is ignore the noise and beat earnings almost every single time and print cash and lead in AI, AV, etc. I would keep buying, the ruling will be bullish for Google no matter what. The beatings will continue until morale improves Netflix is up 420 percent crushing all 3 of them...

I get your point, I own Google too and they haven't been as stellar as other positions. But I still believe in them.

The market still thinks OpenAI and others will eat search. I don't agree but we'll see. The market destroyed Netflix 3 years ago and now that they've basically won the streaming wars, the market gave them their premium back. We'll see if the same happens to Google. Google Deepmind is the most likely of any lab to crack AGI in my opinion. Even if you don’t believe AGI is imminent they have also been the most impressive developer of narrow AI for previously intractable problems (eg AlphaFold which won a Nobel prize for solving protein folding). They currently have one of the best LLMs and the best video gen model. They are also possibly the only mag7 company with a full stack in house (they can make their own processors - TPUs)

I expect a major breakout in the stock price when they develop the first truly essential AI application. It could be in any number of fields, it could be an AI product (chatbot, real time video, etc) or it could be the fruits of an AI scientific breakthrough, eg a spinout company doing nuclear fusion or next gen solar energy. Google is a slow grower. Make it a cornerstone of your portfolio don’t trade it. Time period is roughly 3 years - in that

1me69dm,2025-07-31,"$FIG is indicating $95-100, per CNBC
That values it at \~$59B,  at $100/share, and implies close to $40B overvaluation. The article below has stale numbers but wanted to include for context.

>The indications, which are signals from market makers of the level where trading may begin, imply as much as a 112% gain above the IPO price of $33 apiece. The shares were marketed for $30 to $32 per share, after the company increased the range earlier in the week.

>The company sold 12.47 million shares in the IPO, which priced Tuesday, while investors including Index Ventures, Greylock Partners and Kleiner Perkins sold 24.46 million shares.

>The IPO pricing gives Figma a market value of $16.1 billion, based on the outstanding shares listed in its filings. Accounting for employee stock options and restricted stock units, the company has a fully diluted value of roughly $18.5 billion.

>Including restricted stock units for Chief Executive Officer Dylan Field, which are subject to vesting conditions, the fully diluted value would rise above $19 billion.

>The figure is approaching the $20 billion valuation Figma would have fetched in a planned sale to Adobe Inc. that fell apart in 2023.

>The shares offered in Figma’s IPO were approaching 40 times oversubscribed, Bloomberg News reported Tuesday, in a sign of robust demand for the first sizable software offering in the US since SailPoint Inc.’s debut in February.

>Figma is used to design web and mobile application interfaces. It has expanded its suite of products in an attempt to be more useful for software development and general workplace collaboration.

>Like many software firms, Figma charges clients based on the number of users and the kind of seat those users have. It added Dev Mode to the platform in 2023 to enable closer collaboration with developers, and has more recently incorporated AI technology into many of its own tools. This year it introduced Figma Make, an AI-based product that lets the user turn prompts into functional prototypes.

>Now that the company is public, “we have to continue to sprint, to push hard, and we can’t let the public markets distract us,” Field said in an interview.

>Going public allows Figma to have a big brand moment which centers the importance of design, Field said. “This is a time where we can create tremendous value for our community, our customers, and I think the public market is the right place to do it.”

>The company is growing quickly, with a 46% year on year increase in first-quarter revenue.

>A key question for Figma’s long-term success is whether it can become a tool used pervasively used by office workers beyond designers. The company’s suite of tools is seeing strong adoption by software developers, product managers, and marketers, said Andrew Reed, a partner at Sequoia Capital and a member of Figma’s board.

>Sequoia, one of the most storied Silicon Valley venture firms, first invested in Figma in 2019. Around this time, companies were beginning to adopt Figma’s product en masse, Reed said.

>The use of AI-focused software creation apps which are potential competitors to Figma, such as Lovable and Bolt, has rapidly increased this year. Weaving AI features through Figma is a top priority, Field said. “We have so much room to explore how we can make great AI products and experiences.”

>**IPO Volume Climbs**

>The IPO has lifted the volume of first-time share sales on US exchanges above last year’s pace. There has been more than $21 billion worth of US first-time share sales in the year to date, excluding financial vehicles such as blank-check companies, just behind the $20.2 billion raised in the same period in 2024, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

>Demand for Figma’s IPO was likely helped by an order-taking process similar to an auction. Prospective investors in Figma’s offering were asked to precisely state the number of shares they wish to buy and at what price, a person familiar with the matter has said.

>Field will continue to control the company with 74.1% of the votes after the IPO through his holdings of Class B shares that have 15 votes each, the filings show.

>The CEO and fellow Brown University student Evan Wallace started Figma in 2012. Field attended Brown for two and a half years before accepting a Thiel Fellowship, the Peter Thiel-backed program that provides funding to young entrepreneurs, provided they drop out of school. Figma was widely embraced by designers who warmed to its browser-based interface, replacing previous methods of collaboration involving sharing files individually.

>Figma had net income of $44.9 million and revenue of $228 million in the three-month period ended March 31, according to its filings. It reported revenue growth in 2024, though rising operating expenses contributed to a net loss of $732 million for the year.

>Adobe, a maker of software for creative professionals, walked away from the deal to buy Figma following clashes with regulators. It paid a $1 billion termination fee.

>The offering was led by Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Allen & Co. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The company’s stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol FIG.

1me5q6m,2025-07-31,"Absolutely everything you need to know about AMZN earnings today
Okay guys, so Amazon is set to release its Q2 earnings after the market closes today with an analyst call at 5 pm. This is gonna be a big one. Did anyone catch META yesterday? Fuck. 

For Amazon, analysts expect revenue around $162 billion (up 10%) and EPS between $1.32 and $1.33, with operating income projected at $16.7 to $16.87 billion. And during this sesh, the key areas to watch will include AWS growth (estimated at $30.77 billion, up 17%), AI investments (over $100 billion capex planned), and advertising revenue (up 17% to $14.99 billion). Considering the stock performance, it's up 5% year-to-date, with bullish analyst sentiments (e.g., UBS raised price target to $271), but some valuation concerns exist (GF Value at $189.47). External factors like tariffs and Prime Day success could influence outcomes, with potential for significant stock movement based on guidance. I know that people are going to be playing AMZN earnings so I wanted to do a little write up for /r/Stocks so you guys are well informed. And I'll even post what I plan on getting at the end. 

**Analyst Expectations and Financial Projections**

Analysts have provided a range of estimates for Amazon's Q2 performance, showing a lot of optimism. 

Revenue: Expected to be around $162 billion, with variations such as $162.1 billion and $162.19 billion, representing a 9.5% to 10% year-over-year increase.  

Earnings Per Share (EPS): Forecasted at $1.32 to $1.33, up from $1.26 last year, with Amazon having beaten EPS estimates for nine consecutive quarters.  

Operating Income: Projected between $16.7 billion and $16.87 billion, a 13.8% to 15% increase, with an operating margin expected at 10.6% (up from 9.9% last year).  

These projections suggest strong growth, and I honestly think Amazon can exceed these figures and provide robust forward guidance. Especially given its historical ""beat and raise"" pattern, which may not suffice in the current up cycle.

**Key Business Segments and Growth Drivers**

Amazon's diverse operations are expected to drive its Q2 results, with several segments highlighted as critical:  

1) AWS (Amazon Web Services)  

AWS remains a cornerstone of Amazon's profitability, with Q1 2025 revenue up 17% to $29.3 billion. For Q2, net sales are estimated at $30.77 billion, with growth of 17% excluding foreign exchange effects. However, operating margins are expected to drop to 35% due to significant investments in AI and infrastructure, part of a $100+ billion capex plan for 2025. This segment contributed 17% of revenue and 58% of operating income last year, making it a focal point for me.

2) Advertising Revenue  

Advertising is another growth engine, with Q1 2025 revenue up 18%. For Q2, it's projected to rise 17% to $14.99 billion, reflecting increased monetization of Amazon's platform as more businesses leverage its advertising ecosystem.

3) Prime Membership  

Prime membership grew 9% year-over-year to 220 million globally, providing a stable revenue stream through subscription fees. This growth, driven by benefits like free shipping and streaming, is expected to continue supporting Amazon's financials.

4) Operational Efficiency  

Amazon has improved operational efficiency, reducing fulfillment costs and increasing delivery speeds, which should enhance margins. These efforts are part of a broader strategy to balance growth investments with profitability.

5) Investments in AI and Other Areas  

Amazon's commitment to AI is a major theme, with a $100+ billion capital expenditure plan for 2025, primarily focused on AWS and AI services. This includes developing proprietary chips like Trainium2 and partnering with Nvidia to enhance AI capabilities. While these investments may pressure short-term margins, they position Amazon for long-term growth in the expanding AI market. Additionally, Project Kuiper, a satellite initiative, is noted as an area of rising expense, alongside e-commerce and content/advertising investments.

**Analyst sentiments are generally bullish**

UBS raised its price target from $249 to $271, calling Amazon the ""most coiled"" Big Tech name, implying an 18% upside and highlighting extensive investments across e-commerce, AWS, content/advertising, and Kuiper. Other analysts, including Wedbush, William Blair, and Stifel, reiterated ""outperform"" or ""buy"" ratings, with an average price target of $252.66 (range: $195 to $305). 

**External Factors and Market Context**

Several external factors could influence Amazon's earnings and stock reaction:  

Consider the Tariffs. Earlier this year, tariff concerns, particularly on Chinese goods, weighed on the stock, but recovery followed eased U.S. tariffs. Analysts are parsing impacts on e-commerce, with Amazon benefiting from stockpiling ahead of potential tariff hikes.

Also, think about the Prime Day Success. Held in July, Prime Day's performance could lift revenue guidance for the September-ending quarter, providing a positive signal for us.  

And finally, with any earnings post, we need to consider macroeconomic events such as inflation, interest rates, and consumer spending trends could affect retail sales, particularly in online stores and third-party seller revenue, expected to grow 6.5% to $58.99 billion and 7% to $38.74 billion, respectively.

**Potential Catalysts**

I'm expecting accelerating AWS growth, better-than-expected margins, new AI announcements, and strong Q3 guidance. UBS expects upward revisions to operating profit and free-cash-flow as revenue grows, potentially more dramatic than peers.  


**Comparisons**

Microsoft's recent Q2 results, where cloud growth was a significant driver, boosts my confidence in Amazon's cloud business, with MSFT stock jumping 4.47% in after-hours trading. This really does show how important AWS performance will be, as Amazon faces a high bar following Microsoft's strong showing.

**So what to do?**

Amazon's Q2 earnings are poised to be a major event, with strong growth expected across key segments like AWS, advertising, and Prime, supported by significant AI investments. This will be a great opportunity to get a call spread. For those who don't know anything about option trading, you don't need to continue reading. But for those who do, I'll be buying the 8/1 245c (@ 2.67) and selling the 252.5c (@ 1.11). This means I can get the spread for $156, with a potential max gain of 4.8x if AMZN can go up about 7.8% with earnings. Considering the stock moves on average about ±8% with earnings, there's a good chance it'll go up 4-8% today. 

Next week tho, we have a ton more earnings so I think I'll be doing a post on PLTR and AMD.
RIP op I lost 4k in 1 minute rip It doesn’t make sense anymore. They beat estimated EPS  of $1.33 billion and reported $1.68 billion. 
Sales estimates were $1.62 billion and they reported $1.67 billion in sales. 

Only to be down $16 in after hours trading. You can’t make this up anymore.  AWS growth needs to reaccelerate. I believe it decelerated last quarter and that’s why they got put in the penalty box like Google last quarter. 

Yea it went from 19 percent to 17 percent. Can’t read, happy for you tho AWS accounts for over half of its operating income. So full port amazon? thanks. I'm expecting a similar sympathy rally across AMD/NVIDIA just like MSFT/META did. However entire market seems down atm. as far as i know, investors really didnt like that their free cash flow decreased more than 60%. they did some heavy reinvesting and got punished for it, definitely gonna play amazon again in the next earnings date though, i think it might just pay off in the future FCF down big and AWS share down.

1me3nil,2025-07-31,"Is MSFT still a buy?
Microsoft has been a giant for decades. They continually print money while being that giant in the background while everyone else clamors for other tech names. They have pumped on cloud revenue and the expanding of their AI.   
  
I am in my first year of investing, and I'm wondering if MSFT after pumping post-earnings is still a valuable buy, or if I should wait for it to cool off. How much do they have room to grow, and is there a better play for pure cloud exposure? It would seem to me, their investment in OpenAI and Azure will be big for the AI industry moving forward, but there is the risk that AI doesn't find the profitability compared to spending people think it will. They clearly have the money to buy smaller players, and are still an industry leader for a reason.

Right now, I have positions in SNOW and GOOGL for cloud. Do you guys have any pure cloud plays that you are hot on right now?
Always If MSFT collapses, something even crazier is happening in the world hah the only single stock I would legitimately argue over certain sector based ETFs Probably the safest investment out there. Traders on March 10, 2000 would like to hi-five you. MSFT and GOOG are basically ETFs themselves.

1me1eux,2025-07-31,"Trump lashed out at Powell again, but this time he might not be wrong? $SPY $QQQ $TLT
Trump recently took to Truth Social to once again criticize Jerome Powell, calling him “too late,” “too aggressive,” “too stupid,” and “too political,” and accusing him of costing the U.S. “trillions.” He even criticized the renovation of the Federal Reserve headquarters as “the most corrupt construction project in history.”

It sounds like Trump is losing his mind, but the key point is that he might actually be right this time.

Current Market Context July 31, 2025  

Federal Funds Rate: Still at 5.25%, with Powell maintaining a hawkish stance this month.  

June CPI YoY: 3.6%, lower than last month's 3.9% but still above the 2% target.  

Core PCE Data (just released): Held steady at 3.3%.

Labor Market: Last week’s nonfarm payrolls data slowed, with the unemployment rate rising to 4.2%.  

10-Year Treasury Yield: Back up to 4.5%, with $TLT getting hammered again.  

S&P/Nasdaq: Rebounded slightly after earnings season, but volatility is rising again as the market begins to digest the reality of “long-term high interest rates.”  

Is Powell really “too late” again?

To be honest, Powell has always been chasing the market, never leading it:  

2021: “Inflation is temporary” backfired.  

2022-2023: Initiated the fastest pace of rate hikes in 40 years.

2024: He paused rate hikes early, only for inflation to return.

2025: Now we're in a mild “stagflation” state, stuck between a rock and a hard place.

Trump may be harsh with his words, but the nickname “Too Late” isn't entirely undeserved. Powell always reacts after the fact, and the market has grown tired of his pace.

As for what he meant by “renovation corruption”?

Many speculate he's referring to the Federal Reserve headquarters (Marriner Eccles Building) renovation project, which has a budget exceeding $2 billion and has been significantly delayed, becoming a political joke for months.

So what should be done now?

The market is currently in a state of wait-and-see: bulls want to see rate cuts; bears believe inflation hasn't been resolved; Trump has already shifted the blame onto Powell. If Powell cuts rates too early, inflation could spike again; if he waits too long, the economy could hard-land.

Trump's statements may be bold, but they're not entirely irrational.  

Powell has indeed been slow to act, and now everyone is paying the price for his “lagging response.”  

With high interest rates and sticky inflation, $SPY and $QQQ are also waiting for a clear direction.  

Powell, it's time to stop being too late.
1) inflation is higher than it was in April
2) SPY/QQQ is at all time highs
3) being reactionary on interest rates is better than cutting too early and risking higher inflation

you need to do some more research “To be honest, Powell has always been chasing the market, never leading it.”

That’s what the Fed chair is supposed to do. 

Just like how Ben Bernanke reacted accordingly to the 2008 financial crisis. 

You think cutting rates is going to be good for the economy and prices? Forget the reported numbers and just go and look at your grocery bill. Now tell me if it’s a good idea to stimulate the economy with cheap money.

Sure, I’m an investor in stocks and have always been a net buyer, lower interest rates would be great for my investments. But I care about people’s cost of living and the long term future of the country way more than the value of my portfolio. “5.25%” either you used a shit AI to write this or you don’t know what you’re talking about at all He hasn’t been slow to act. Because that’s the job to react to data. You’ll always be slightly behind. Rates are not at 5.25 anymore haven't been for 8 months.... I think you're looking high inflation as 'horribly handled'.  You should also consider avoiding a massive, worldwide recession/depression as an possible result of the pandemic and re-opening of the economy.  

That we avoided that is a huge win that Powell isn't ever going to get credit for Lmao the original OP out here believing MAGA math. 

the bottom 90% consumers all had the largest tax increase in our lifetimes

And the deficit is accelerating at the fastest rate ever 

Inflation is back and no signs of slowing as the new taxes keep getting announced (tarriff rates changes every other week makes planning harder for the adults) Fed can lower rate but bond yield will never go back down because the trust between USA and investors is already compromised. Plus, cheetos man thinks lower interest will cut our national debt payment - NOT, interest rates on those bonds have all ready been set. And guess what. Every single central bank made the same errors. The only reason Powell hasn’t cut this time is waiting to see impact of tariffs.

1me0p6y,2025-07-31,"Microsoft Nears $4 Trillion Market Cap After Another Strong Quarter  Reddit Earnings Tonight Could Surprise
Microsoft just dropped its Q4 earnings and, honestly, it’s pretty impressive. The company beat on both revenue and earnings again, with Azure cloud revenue hitting $75 billion for the year  up 34%. CEO Satya Nadella said AI and cloud are driving business transformation everywhere, and judging by the numbers, it’s hard to argue. The stock popped about 9% in pre-market trading, putting Microsoft within striking distance of a $4 trillion market cap. That’s insane.

Some analysts say FY26 will be the real AI breakout year for Microsoft  meaning this quarter is just the warm-up act. And with tools like Copilot gaining traction, it feels like the company still has plenty of runway. But here’s the thing: with shares jumping so fast, is now the time to buy more, or are we getting ahead of ourselves?

Meanwhile, Reddit is set to report Q2 earnings after the bell today. The stock has been volatile since its IPO  beating expectations on revenue and earnings but getting hit because daily active user (DAU) growth has slowed, partly due to changes in Google’s search algorithm that impacted traffic. Google still sends Reddit roughly 40-50% of its traffic, so that’s a big risk.

That said, some signs suggest Reddit’s user growth might be stabilizing, and their recent launch of AI-powered ad tools could be a game-changer. If they can show some real DAU growth or ad revenue momentum tonight, the stock might pop again. But how much of Reddit’s future is tied to Google’s whims? Is Reddit’s community strong enough to survive if that traffic tap slows?

Looking at the bigger picture, this AI and cloud run feels a bit like the early days of cloud computing back in 2020  huge opportunity, but also a risk of buying into froth. Are you leaning into giants like Microsoft and Nvidia that have proven track records, or are you more interested in higher-risk, higher-reward names like Reddit? And with Amazon and Apple earnings coming soon, August is shaping up to be an interesting month.
Reddit is up 8% pre market. ive definitely been telling people to buy Reddit for like a month The hype around earning beats is all fun and games, but much of it still reflects top-line results on paper. Over 50% of Microsofts revenue comes from international markets, which is beneficial for the revenue in the short-term.

That said, I am not so sure the same applies to Reddit. Bought in yesterday, so that's some good news! Hopefully earnings are banger. 20x sales, I’m sure there are many people bought it Outside of ETF's, Nvidia is my largest holding with Reddit coming in second. Average cost of 110 on Reddit. Waiting for the financial report information Just sold ALL of my AVGO.  I believe I need more MSFT. Mind as well buy some BBAI.. Management is one of the most incompetent out there for a big company.

Just take a moment and fully process that the above is a quote from the President of the United States, speaking this way.  

No matter your view on Powell and rates, the above is so far beyond what is acceptable language for the leader of the free world to be using.

1mdwtm4,2025-07-31,"Healthcare and tech stock, what's going on?
I rotated into healthcare ""undervalued, defensive, steady cash flow"" and I'm down 20–25% on names like CNC, MOH, and yeah, GEHC too. Watching GE HealthCare drop 6.5% the other day even after raising guidance? Brutal. Margins are getting squeezed by tariffs, and the market doesn't care about the long-term outlook, just immediate profits. Same story in every segment.

Also, like some other people, tech, AI, I've been DCAing into AAPL, AVGO, WRD and even a bit of MSFT again. Those moves felt smart a few months ago.  

I know people are bailing on healthcare and piling into tech now... same thing happened in reverse during April lows. The cycle is just... exhausting. But I'm still holding. Because health insurance isn't going anywhere. Premiums are going to rise next year and there's real talk about softening the policy damage. And tech? it HAS TO GROW, we're living in a time of forward momentum, not stagnation or decline.

I totally get everything, yeah. But selling now after averaging in?
I love these posts where OP is gradually trying to convince themselves they know exactly what they're doing but clearly have no idea You are losing money.

Why don’t you just buy the SP500 instead of gambling I had the same thought and went to diversify my tech heavy portfolio into healthcare….. they have not performed and I bought UNH which keeps dropping ….i will probably keep UNH long term - surely it is likely to recover?! I work in pharma and I can tell you the whole industry is being decimated. Tons of drugs going off-patent, loads of layoffs, R&D is being decreased, and FDA is not responding. Pharma and Biotech are most certainly in a recession and the stock prices reflect that. Even LLY, the poster child for success, is 25% off the highs for a year, NVO is down 60% with their weight loss drugs. It's a really terrible time. 

This is not exactly the same as healthcare industrial stocks, but im certain it trickles down and is in a similar position. “I keep putting money into this slot machine and I don’t get any back, what’s going on?” Well, we’ve all been there So you’re rotating from winning companies with strong growth over the last few years into losers with declining or negative growth over the last few years. Not exactly sure why people think that’s smart. Then you go and rotate back into tech but pick the worst tech with slowest growth in their respective industries, again not that smart. At least the tech ones probably won’t lose money in the long term but they’re not the best picks atm. 



If you wanted to rotate into healthcare there are better options that have had growing revenue and cash flows the last few years. The administration is against Medicare and have been talking of cuts the whole time then yall surprised there’s cuts and shocked the companies heavily relying on Medicare income go down. 



You think insurance companies can just raise premiums forever? You don’t see any consumers unhappy with that and seeking alternatives? You don’t see any companies stepping in to be that alternative for consumers? HIMS? One medical? GoodRx? Cheaper urgent care centers? Like seriously people aren’t seeing the shift in healthcare? So many people think CVS is a big turn around and ignoring all the newer modern competition, same with UNH and CNC. 



I’m bullish on healthcare as a segment, we have a very old population and very unhealthy population, but people picks are fucking terrible. Picking the biggest losers just bc they’re dinosaurs and “huge turnaround” is dumb, they’re losing and down for a reason. If it was that or staying in “expensive” tech then stay in the tech that’s at least growing 20%+ a year. 



To answer your question more directly: what’s going on is that many people are chasing short term gains and just not looking at middle/long term trends. They’re making bad choices and trusting management that has proven they can’t make the shift society is so obviously pushing for. Why would you ever chase trends? It almost requires an element of greater fool theory. Have you been able to beat the market? You’re buying at the top of a fragile economic situation You are thinking like any of this makes sense anymore. The market moves depending on how everyone combined ""feels"" about it.

1mdva9x,2025-07-31,"BAT profit beats estimates as US, its biggest market, returns to growth
July 31 (Reuters) - British American Tobacco exceeded first-half profit estimates on Thursday as its U.S. business grew for the first time in three years, a potential turnaround in its largest market as new tariffs are introduced and consumer preferences shift.


BATS (BATS.L) said it expects annual revenue growth to come in at the top end of its forecast range.


The maker of Lucky Strike and Dunhill cigarettes said revenue in the U.S., which makes up about 44% of total sales, grew 3.7% at constant currency, with Velo, its nicotine pouches, helping sales of its new category products grow 3.9%.


Its smokeless products, which include Velo, Vuse Ultra premium vapour, and glo Hilo heated tobacco, make up more than 18% of total revenue.
BAT and peers such as Philip Morris (PM.N), Imperial Brands (IMB.L), and Altria (MO.N) are trying to capture a bigger share of the vapes, tobacco heating product and oral nicotine pouches market as sales drop in traditional tobacco products.


While most of BAT's products sold in the U.S. are produced locally, its Vuse vape devices are made in Indonesia, now subject to a 19% tariff.


CEO Tadeu Marroco said at a news briefing that BAT had front-loaded some stock to mitigate this in the short-term, but would look to absorb most of the tariff via its profit margin, adding that U.S.-produced liquids were a bigger part of its business.


BAT would also be exposed to higher costs via items such as packaging material, he said, though the impact of this was ""manageable"" and the company was watching how consumers would be affected by widespread tariff changes for the rest of the year.


It reported adjusted diluted earnings of 162 pence per share for the six months to June 30, compared with 159.4 pence a year ago, and a company-compiled consensus estimate of 154.8 pence.


The company said it was on track to achieve its 2025 financial forecast, with annual sales growth likely at the upper end of its 1%-2% forecast range.

Tech/AI earnings have been mostly solid across the board this earnings season. META was a good indicator that social advertising should be robust, which is promising for RDDT’s own earnings.

I full ported RDDT for last earnings and got burned. But tempted to try again this time. Maybe even RDTL. Thoughts? 
Don't full port anything - this is some WSB level of self destruction Dude if you full ported this before Q1 '25 earnings you would have bought at the top and lost over 50% of your money Rddt seems like it has lots of upside to me.

RDDT makes up about 10% of my brokerage. I bought at $200+ and felt the drop the last year. Bought more shares around $100. With a PE of 30 and a market cap of $27billion they’re significantly undervalued. I’ve talked to lots of people who have never used it and are interested in the user interface and feel of the early internet. Sold my Amazon to buy Reddit this morning. Maybe a mistake, but it's my smallest position either way so I don't care that much. Definitely not options trading it - and I'd suggest you not do anything full-portfolio lol. Thankfully I added little by little throughout 2024. So my cost basis was low enough that I didn’t suffer too much last time. Should have been your biggest position 😀 I was literally reading up on ""how to buy call options"" and had selected options for Reddit for August 1st, $165 with all my margin.

1mdpr4o,2025-07-31,"Microsoft tops $4 trillion in market cap after hours, joining Nvidia in exclusive club
The $4 trillion club has a second member, at least based on after-hours trading.

Following a better-than-expected earnings report on Wednesday, Microsoft shares jumped 8%, lifting the software giant’s market cap to about $4.1 trillion. Should the rally stick on Thursday, Microsoft would join chipmaker Nvidia, which hit $4 trillion for the first time earlier this month.

Microsoft reported 18% revenue growth, its fastest rate of expansion in over three years, driven by its Azure cloud computing business. Microsoft disclosed Azure revenue in dollars for the first time, and said sales from Azure and other cloud services exceeded $75 billion in fiscal 2025, up 34% from the prior year.

As of the close on Wednesday, Microsoft shares were up 22% for the year, topping the S&P 500′s 8% gain. Microsoft hit a record close of $513.71 on July 25. The stock is above $553 in extended trading.

Nvidia and Microsoft, two of the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence boom, have zoomed past Apple on the market cap leaderboard. Apple is third at about $3.2 trillion, with its stock having fallen 17% this year as investors worry that the iPhone maker is getting left behind in AI. Apple reports quarterly results after the bell on Thursday.

Among tech’s megacaps, Nvidia has been the best performer in 2025, up 33%. The chipmaker’s graphics processing units (GPUs) are the backbone of the large language models being developed by Microsoft, OpenAI, Google, Meta and others, and they’re filling up data centers being built by those same companies.

Nvidia is scheduled to report results in late August.

According to [InvestingPro](https://ca.investing.com/pro/QCOM) data, the company maintains a strong financial health score of 3.01 (rated as ""GREAT""), with a P/E ratio of 16.12x that appears attractive relative to its near-term earnings growth potential.

1mdov6r,2025-07-31,"Trump slaps universal 50% tariff on copper imports
President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed on order imposing a universal 50% tariff on copper
 imports, the latest metal he has targeted with a steep import tax.      

U.S. copper prices plunged as much as 18% in after-hours trading as soon as the White House announced the new tariff rate.      
why would copper prices in the US fall in response to a tariff that constrains supply? Man, I stopped trying to apply logic to this stock market a long time ago. For those wondering, it’s not on all copper. I was wondering why it crashed. Per NYT it applies to copper pipes, wires, rods, sheets and tubes and some other products like pipe filters and cables.

So for your stock info keep that in mind. This seems to be done under the same authority as the steel ones so I doubt this gets pulled back  US copper prices we are talking about cathodes and concentrates. These products are essentially raw materials for copper wires etc and are exempted.

The reason why the price fell is because (1) the US copper price (COMEX) was trading at a premium ~20-30% above LME prices in anticipation of the tariffs. Since there was no tariff on these raw materials, it tanked back to parity Stealing copper is back in vogue The opposite Sooo basically any infrastructure copper got it Nothing makes America more competitive in global manufacturing than massively increasing the cost of input materials. What's left, copper kitchen ware, and copper casting grains?
BB's maybe? Likely users of cast copper/brass/bronze products. So the electrical transmission industry and power providers, since switchgear uses cast components and linesman use cast hooks for grounding clamps and tools.

No. Hedging a position costs money (or something else) it essentially limits both up and downside.

1mdlham,2025-07-30,"Which one of these would you choose and why? NVO,UNH,PYPL
I'm considering adding one of these stocks to my portfolio. Which one would you choose and why? I understand that the healthcare sector is facing challenges this year, but I believe this will be temporary. Next year could be more promising for healthcare stocks. I've also included PayPal on my list. 

1. PayPal 
2. UnitedHealth 
3. Novo Nordisk 

Thank you in advance!
NVO.

Huge company growing by double digits per year. They have been fine for 100+ years and will be another hundred. NVO, double digit growth still even with the gloomy outlook, $15b in annual profits, and now a 4% and growing dividend due to the sell off…..this is one of those buy and hold forever stocks. I’d go with Novo Nordisk (NVO)-strong position in diabetes and obesity treatment,solid earnings growth,increasing dividend and overall very stable.

UnitedHealth (UNH) is also solid and stable, but with slower growth.
PayPal (PYPL) is more of a risky bet-it might recover,but it's facing a lot of challenges right now. those look like 3 stocks i don't wanna touch right now,  even with your money lmao at it selling off 30% because it guided 8-14% earnings growth, like any other company and 8-14% growth would be a good thing UNH UNH. Their competition is still light years behind them and the percent of GDP going to healthcare in the US is still going up.  There is no way the DOJ would bar them from the Medicare advantage program as there are virtually no other providers.  PayPal and Novo are both facing increasing competition in the next few years and have not shown an ability to deal with it. I own all three and I am adding to UNH, sticking with NVO and selling PYPL. 
I’ personally went with UNH, it’s low and healthcare insurance will grow. More population growth more people need it. Susceptible to policy changes like currently experiencing but long term and if Democrats come in next term I feel like they’ll reinstate the Medicaid etc and these stock will fly even more I’m leaning towards UNH None… still better opportunities.

Microsoft stock climbed more than 6% on the news.

""Cloud and AI is the driving force of business transformation across every industry and sector,"" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement.

“We’re innovating across the tech stack to help customers adapt and grow in this new era, and this year, Azure surpassed $75 billion in revenue, up 34 percent, driven by growth across all workloads.”

For the quarter, Microsoft saw adjusted EPS of $3.65 on revenue of $76.4 billion. Wall Street was anticipating adj. EPS of $3.37 and revenue of $73.89 billion, according to Bloomberg analyst consensus estimates. The company saw adj. EPS of $2.95 and revenue of $64.72 billion in the same period last year.

Intelligent Cloud segment revenue, which includes Microsoft’s Azure business, topped out at $29.8 billion. Analasts were looking for $29.09 billion.

The company says it anticipated between $47.5 billion and $50.5 billion in third quarter revenue, well ahead of the $46.2 billion Wall Street was calling for.

Meta stock jumped more than 8% immediately following the announcement.

For Q2, Meta saw earnings per share (EPS) of $7.14 on revenue of $47.5 billion. Analysts were anticipating EPS of $5.89 on revenue of $44.83 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. The company saw EPS of $5.16 and revenue of $39.07 billion in the same period last year.

Imagine being a Meta employee who started in November 2022 when their RSUs would have been granted at around $90: https://i.imgur.com/bRAntik.gif Meta is building an all-star team that is like the Philadelphia Eagles of AI

Will they win the AI race? IDK. But they'll be in the playoffs every year Up 9% in AH

US Tech and anything AI adjacent is just absolutely dusting every other sector of the economy once again. I literally know someone who left for meta in November 2022, they can retire at this point. i dont think theres been anything in history as dominant as us tech is now. nvidia+msft are larger than the dutch east india company was, and theres another 20T of big tech under that.

  
after seeing the earnings today you kind of just have to take a step back and appreciate you are living through a once in a century moment. Same, I also know someone. I’m not kidding. I still remember him leaving for Meta and saying he was making his start date ASAP because “I want to get in now while the stock is low”. Yep, software engineer I have a cost basis of under 120$ for META. 

It was one of the easiest plays of the last 5 years. They were WAY oversold for what is a company that prints money. 

Every reddit criticism of them was completely unfounded. People still to this day state that ""no one uses METAs products anymore"" or ""only old people use METAs products"" and are completely bereft from reality. Meta is in a ridiculously good position right now.

Facebook and Instagram are money printers, to the tune of $45 billion *a quarter.* People raise concerns about Snapchat and TikTok and whatever else, but the company has perfected the art of acquiring and/or copying all their potential threats and ultimately staying ahead.

Their Metaverse effort was always a moonshot, and VR is probably an expensive mistake on their part, but they are getting good traction with AR glasses.

They have assembled the Avengers of AI, and in 6-12 months of development will have the tech to challenge OpenAI, Anthropic and Google. What they actually do with it remains to be seen.

Should both Metaverse and AI turn out to be complete duds, the company would have wasted a few tens of billions of dollars but their core social advertising model will remain intact, continuing to generate $50+ billion a quarter.

Should either one of them actually pan out, they will add *trillions* to their market cap. “Meta is dead.” I’ve gotten so much hate for talking about the seemingly endless runway they have ahead and the quality of the long term vision.

1md9dh8,2025-07-30,"Roku's second quarter earnings outlook: Wall Street is optimistic about its partnership with Amazon and the growth potential of its advertis
Consumer electronics company Roku (Nasdaq: ROKU) will report its second-quarter results after the market closes on Thursday, July 31. Investors will closely monitor signs of growth in ad inventory, potential growth from its partnership with Amazon, and subscription growth.

Analysts expect Roku to report a loss of $0.16 per share and revenue of $1.07 billion, representing a 10% increase from last year.

Wedbush analysts anticipate that Roku will benefit from its DSP partnerships, high-quality inventory, improved targeting, sports-related advertising, and the variety of price points available on its platform.

Analysts predict that Roku's platform revenue will grow by 14% year-over-year to $940 million, in line with expectations.

Analysts stated, “Nevertheless, given Roku's increasingly diversified business model, expanding advertising opportunities, and achievable parameters across its entire operational model, we believe its guidance still has upside potential.”

Wedbush expects Roku to maintain its 2025 EBITDA guidance and 2026 positive operating income target, similar to the first quarter.

Over the past three months, earnings per share forecasts have been lowered four times, revenue forecasts have been raised twice, and revenue forecasts have been lowered 21 times.

Bank of America analysts recently raised their target price for Roku (ROKU) and reiterated their bullish rating, citing improved macroeconomic sentiment and the favorable impact of its recently announced partnership with Amazon (AMZN).

They noted that the partnership with Amazon “once again demonstrates Roku's intention to become more flexible and further drive interoperability within its platform.”

1md6cp4,2025-07-30,"EURUSD falls to lowest since early July What does this mean for equities and macro?
With the recent macro situation, this could have a knock-on effect on equities and risk assets:

This morning, the EURUSD fell to its lowest since early July and is currently hovering around 1.0800. That's not a small drop, and a few days ago we were near the top of 1.09.

There are probably a few reasons at the heart of this decline: 

US economic data was too strong 

Q2 GDP was revised upwards to 2.8% (previously 2.3%).

Core PCE (the Fed's most watched inflation indicator) was higher than expected.

These data strengthened the market's expectations that the Fed will “keep interest rates high for longer” and made the dollar stronger.

ECB releases dovish signals 

Eurozone inflation data showed some easing.

Germany's latest PMI data is very weak, recession fears are rising again.

Some ECB officials are starting to sound cautious, and the market expects that rate cuts could start in early 2026 (and there are even suggestions that they could be possible by the end of 2025).

Safe-haven capital is pouring into the dollar 

Geopolitical situations are heating up (e.g. Ukraine, global trade tensions), allowing the dollar to attract a lot of capital as a safe-haven asset.

Meanwhile, U.S. bond yields remain firm 10-year U.S. bonds are close to 4.3%.

What does this mean for the markets?

Large tech stocks and those companies that are heavily influenced by the dollar (e.g., $AAPL, $MSFT, $META) could be under pressure, especially since a good portion of their revenue comes from Europe.

Multinationals (e.g., $PG, $KO, $JNJ) could take a loss in Q3 earnings due to exchange rate losses.

Eurozone stocks (which can be followed via the $EZU or $FEZ ETFs) could be pressured by economic weakness, but a weak euro favors German exporters, such as automakers.

Dollar-denominated commodities (e.g., gold, crude oil) could come under pressure in the short term due to a stronger dollar, unless macro risks push up safe-haven demand, such as gold.

My take?

Short-term weakness in the euro is justified, but the next thing to watch is whether US inflation continues to “stick”, and the Fed's attitude at its annual meeting in Jackson Hole at the end of August. If Powell is hawkish again, we could see EUR/USD fall to 1.07 or even 1.06.

Is anyone hedging their exchange rate risk with forex manipulation, long DXY (dollar index) options, or in company earnings reports? Would love to hear how people are laying it out.
What are you talking about? EUR USD is 1.15 are you drunk ? its nowhere near 1.08.

1.1468-0.0077(-0.6669%) Yeah ,1.147 Fed won’t hold the interest rate any longer. The correlation between Gold, USD, Securities, Macroeconomic are pretty complicated and the balance is not necessarily being acted as market is simply a bunch of people. Gold will decline further with less uncertainties while dollar will have a consolidation period if inflation is stable , GDP is growing and interest rates is declining. The balance between inflation and spending in US is somewhat stable in my opinion. 

In short, the factors that affect the price action on EURO will be similar. The revenue from the companies you listed are vital plus they are expanding harder and I expect the investment will only increase into India or emerging countries as it’s a known fact about tariffs.

>The California-based cybersecurity company will pay shareholders $45 apiece for 2.2005 shares of CyberArk, representing a 26% premium to its share price Friday. The deal is expected to close during Palo Alto Networks’ fiscal year 2026.  


>Shares of Palo Alto fell more than 7% before the bell Wednesday, building on a 5% loss from Tuesday. CyberArk’s stock dipped 2%.  


>“Our market entry strategy has always been to enter categories at their inflection point, and we believe that moment for Identity Security is now,” Palo Alto CEO and chairman Nikesh Arora said in a release Wednesday.  


>Blockbuster cybersecurity deals have been a force in the mergers and acquisitions market in 2025 after a relatively slow period for dealmaking. In March, Google shelled out [$32 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/18/google-to-acquire-cloud-security-startup-wiz-for-32-billion.html) for cloud security startup Wiz in its biggest acquisition ever.  


>Palo Alto Networks intends to use the deal to officially penetrate the identity security market and improve its multi-layer offering for customers, the company said.  


>He added that CyberArk offers a “foundational technology” necessary in the AI world.  


>The Wall Street Journal reported [Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/29/cyberark-shares-jump-on-report-of-palo-alto-networks-takeover-talks.html) that both companies had discussed a potential deal, sending shares of CyberArk skyrocketing more than 13%.  


>CyberArk, which went public a little over a decade ago, creates identity software tools that grant employees access to platforms and applications. As artificial intelligence advances, these tools have become more critical to protecting businesses against cyber and ransomware threats.
Biggest and second biggest Israeli exits of all time happening within a 4 month period. In the case of Palo Alto, acquiring another company means either dilution, shelling out a lot of cash, or taking on significant debt. Investors might see this as a bad deal.

In the case of CyberArk, there were already rumors of a potential deal that drove the price up, and shareholders may have been hoping for a higher price. Can someone eli5 why this caused such a sharp drop? Calls or no? LEAPS for me Wiz You mean $450 a piece Bought some shares of CYBR yesterday and it seems the deal will happen only on 2026, don't know if I made a bad choice or should I hold (looks like it had an initial drop today but it's slowly going back up) The news is not correct. Cyberark shareholders will receive 2.2 shares of PANW per share of CYBR. In addition to that CYBR shareholders get 45 USD per share. What is stated here makes absolutely no sense.

Isn’t he right then to hold the rates? How is he underestimating? Always reassuring to hear J Powell speak and be reminded there's at least one competent person left in government. For anyone who has heard or believes that Powell is a boogeyman, do yourself a favor and listen to this press conference.

As always, he explains very clearly and calmly what the Fed board is doing and precisely why.  

He’s nothing remotely close to the wild narratives.  

And today’s press conference isn’t unique.  This is literally who he is, every time.

He’s even polite and patient and informative when responding to dunderheaded smear questions from Fox News lackeys. The thing that bugs me the most is how Potus acts like he was elected CEO of every company, and all of their intellectual and physical property is somehow his to bargain with.

1mctc0m,2025-07-30,"How do market crashes happen?
Hi, so I've only just started putting a small amount of money into the market these past 2 years, and never actively followed it before. My question is that to anyone who remembers trading through the GFC and the dot com bubble bursting, what does it take for the market to reconsider how they valued stocks.

For example, does a crash start from one company crashing which reminds people to revalue their other holdings, or does everything crash at once from maybe a jobs report being worse than expected? 

Hypothetically, if a large stock like TSLA disillusioned a lot of it's investors and corrected by a significant margin, does that have potential to ripple across the entire market?

I couldn't find much information surrounding these questions elsewhere, so I was hoping some of you could help paint the picture for me.
When you least expect it, for reasons no one knows, with someone grandstanding 18 months later claiming they saw it coming and you should have listened. They happen a lot of different ways. Bubbles are probably the most common reason, such as in 2000/2001 and in 2008, but those also happened in different ways. 2001 was the market kinda working like it's supposed to--sorting out the winners and losers in a new glitzy sector. The housing bubble bursting in 2008 wouldn't have been such a massive problem if the world wasn't relying on a bunch of Americans paying their mortgages so that they could retire.

You have the Great Depression, which started with a market declining, saw a bunch of governments(the US primarily among them) tariffing one another, dragging down global growth, and then everything came crashing down.

You have Acts of God--COVID fits well here. You have wars, though they can often be good for business, unfortunately. Politics can do it: if the US goes mad and decides to default, the market would crash instantly. The Federal Reserve can deliberately crash the market by raising interest rates really high, like we saw in the 80s. There can also be deflation, though that seems to be something that has been mostly engineered out of economies with the exception of Japan ten years ago and China right now.

But Tesla going down isn't going to crash the market. Tesla is a company that I feel like we all secretly know is a shitty company that should be worth 30/share--if that.

\*EDIT\* I should point out, that a lot of these crashes take longer than we remember them taking. It's a 'slowly, then all at once' kind of thing. The Great Recession took over a year for the S/P to go from top to bottom. And that too.  Hindsight is always 20/20. 
. Typically no single stock will crash the whole market Shucks, the present sounds like a mixture of all 3 of those precursors to the crashes:

- Tariffs - check
- Tech bubble - check
- Subprime crap - check plus add crypto NVDA will one day The CountryWide Mortgage failure was an interesting event. Surely one company can’t cause a recession I thought.  Wrong.  Tip of the iceberg with a mess beyond comprehension of the mortals I hang with.  

Today?  I catch articles that the commercial real estate loan sector is in a bad state.  Is it?  IDK.  Will a correction in that sector matter?  No idea. Countrywide and Bear Stearns definitely were the canaries and there was a constant barrage of euphoria in real estate and private equity deals hitting the WSJ. Blackstone, KKR, Apollo, etc were constantly in the news.

Kushner bought the most expensive building ever at that time 666 Fifth Ave. They say such large skyscraper deals happen at the top.

Btw I didn’t know it was Epstein who triggered the collapse of Bear Stearns by withdrawing 200m of investments in CDOs. Read his wiki, quite bizarre how he was connected to so many things. It's pretty hard to figure them out until you are underway. The GFC would have been a standard 2022 style correction bear market if it wasn't for all the mortgage exposure. You're never going to figure out who has what on their books to that degree because it's cross-hedged, leverage is unknown. It's one of the wild cards. A better example might be 2001 to 2002 where we had an equally devastating decline in equities and even worse in tech but people were generally alright. The scary part about 2001 and 2002 is the setup is not that much different from the one we are currently in. You had rampant speculation in tech stocks, earnings were accelerating, they were kind of laughable because many were like one cent per share but at any rate it was going from one to two to three. You also had a lot of unprofitable companies trading at ridiculous numbers. Today Tesla makes no sense, palantir makes no sense, Google does make sense, asml and applied materials make sense but you're beginning to see some scary things happen. UPS was one today. You know that company most of you don't pay attention to that delivers all your packages. They are taking a real hit in shipping volume and if shipping volume is down it means people are buying less . How long does that take to translate into the economy because also remember in 2001 the Fed was actively cutting rates. That particular market turned into more of a rotation though because housing and commodities began to boom. Everyone wanted to own steel in mine stocks, oil stocks. I'm not sure if that would happen this time but there would likely be some type of rotation and we have already seen some of the extremely speculative stocks like corweave go from $40 up to nearly $200 back down to $100. Then you think about the crypto market, if we put in a top on that towards the end of the year you actually might have a top in the market. That remains to be seen but it's a working theory that I'm keeping in the back of my head ""Gradually, then suddenly"" is a quote from Hemingway when one of his characters answered the question: ""How did you go bankrupt?""",93,0.83,115,0,highoncaffeine1,stocks,['TSLA'],market crashes happen hi ive started putting small amount money market past 2 years never actively followed question anyone remembers trading gfc dot com bubble bursting take market reconsider valued stocks example crash start one company crashing reminds people revalue holdings everything crash maybe jobs report worse expected hypothetically large stock like tsla disillusioned lot investors corrected significant margin potential ripple across entire market couldnt find much information surrounding questions elsewhere hoping could help paint picture least expect reasons one knows someone grandstanding 18 months later claiming saw coming listened happen lot different ways bubbles probably common reason 20002001 2008 also happened different ways 2001 market kinda working like supposed tosorting winners losers new glitzy sector housing bubble bursting 2008 wouldnt massive problem world wasnt relying bunch americans paying mortgages could retire great depression started market declining saw bunch governmentsthe us primarily among tariffing one another dragging global growth everything came crashing acts godcovid fits well wars though often good business unfortunately politics us goes mad decides default market would crash instantly federal reserve deliberately crash market raising interest rates really high like saw 80s also deflation though seems something mostly engineered economies exception japan ten years ago china right tesla going isnt going crash market tesla company feel like secretly know shitty company worth 30shareif edit point lot crashes take longer remember taking slowly kind thing great recession took year sp go top bottom hindsight always 2020 typically single stock crash whole market shucks present sounds like mixture 3 precursors crashes tariffs check tech bubble check subprime crap check plus add crypto nvda one day countrywide mortgage failure interesting event surely one company cant cause recession thought wrong tip iceberg mess beyond comprehension mortals hang today catch articles commercial real estate loan sector bad state idk correction sector matter idea countrywide bear stearns definitely canaries constant barrage euphoria real estate private equity deals hitting wsj blackstone kkr apollo etc constantly news kushner bought expensive building ever time 666 fifth ave say large skyscraper deals happen top btw didnt know epstein triggered collapse bear stearns withdrawing 200m investments cdos read wiki quite bizarre connected many things pretty hard figure underway gfc would standard 2022 style correction bear market wasnt mortgage exposure youre never going figure books degree crosshedged leverage unknown one wild cards better example might 2001 2002 equally devastating decline equities even worse tech people generally alright scary part 2001 2002 setup much different one currently rampant speculation tech stocks earnings accelerating kind laughable many like one cent per share rate going one two three also lot unprofitable companies trading ridiculous numbers today tesla makes sense palantir makes sense google make sense asml applied materials make sense youre beginning see scary things happen ups one today know company dont pay attention delivers packages taking real hit shipping volume shipping volume means people buying less long take translate economy also remember 2001 fed actively cutting rates particular market turned rotation though housing commodities began boom everyone wanted steel mine stocks oil stocks im sure would happen time would likely type rotation already seen extremely speculative stocks like corweave go 40 nearly 200 back 100 think crypto market put top towards end year actually might top market remains seen working theory im keeping back head gradually suddenly quote hemingway one characters answered question go bankrupt
1mcranr,2025-07-29,"Is Oklo/SMR/TerraPower the next NVDA/AMD/Intel?

Ok so here’s how I’m seeing it.
Everyone’s focused on $NVDA, $AMD, $INTC, but they’re just one piece of the whole puzzle. Here’s how I see it: AI needs constant computational and electrical power. Not just for the data centers and the fabs that make the chips, but the chips themselves burn power 24/7. The more models scale, the more energy they eat. That power has to come from somewhere. Big tech ceos are already talking about potential future power shortages if we dont come up with something better than what we have rn
So here’s how I’m thinking about it:
We started with AI companies throwing money at chip companies →chip companies throwing money at fabs like TSMC →fabs and AI centers pulling insane amounts of power off the grid →and now we’re about to see power companies (especially nuclear) get flooded with cash →and that means the uranium miners feeding those reactors are next in line.
This is how i see the chain:
AI companies → NVDA / AMD / INTC → TSMC / Samsung → SMRs like Oklo / SMR / TerraPower → uranium miners like UUUU / NXE / CCJ.
Every stage up the chain got paid. The last ones left to run are nuclear and uranium.
I think we’re about to see a repeat of the same pattern within the next few years as we experience energy shortage. Just like how NVDA and AMD dominated chips, I think a couple players will dominate nuclear. Right now we’ve got:
* Oklo (backed by Sam Altman, just IPO’d $10.5B)
* NuScale / SMR (~$6.8B)
* TerraPower (still private but Gates-backed and getting a ton of attention)
That’s probably the big 3. Others will show up, but like everything else, a couple names are going to take 80% of the market and leave everyone else behind.
Same goes for uranium. CCJ is the king, but NXE and UUUU are getting attention. Supply is tight, and if nuclear demand explodes, miners get squeezed upward just like GPU demand squeezed NVDA.
So yeah, are Oklo / SMR / TerraPower are the next NVDA / AMD / INTC  just further up the chain? The ones getting paid by the ones getting paid.
I’m looking at LEAP calls and they are not that expensive while they’re still under the radar. It’s the last piece of the AI/infrastructure puzzle that hasn’t run yet.
What do you guys think? Am I early? I just dropped a few grand on $UUUU and OKLO july 2026 calls so Im seaking guidance from fellow degenerates. Also I know were still years ahead of nuclear, but I have a big FOMO…
NVDA was already making billions in revenue before hitting hyperdrive, those companies don't even have revenue yet. OKLO and SMR pumped like crazy already. Smart money got in before that. Is oklo, the company that has already gone 7x with no revenue, the next nvda? I doubt it WTF ARE YOU ON?

NVDA had the GPU market cornered. GTX 1080 released in 2016, you may not have heard about it, but if you played games or ran visual software, you KNEW NVDA.

Thats why it exploded. it already had dominating market share, so when the wind started blowing it way, it shot for the moon. They’re already priced in for 2040 revenue. All those tickets will experience 80% draw downs over the next year Not a chance. Classic bubble stocks likely to burst before they have a realistic growth trajectory. Nah NVDA traded between 14 and 45x earnings not revenue for the majority of its early days. This is a classic bubble. We likely get an implosion at some point this year or next, and maybe some of these companies start to ramp revenue at a realistic valuation in 2027 2028 time. They are just speculative bets. The only one with a path to profitability is OKLO, which has a plant planned to be built (start breaking ground in 2026 iirc) outside of Boise and another plant  for an air force base in Alaska. OKLO also has their own uranium supply as well as a clear path towards regulatory approval.

SMR (nuscale) has intriguing designs, some major regulatory approvals have cleared, and no true plans or partnerships that have solidified any actual plants to be built. 

This is not the future NVDA, unless they are. I'd take 1000:1 odds that they are the next big thing. I agree with you that this country needs to learn in to high quality cleaner nuclear power, especially the unique breeder reactors. I agree that there's a lot of room for this space to grow. Will it grow though? It's all just a speculative gamble. Investing in nuclear right now (unless it's CEG or GEV) is basically like investing in early clinical phase biotech. High risk, high reward. CEG or GEV have a clear and boring path towards profitability. 

The biggest risks to OKLO or SMR (if they actually finally do clear all regulatory hurdles and actually build real plants) is that their initial promise if low cost electricity actually ends up being a higher than originally promised cost. Well, that's just one of the risks. If they can actually prove that nuclear power using these SMR designs is actually cheaper, yeah these could 3-5x in a couple years. OP is just spouting pumped names. NuScale is the only SMR company with a license and has failed projects due to costs and failed timelines. $6B market cap is still insane. 

Oklo is a pipe dream up 800% in a year on nothing but a CEO being on tv talking about “non binding partnerships” with zero dollars attached. People act like Sam Altman isn’t an angel investor who invests in hundreds of companies who fail. Oklo went public via SPAC because it couldn’t get funded privately. Has had 3 years to reapply for a license and hasn’t done it. Hasn’t updated timelines or project costs from SPAC slide deck. Reality is those projections are massively underestimated and will take much longer if ever up and running. It’s a novel reactor so regulatory hurdles will be even higher than any other SMR company. $11B market cap is laughable. 

TerraPower is the one bet I would make of the 3. Has a top ten richest human on earth backing them with a billion dollar investment already. They’ve broken ground and their website actually lays out real information about what they do and where they’re going. Applied for a construction permit already and their design is much simpler from a regulatory standpoint per their website. They still don’t see their project up and running until 2030 per again their website which is still early imo: again they’d be my pick if I had to pick form this group.

OP fails to understand that power is needed right now and the projects are still maybe a decade away. There are big players soaking up market share daily. Those are the ones who will benefit long term. They’ve been getting the contracts with real dollar figures attached. BWXT signed a $2.4B deal last week for example. Energy secretary said on the All In summit that natural gas would be powering the AI revolution. It’s the cheapest and most abundant minus solar but we know how the administration feels about solar.

1mcqnzm,2025-07-29,"Is it more complicated?
21 years old with one year of ""experience"" in investments I am trying to understand if UNH and NOVO NORDISK (here I am already -22%) are really an opportunity. The share prices of the two companies are the same as they were 2-3 years ago .I compare the financials of the two companies with the financials they had in 2021-2022 and they are clearly better and it seems based on the 2026-2027 forecasts that they will continue. So doesn't that mean that if we look at the long term 1-2 years not rushing to make a profit the prices of the two stocks should go up?
So why is the subreddit called ""Stocks"" and not ""index funds""? “Just a company in the space” …yeah this is why I never take this sub seriously.

For over 100 years Novo Nordisk has been in the insulin business with giant market shares in both diabetes treatment and weight loss. Their r&d team is the best in the world, and their manufacturing scale is second to none. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly will have a duopoly in the weight loss market just like they did with insulin. I’m talking 90% split between both of them while the real “just a company in the space” fight for the remaining 10%. So I ask you again, why isn't this subreddit called index founds? unh? probably. novo? probably not.

unh is the leader of their industry, and it's an industry that the country **needs** (and literally forces people to buy against their will in some states). they are  absolutely a ""too big to fail"" company and the healthcare sector will eventually swing back into favor.

novo nordisk is just a company in the space. there's nothing inherently special about them, and they have much more serious competition in their space. The foundation of a good personal portfolio is index funds. Individual stocks are awesome, that’s why we’re here. But when a 21 year old kid who has no idea what they’re doing is asking for stock advice, we should all be recommending that they build a foundation in indexes before picking individual stocks. Most of us have the disposable income and portfolio foundation, to take risks on individual stocks. It’s unlikely that OP does. UNH is being investigated. More people are also coming out to report how bad the insurance company is. Novo produces Ozempic and there are reports of bad side effects. The cuts to medicaid will affect insurance companies. The cuts to science research will affect pharmaceutical companies. If you want those two stocks, keep up to date on budget cuts and market sentiment. May take time to make money. I suggest VT or VOO if you don’t have the time to research individual stocks Exactly right There was someone that went into UNH calls in the other ""investing"" sub. It went real well!

1mcmbaw,2025-07-29,"Google’s “monopoly” breakup is a Swiss Cheese stance
How are people going to argue Google has a monopoly in search, and then the next post will say “Google search business at risk from OpenAI and other AI tools”. Make up your mind. 

There’s no way Alphabet will be broken up over them being a “monopoly”. FOH. 
My real issue here is that if you value the different business segments of Google it’s worth more than Google is worth today. There are undeniable benefits of everything being under the same company, but there are also some potential benefits of being broken up and out from under the thumb of a massive business that’ll cut spending on good products for no reason. 




If Google isn’t broken up, great it’s an amazing company and valuation should go up once it is settled.




If Google is broken up, great I know own parts of several amazing businesses that will likely start out at a higher cumulative value and then thrive for years. The search business isn’t even at risk. People need to get their head out of their ass. Ever heard of LLMs? What do people think AI gets info from? If it stays together I think AI will allow different google products to integrate with each other even better than they already do. There's so much potential for Google it's hilarious that some are scared of AI implications. It's like being scared of Apple in 1995 because Windows PCs were growing as the internet became mainstream. Standard Oil's market share had dropped from 91% to 64% **before** they were broken up in 1911.

I followed the *United States vs. Microsoft* on a free OS which worked way better than Windows.  Microsoft lost.  The case was overturned on appeal, but only for procedural reasons; the matter was eventually settled out of court.

What you think of as a monopoly has little to do with how an antitrust case is likely to go. I think this is an overblown and irrelevant ""concern"" that keeps getting repeated. Take a look at Google's financials last week. IMO, Google is going to profit from AI more than anyone. AI features mostly make SEO redundant, which Google does not make any money from, only marketing agencies.
If you wanna be visible next to AI summaries, you're gonna have to pay for Google Ads, which directly goes to Google. Guess what it searches with It doesn’t matter. The DOJ ruled Alphabet has a monopoly in the ads business, and that’s not very far from the truth, even with the LLMs disruption threat. 

But yes the LLMs threats can be used as arguments by Alphabet’s legal team. 

Will it be broken up ? I have no freaking clue, but I hold Alphabet and sometimes I wish it will be, that could unlock massive value. I wouldn’t be surprised if lot of institutional investors wish for a break-up too. FYI Microsoft was the one who bleed out Skype.

Google has definitely done the same but mostly with hardware like stadia or google home. Do you think Reddit is just one person posting?

1mcm7th,2025-07-29,"Spotify drops 11% for worst day in two years on weak guidance
Spotify shares dropped more than 11% Tuesday for their worst day since July 2023 after the music streaming service fell short of Wall Street’s expectations and posted weak guidance for the current quarter.

Here’s how the company did versus LSEG estimates:

* **Loss:** Loss of .42 euros vs. earnings of 1.90 euros per share expected
* **Revenue:** 4.19 billion euros vs. 4.26 billion expected

The Swedish platform’s revenues rose 10% from about 3.81 billion euros in the year-ago period. The company posted a net loss of 86 million euros, or a loss of .42 euros per share, down from net income of 225 million euros, or 1.10 euros per share a year ago.

Spotify said that higher personnel, marketing and professional services costs and 115 million euros worth of what it called social charges contributed to the results.

Third-quarter guidance came up short of Wall Street’s forecast.

The company expects revenues to reach 4.2 billion euros, compared to a 4.47 billion euro estimate from StreetAccount. Spotify said the forecast accounts for a 490-basis-point headwind due to foreign exchange rates.

Monthly active users on the platform jumped 11% to 696 million, while paying subscribers rose 12% from a year ago to 276 million. Ad-tier subscribers account for over 60% of Spotify’s monthly users.

For the current quarter, Spotify said it expects to reach 710 million monthly active users, with 14 million net adds. The company expects 5 million net new premium subscribers in the third quarter to reach 281 million subscriptions.

Spotify’s advertising-supported revenues declined about 1% to 453 million euros from 456 million euros a year ago. The company said it sees promise in its advertising stack and demand given its strong user base and will focus on adoption and new tools in the second half. Some areas of opportunity include business and automated ads.

“It’s really an execution challenge, not a problem with the strategy,” said CEO Daniel Ek during an earnings call. “While I’m unhappy with where we are today, I remain confident in the ambitions we laid out for this business, and we’re working quickly to ensure we’re on the right path.”

Ek said the company is seeing some “promising signs” in its programmatic business.

Multiple news outlets reported this week that Doordash had poached the company’s advertising head as chief revenue officer.

During the period, Spotify said it rolled out a request feature for its artificial intelligence DJ. The company said engagement with its AI DJ has roughly doubled over the last year. Its audiobooks feature expanded to four new countries during the quarter, and listening hours jumped 35% in the U.S., U.K. and Australia.

Earlier this year, an indie rock band on the platform known as Velvet Sundown gained media attention after it quickly captured over a million new listeners and raised questions over artificial intelligence use in music creation. The “band” was later confirmed to be mainly AI-generated after widespread speculation.

In 2024, Spotify posted its first full year of profitability as it slashed costs and hiked prices. Over the years, the company has prioritized subscriber gains and invested beyond music in podcasts and audiobooks. Apple Music remains one of its top competitors.

Spotify said it ended the quarter with more than 7,300 full-time employees and upped its share repurchase program by $1 billion. Shares are up more than 40% this year.

Spotify’s doesnt even know how to implement a working shuffle. 

I love spotify but im tired of hearing the same songs in a 1000 songs playlist! Used to work on the product team at Spotify— imho the only thing keeping them in business is its branding/name. I’ve never seen a company so bad at managing itself in my life and their corporate bureaucracy and internal politics impede them from growing in any meaningful way.

For instance, when I was there, the top priority was developing their new luxury tier called “Supremium,” which was set to cost $20 per month and feature high-quality audio and expanded data capabilities— however it was so poorly managed, it plummeted from the first priority to the sixteenth in 2024, and it has yet to be released; and they’ve been working on it for 3-4 years lmao Spotify is too cozy. They haven’t updated audio quality years after saying they would. Their shuffle and discovery is atrocious. And the competition is arguably outshining them. I hope they get the reality check they deserve Still seems pretty overvalued to me Yeah, I think their downfall will be not owning their content. 

Netflix was able to create a giant moat by owning one of the largest libraries of content, which led to more subscribers, more subscribers means more revenue, which meant more money to spend on more content, and so on (not sure if this is a flywheel or network effects or whatever).

Everything that I listen to on Spotify can be found on like 3 or 4 other apps (whether it's podcasts or music). 

This model means that Spotify is simply a middleman that gets squeezed from both ends - Creators want a bigger cut and consumers want to pay as little as they can. 

UX and inertia can help keep people around, but it's gonna put a ceiling on Spotify's valuation, which should be a heck of a lot less than Netflix. Youtube Music does the same shit to me. I have tested this. Try the same 100 It seems….intentional? Like, if I download an album and just shuffle my whole library it will only ever play the singles and hits. Feels to me like the app is trying to maintain my engagement by only playing the best of the best. I wish I could view stats like “how many times his track has been played” because I know for damn sure “Schism” has played 30 times for every “Mantra”. Nonetheless i cleared my cache and am hoping for the best. This is not shocking. Also Spotify is a software solution platform that doesn't own anything. They will always have to rely on labels/right holders, who own the masters.

1mck70z,2025-07-29,"The rally is losing steam, I'm watching these levels for SPY & QQQ
I'm sure many of you folks are thinking the same -- this rally seems irrational. If you zoom out on either SPY or QQQ you'll see how the slope of the line is very gradual for the last one month or so. The volatility has been very low, and the supports are also very tight. Everyone has their own way to chart and determine breakouts, but these are my levels. 

SPY: $627.10  
QQQ: $563.50

As you can see, we're \~1% away from these levels. I will be watching if the respective underlying ETFs have a \*daily close\* below these levels. If they do, there is a possibility that a downtrend might start. 

I've been watching the charts (SPY, QQQ, futures etc) for months, and this is NOT a 'trust me bro' kinda post. The tools are use are purely mathematical and do not have any bias (like analysts do).

Edit: Since every comment is ridiculing me, I'm going to keep monitoring my support levels, and *if* they're broken, I will post again with my short / put position.
Note: I have NOT said that the market has already started a reversal. I'm merely sharing with the group, the levels that *I am* monitoring. Did I suggest that you short the market? No! Then have some respect, and give the benefit of doubt. Who knows!? I might be the guy who predicted the timing of the next crash before anyone else could! 😉 (well take this in a lighter vein, you fuckers!)

I’m just reading your post about the market only doing dead cat bounces and falling and people panic selling to meet basic needs. So maybe you were buying during that time.

1mcinlc,2025-07-29,"What is the current sentiment for the future of healthcare?
Personally Healthcare is around 22% of my portfolio so ive taken a big hit recently but generally believe it will rally back. Though the market doesnt seem to believe that - i also have concerns with the big beautifull bill where UNH will lose alot of potential earnings and theyve lowered forecasts, also with Novo Nordisk who has also lowered forecasts, they are the ones that made me take the biggest hit. 

it seems like the market has a very negative sentiment on healthcare.

Rule 1: I own Novo and UNH which together adds up to around 22% of my portfolio.
The valuations right now look very attractive. Meanwhile every single other asset class and sector is overextended. Be greedy when others are fearful. There’s so much negative sentiment around NVO and UNH that this is when you buy for long term holds.

Short term, both could suffer more. But long term, NVO will continue to have its patent in the USA until 2031, and UNH is too big to fail. And again, when there’s an overwhelming negative sentiment, that’s when it’s a good entry point to buy So you never had an investment fall more than 10% the past 4 years? There is still a lot of damage trump can do in 3 and a half years to health care. Remember this is early

Holy Shit! That is a lot of 'buying'! Dude, STFU. Too big to fail. Largest health insurer in the United States. Very oversold right now. Proper value is high 300s/low 400s >because some random dude on internet was yelling ""overvalued"".

LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO you can't be serious Of the last 10 trades of UNH stock involving people in congress or senate only 3 have been purchases although confusingly Ro Khana sold and bought back the stock on the same day 

According to the SEC since start of 2025 of the 6 insider transactions on UNH stock 5 have been purchases and 1 has been a sale 

Overall this presents a very juxtaposing overview - in general I think the stock will recover but there's a bumpy road ahead

Hello everyone

I would like to start with thanking you all for the amazing information on this sub.

I’m 31M in a 2nd world country. Happens that in the last 8 years I’ve been buying 500 usd of MSFT stock because I strongly believe in it.

Also reinvested dividends into buying more stock in the last years

For the first time I will have to sell some shares for a person project in the next month.

The results are tomorrow after market.

Question:
Should I sell today or August 1st? I think earnings will beat but already priced in

Don’t judge me. My portfolio is 100% Microsoft but I did an all in

Current position: 
150k - around 300 stocks
If you’re looking to close your position, why don’t you sell 3 calls? lol I hope you held onto your shares! This is an excellent suggestion, OP. If you have time you may get enough cash via premium, if you don't have time you could sell ITM and pretty much guarantee you get enough for what you need Yeah I did! If u think they have higher earning and tariffs won’t hurt them then wait if not sell Very good that you decided to hold. It's the same for me, I'm gonna sell my very positive options in the coming minutes (I think xD) I’m expecting them to boom with the china deal.

1mce57d,2025-07-29,"Meta Capex and Opex will shake Wallstreet to the core.
(post translate and enhanced with AI) 

The AI fever continues driving the market to record highs.

After blowing through $60 billion on the Metaverse, Zuckerberg is now racing to lead the charge for super intelligence and infinite gains.

While I'm somewhat skeptical about this strategy of hiring a bunch of rockstar researchers who have never worked together and expecting them to perform miracles, we all have to admire Zuck's boldness.

But my point here is about whether Wall Street truly understands the magnitude of spending that Meta is committing to, and how this will affect financial results in the coming months and years.

I can't think of any similar example other than Meta itself between 2019 and 2022 with the Metaverse. And even this seems to be an order of magnitude larger.

Perhaps a similar positive example would be Microsoft's pivot to the Cloud in 2012. But in that situation, there was only one major competitor (AWS).

To wrap up: I expect that tomorrow we'll see much stronger movements in companies like Nvidia, AMD, Dell, IBM on the upside and Google and Oracle on the downside.


The Big Beautiful Bill’s impact on capex to cash flow will be a tailwind to earnings You are mistaking desperation for boldness, if they don’t come out on top for an AI they are done Companies can expense 100% in year one rather than a phased schedule. That will impact earnings near-term One of the few Reddit posts about earnings that actually aged well, you ended up being pretty spot on. After today I think I’m gonna back up the truck for META, big things ahead for them. what is new, previously it was metaverse now new. does this AI generate ads or fills up more AI genrated content for photo, video modification This aged like Milk. They are pumping 12 and 8% AH, META and MSFT, while dragging NVDA and AMD with them can you go more in depth into this? curious thanks Expense or depreciate?

Depreciating the year an asset is put in service is wild and makes no real world sense but ok whatever. Wall St needs is numbers to go in one direction.

Getting the R&D credit back as it was is more important. Spreading R&D opex as if it's capex I just have no idea what anyone was thinking there. They aren’t playing games. The US public company accounting reporting and auditing standards weed a lot of this out if it happens in a material way. Meta is making more money than ever. This is due to advertisers having more success with customers buying their products from ads run on Meta’s platforms.

1mccmzq,2025-07-29,"Better to swap NVDA with AMD?
I mean let’s be honest Nvidia is at like 4.3 trillion mc and the chances of it doubling in the next year or two is almost negligible ? I’m wondering if I swap my NVDA with amd and amd is showing a promising company now with their cost effective high performance chips coming out. And most importantly the chances of amd doubling is way higher than NVDA right now as their mc is only like 300b. Let me know your thoughts
Hahah god this sub. Where were you 2 months ago? Buy high baby Advanced money doubler why not just hold both?  jensen is a true visionary.   Lisa is good at operational excellence. 2I have to disagree with what seems to be the popular consensus: Don't swap NVDA with AMD until AMD's fundamentals start outperforming NVDAs, which may never happen on a consistent basis. 

First, having been in the market for decades, an excellent good strategy is to buy the leader and hang on as long as they are the leader, which can last for decades. More often than not, Company A is actually ""The Next Company A."" This means you buy google, even though it is expensive, rather than Alta Vista or Go2net. This means you buy apple (back when they were growing) instead of Sprint or Cingular, thinking they will be the next apple. This means you buy AMZN and not Chewey or upstart.com. If you have 5-10% of your assets in Crypto, you buy the top-tier coins and stay away from S###coins. 

Novice investors look at the chart of the leader, see how much it has gone up, and rationalize that they missed the boat and think that maybe number 2 or 3 will outperform. Number 2 and 3 will have their prices outperform in extreme bull runs, but they will dramatically underperform as soon as the trend breaks. 

Right now, NVDA has higher margins than AMD, sequential-quarter revenue growth of 13% rather than 8%, and a far better software stack. You might think: I can buy an AMD GPU with better RAM and compute/$ and save money, for a stock, that's not the flex you think it is. All of the CUDA libraries are worth something. ROCM should work, but AMD should have started the ROCM effort as soon as NVDA started CUDA. For every dollar NVDA spends right now, NVDA makes more dollars than AMD and they have more dollars to invest in new architectures, joining more chips together, more light-based data processing, and hopefully more ASICs if NVDA wants to compete against Google and AVGO (also own both). And actually, I think google+avgo has the potential to be an NVDA killer down the road, though I don't see either company outperforming regarding fundamentals in the near term. 

For the last two years, people have been telling me that their DD has revelaed that AMD has a better forward PE than NVDA, stuff isn't being accounted for in the leading stats yada, yada. I just haven't seen it. AMD has had misses and delays. 

But, it's not like I'm not watching AMD, and as a data-driven investor I will pivot if they pull a miraculous rabbit out of their hat and start **growing faster**. I just haven't seen any rabbits yet. Where were you in March/April? Like to buy high and sell low, eh? Sell high, buy high. AMD’s upside is just so much more realistic right now, especially with their traction in AI inference. Feels like we’re still early in the re-rating phase.

1mcb2zr,2025-07-29,"Microsoft in talks to continue access to OpenAI technology
Just saw a news item that Microsoft is in talks with OpenAI about continued access to the technology.

This could be a big deal for both companies, it's all about what they talk about.

Microsoft and OpenAI are in talks to continue working together to use their technology, something that could impact the next phase of the AI industry. Something to watch.

Let's be honest, Microsoft has long invested heavily in OpenAI, and with ChatGPT's integration with their Azure, it's basically become a standard solution for enterprise AI. If this time around, they're renegotiating the partnership or expanding it, it could mean:

Deeper bindings to OpenAI technology

Priority or exclusive access to future GPT releases

A possible new structure for the licensing model

A strategic moat against Google, Meta, and Amazon.

Of course, it could also mean that OpenAI is getting stronger and doesn't want to be completely dependent on Microsoft for dominance.

Would like to hear everyone's thoughts:

Is it good for Microsoft in the long run?

Will it affect OpenAI's independence or future valuation?

Are we underestimating Microsoft's current position at the heart of AI?

If you were holding Microsoft right now, would you choose to “add to your position on the low side” with this news?
I'll take the opposite view though it probably won't be popular. I don't think Microsoft should be so reliant on OpenAI. They're up the creek now, either way.

1mcazwk,2025-07-29,"(07/29) Sarepta Surges - Interesting Stocks Today
Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [Union Pacific to acquire Norfolk Southern in 85 Billion Deal](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-29/union-pacific-to-acquire-norfolk-southern-in-85-billion-deal?srnd=homepage-americas)

[**SRPT (Sarepta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SRPT&p=d)\-The FDA concluded ""the death of an 8-year-old in Brazil was unrelated to ELEVIDYS treatment and has recommended that Sarepta resume shipments for ambulatory individuals with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy"". This has caused the stock to surge afterhours yesterday. Interestingly, the stock was worth $35 before the ELEVIDYS news even happened, but we haven't resurged. So I'm a little wary of this because we haven't been going back all the way. Worth watching at the open. 

Edit: From a tweet I read, this is because ""FDA backs Sarepta's Elevidys again in ambulatory Duchenne patients but addressed none of the 3 deaths that actually triggered the agency's earlier request for a shipment pause."", so that explains why we're not all the way back yet. 

[**UNH (UnitedHealth)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UNH&p=d)\-UnitedHealth issued a revised 2025 adj. earnings guidance of $16 per share, below the expectations of $20.40. The company also reported Q2 adjusted EPS of $4.08 on revenue of $111.6B, missing expectations. Overall not interested in this unless we hit near lows again of $250 again, which was the max pain point from the UnitedHealth facing DOJ investigation over Medicare billing catalyst in the past. I'm not too interested in a swing trade otherwise, there are just so many different factors in this stock that I want to stay hands-off unless we have a ridiculous down day like in May.[](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/24/unitedhealthcare-doj-investigation-medicare-billing.html)

[**NVO (Novo Nordisk)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVO&p=d)\-Novo Nordisk has cut its full-year 2025 U.S. sales growth outlook to 8%-14% from 13%-21% and lowered operating profit forecast to 10%-16% from 16%-24%. Additionally, the company appointed a new CEO (Maziar Mike Doustdar) Maziar Mike Doustdar as the new CEO, effective August 7. From what I've read online, many people expected the CEO to be an American (because the main market for the weight-loss drugs is America because our obesity rate is so high). But I doubt that's a major factor in affecting stock price. We've essentially bled from 70 ->50 and had a slight bounce intraday, so I'm interested to see if we sell off again at the open/during market hours.

for all you gamblers out there, $SRPT is the play for you

their drug has always been controversial because the drug has never met its primary endpoint in its clinical trials but was fast-track approved due to patient advocacy groups influencing the previous FDA chair who swear they are seeing improvements in their children's lives from the drug

the current FDA director has voiced numerous concerns about the drug's approval before his position and it seems he is waging war against the company. there's a real possibility that the FDA may go through all the legal ways to withdraw approval for this drug. then there's also the very real possibility that the FDA loosens their stance and the drug can continue being sold and valuation multiples expand to historical levels

the company is 100% dependent on this drug being able to be sold - without it, they will go bankrupt as they were knee deep in debt and without the cash flows to sustain operations, they'll be gone in 2 years

the stock will either be zero or 4x from these levels. gambler's dream it's 50/50

1mc7l9r,2025-07-29,"Markets rose slightly after Trump announced a U.S.-EU trade deal with 15% tariffs on most European goods and a global tariff rate of 15–20%.
The broad market index’s initial moderate gains earlier in the day followed President Donald Trump’s announcement Sunday that the U.S. has struck a trade deal with the European Union, an agreement that will impose 15% tariffs on most goods imported from Europe, including automobiles. The president also said Monday that the baseline global tariff rate will be “in the range of 15 to 20%.”  
  
While investors effectively looked past the U.S.-EU trade deal, they will be watching for any other potential deals between the U.S. and other countries, such as China, to be announced by Friday’s tariff deadline. Top U.S. and Chinese officials met in Stockholm Monday for another round of trade talks. F, BGM, GM, TSLA, and HON will benefit from this as trade dynamics and tariff shifts reshape the global automotive and manufacturing sectors.  
  
Tariffs and inflation will remain a focal point throughout the week in other areas as well. The Federal Reserve is set to offer its decision on interest rates Wednesday following its two-day policy meeting. Central bank policymakers are widely expected to keep rates steady at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%
We (EU) folded too easily. Didnt even try to push it lower. Ding-ding-ding. Without a clear unified foreign policy, the EU will remain on the backfoot compared to other great powers.

Europeans like to joke about how divided the US is, but on the supranational level I'd argue the EU is just as divided, if not more. Americans getting a national sales tax through executive orders. Congrats to the land of the free with ""separation of power"". tariffs are trade barriers, and will slow down economic activity. However, market is desensitized and won't wake up until we see a dip in earnings, GDP, or employment rate. No news matter. It's just up and up. If they tried to push it lower it would drag the negotiations. Imagine second round of talks but with Orban, Meloni and every European far-right barking their little heads off in the background. 

In the current political setup EU has no negotiating power as it's never clear who is actually ruling it. IMO European leaders simply decided fighting it isn't worth it and they're betting on a Democratic controlled Congress after the midterms. yeah, nothing really matters anymore, it's just inflation.

Really, the dollar has been devalued by 10%, so the market has room to run to 10% past it's previous highs, so it probably has \~8% more to go. Really the response needs to be with trade going to free-trade friendly trading partners like Canada. Just cut the US out as middle-man and see the overall trade numbers with the US steeply decline. 

The US doesn’t really “produce” anything of value. They just buy in bulk from Canada and Mexico, maybe add some value (ie refine oil products, mill lumber from Canadian forests etc), then export. 

But I wonder if this is the overall long term goal. To alienate the states from its allies, cripple its economy and undermine their seat at the head of the global stage.

1mc4mo8,2025-07-29,"Is Google's every Tech Company bigger competitor?
I just realized that Google is typically the primary or secondary threat for almost every major tech company I can think of. 

Think about the combined market cap of the competitors, is the market undervaluing Google?

* Tesla – Waymo + Google AI
* Apple – Android + Google Search
* Microsoft – Google Workspace + Google Cloud + Google Search
* Amazon – Google Shopping + Google Cloud
* Nvidia – Google TPU
* Meta – YouTube + Google Ads + Google AI
* AMD – Google TPU

* Zoom – Google Meet
* OpenAI – Gemini
* TikTok (ByteDance) – YouTube
There is one segment that Google doesn't compete in which is gaming. I'm not sure if this counts as tech because it's more so entertainment. But Microsoft and Sony are both in this realm. They never joined the console wars and I know Stadia failed. There is a segment that is widely overlooked when it comes to google. And that is the power of google maps. 

A lot of car manufacturers still use their inhouse OS, with their inhouse gps. And needless to say, compared to google OS and google maps, it’s usually always crappy. Polestar, Volvo, Ford, Honda, Renault, Nissan, GMC and a bunch of other american brands have already started using google OS in their infotainment system. 

I remember when smart phones first entered the market, every brand had their own OS. Now it’s only android and IOS. Now that a car is basically a smartphone on wheels, i suspect the same thing will happen with car OS.  Google definitely has an edge there since plenty of car manufacturers have already started using their OS and they don’t have any competitors yet. I highly suspect Apple will come to the table but they haven’t started yet. Stadia was fun while it lasted PE ratio of 19 They tried with Stadia but nobody remembers that because it flopped hard. Google was right to pivot away from it.

I think they only want to compete in a field if they can be the No. 1 or No. 2 player.

Gaming is too saturated and you can't ever grab a majority of the market. Also, look at Sony. One massive flop like Concord and they lost $400 million.

I'd like to see them try to get deeper into cybersecurity and possibly even energy. Dibs on tomorrow's turn to post ""is Google undervalued?"" This is factually incorrect for multiple reasons:
1) Google's revenue has substantially increased since the release of ChatGPT.
2) The LLMs you're using, are using Google in the background.
3) Google is the leader in AI anyways. Yes. Google is the beast amongst beasts. It is ridiculously undervalued when compared to the other Mag 7, and has way more cash to invest than others.

The reason why it is priced lower than others is mainly because it doesn't have a super hyped media platform, a scandalous CEO or huge promises that it may never achieve - it is a very ""quiet"" beast.

I believe it is the most stable across the mag7, with a constant and steady growth for years to come. Now - whether that translates to stock value... Depends on the hive mind really. And the crazies don't really follow logic \**looks at TSLA*\* Imo this should have always been the apple car project.

1mc1fz7,2025-07-29,"What makes Google so low?
Google consistently posts massive profits and yet its PE is around 20, which is much lower than other big tech names that sit at 40+, Tesla with a PE near 180, and PLTR up in the 600s.  
  
If we go by valuation multiples alone, Google should easily be trading above $380. What's happening?
From my understanding it’s regulation overhang, and risk to their search business being disrupted by AI. 

DOJ is set to make a hearing on chrome in the next 2 months, so might alleviate some of the sentiment regarding the business. Google narrative is that ChatGPT will continue to eat away at the search business which is the core profit center for Google. And that they will face immense antitrust pressure from govt in the next decade. 

TSLA is very disconnected from financials and is a speculative bet that they become a 10 trillion dollar company through Autonomous robots + AI  + Self driving 

Pltr is also disconnected from financials and is the market trying to price the value of deep deep government integrations like we’ve never seen before. 

Overall I think Google is the biggest smash buy out of any big tech companies. Search + GCP + YouTube give it a really high floor. Waymo + Alpha Fold + AI products + TPU give it a lot of room to grow. Ive been buying for years and keep adding more This is one major reason for the low price. The government found them guilty of being a monopoly in two different markets. And threatening to force them to sell chrome, could cost them to lose 30% of the search business. Right at the same time people will think AI will replace search, and search is the majority of their total revenue. People think chatgpt will steal Google traffic. The market is probably also punishing Google for not being on the 'forefront' of this whole gpt stuff even though they pioneered a lot of this. 

Personally, I'm long on Google and it is one of my larger positions. Relatively compared to the other tech companies, Google's PE is ridiculous. Or maybe the others are? You get the point. Who would they lose the search business to? People will use Google regardless of Chrome or any deals Just wait until the search AI's are prompted to guide your attention to preferenced results. Like a personal shopper that cuts deals with retailers. The AI replacing search is the main explanation.

If you look at Baidu (the Chinese Google), it has significantly underperformed the other Chinese stocks.

I personally think those concerns are overblown. I haven’t used Google less since ChatGPT came out. I most use ChatGPT for research and Google when I’m looking for something. ChatGPT is terrible for search as it clutter your query history( queries you want to revisit) and it takes long time to respond 
. Google is essentially an ad business based on the clicks. With Ai, you don't have to click on the website anymore and will no longer be bombarded with ads. Why use the google search bar when you can use an Ai wrapper like perplexity that will spit out the answer for you devoid of google ads. You will only have to click on sites if you really want to through the footnotes. 25 is fine for GOOGL (PE). Most of the issues are overblown. Get as much as you can in before it hits 220-240 The market is slow at realizing reality, google is building out AI under the radar while many dip shit analysts are worried about the DOJ noise that will end up being a slap on the wrist and some chump change to them.

1mbhncr,2025-07-28,"Trump: “China Deal Is Close” Ahead of EU and Stockholm Trade Talks  Tariffs, Semis, and Rare Earths on the Table


US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that an agreement with China was “basically” reached, although details remain unclear. His remarks came ahead of high-level talks between China and the US scheduled for Monday in Stockholm, with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and US Treasury Secretary Scott Pritzker set to lead the discussions.

Extension of the US-China tariff truce agreement (set to expire in mid-August)

U.S. pressure on China over fentanyl and oil imports from sanctioned countries

Rare earths: China's key bargaining chip; critical for electric vehicles, wind energy, and defense technology

Washington's ongoing restrictions on semiconductors related to artificial intelligence

Meanwhile, the EU has accepted a 15% tariff agreement and committed to investing $600 billion, indicating that Trump's hardline trade policy is escalating once again.

If negotiations fail, new tariffs on China's semiconductor, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical industries could take effect by the end of the third quarter.

Markets may not react strongly in the short term, but if tariffs are reimposed, this could severely impact chip manufacturers, multinational corporations, and industrial firms with business ties to China.

I thought there was already a china deal latest news is if Putin does not cease fire in 10-12 days, Trump is placing secondary tariffs of 100% on countries buying Russian product ie oil. China is buying Russian Oil below market value because it helps them economically and slowly make Russia a weaker country in the long run.

  
100% tariffs, could possibly get China to make Putin stop but I would not bet on it.

PS, tariffs are product leaving China and I do not think a majority of the technology in the technology arena is leaving China. framework for discussions of a memorandum of understanding on a deal it was a ""framework"" deal My head hurts If your are the sole producer of a product that US is importing and needs, tariffs dont matter because you are not paying it and US still needs to buy it. It’s obviously an understanding of a deal that is based on the framework of previous concepts of a deal that can be changed at any minute for any reason. Fentanyl is the reason but also manufacturing and sometimes its a trade deficit. Overall it is better not to ask questions of the master business man, just accept that this is an excellent way to do business.   Im tired boss.

Tesla basically erasing its losses from an absolutely awful earnings is so fucking absurd. Google and Tesla are now both trading at roughly -2% since their Q2 earnings report. This is a sign that I don't understand anything about how the world works. All these trade deals are awful compared to the pre-Liberation Day status quo. Google's forward PE of 20 is clearly too high Low PE = no hyPE = no gainz = bad buy  
  
Ultra high PE = hyPE = GAINZ = must buy  
  
Am I starting to understand how to invest correctly? I do not get the air taxi hype. People are acting like this kind of thing has never been done before, there is no comparison, and that it's paradigm shifting.

I live in a coastal city with float plane service to the other major cities in the area. It's very convenient, downtown to downtown. Walk on and you're there in about 20 minutes.

To make this profitable, it costs about $120 one way, on a plane that takes 15-20 people. I don't know what the margins are here but I imagine not huge.

At that price, there is limited appeal. You can sometimes get standby for cheaper. Ferries are another option, or airport to airport service. So I don't know, are people suddenly going to be about paying whatever it is that Archer is going to require to be profitable, so they can sit alone?

Does anybody want all this flying over their house? Is it going to pass any kind of regulation? Trump is saying the baseline tariffs will be 15-20%. If our economy turns squirrely, then Trump Tariffs will be named in the same breath as Smoot-Hawley. In fact, they are very similar:

>The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 raised the average tariff on dutiable imports to nearly 60%, a significant increase from the 40% average before the act. This dramatic increase in tariffs was intended to protect American industries and farmers, but it ultimately led to a global trade war and worsened the Great Depression. 

Trump's tariff will be a 20% increase...just like Smoot. However, it looks like all the other countries aren't going to fight a dumb trade war so we probably will avoid a Great Depression, but probably get stagflation instead.

1mbgfim,2025-07-28,"Geopolitical Alert: Trump Warns Iran Not to Restart Nuclear Program Should We Watch Oil & Gas and Military Stocks?
Trump just spoke out and warned Iran not to restart its nuclear program. While this isn't the first time US-Iran relations have been strained, given his current favorability ratings in the 2024 election, this kind of statement could trigger some reaction in the market - especially in the energy and military sectors.

 Directions to watch: 

Crude Oil (WTI / Brent): oil price volatility could increase if the situation escalates. Iran remains an important player in the Middle East.

Energy stocks (XLE, OXY, XOM, CVX): these targets may react quickly to news changes.

Military stocks (LMT, RTX, NOC): these tend to gain market attention when geopolitical tensions are high.

Gold / Silver: Precious metals may act as a short-term hedge in times of market jitters.

 Macro perspective: 

If tensions continue to escalate, this could cause markets to enter “risk aversion mode”, with short-term flows to safer assets such as the US dollar and gold.

If oil prices rise, it may also affect the market's expectations of inflation.

Open discussion: 

Have you considered geopolitical risk in your current trading strategy?

Has anyone already laid out a position in the energy/military sector?

Could this be just a political statement and not really have much impact on the market?
The EU has set August 29 as a deadline for Tehran to show progress on containing its nuclear program. If Iran fails to comply, the EU plans to reinstate UN sanctions. This could trigger an escalation around that time mainly impacting oil and gas stocks. Oh no, more of Donnie’s peace bombs! What you said makes sense, but it’s important to remember that a lot of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure has already been targeted. If the U.S. truly wanted a direct conflict, they would’ve escalated during the recent regional tensions. Instead, they chose to pause and avoid a full confrontation. That tells me we’re heading back into the cycle of pressure through sanctions and diplomacy rather than outright war. At least for now.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/stocks) if you have any questions or concerns.* it will be months if not years about the progress or lack of it in fission development. This is a good thread for my Beijing tea party theory:

Japan and China, combined hold sn a enormous amount of debt, having not always been the best of friends. Current administration has made them closer. Japan has outright threatened to dump treasury bonds on the open market. If he becomes too much of an asshole, China has gone from over 1 trillion to around 980 billion in T-bills since November

The most obvious choice for them to unwind their position would be the euro 

However, another complication comes into the fold, which is the oil and gas market. Considering oil is traded in the US dollar which is why China likes to keep our debt if they got mad enough to start dumping T-bills like it was Boston harbor the dollar goes through the roof gas is $12 a gallon overnight because we all know it reacts faster to the upside when there’s a crisis


Now we come to the meat and potatoes of my theory, which is basically the dark horse for where they’ve been going, as they’ve been unwinding their dollar position .

During the last administration when he began his trade war prequel, China had a little bit of a soybean crisis. They decided to replace their US soybeans with Brazilian soy beans, who, ironically is pretty much the new lead contributor to the new BRICS movement, which he hates so much I remember a few weeks ago there was a massive insider trade on the Brazilian real it was in the opposite direction of what the theory would be expecting, but it had to do with an insider Trump announcement, so it doesn’t affect the actual theory


Bonus idea : Brazil is also in the oil and gas business and if you were interested in doing a hybrid investment of the Brazilian currency and oil and gas outside of the Middle East, you could look at Petrobras(Pbr)

I think it kind of works as a hedge against the dollar or whatever the hell happens with oil and gas because it’s a bricks Ally pretty much no matter what happens Markets just went up. TACO Hopefully... I am not a friend of trading conflicts actively but as a trader I also want to avoid keeping  positions like shorts on oil on the mid term.

1mbfy79,2025-07-28,"Why Redwire Could Be One of the Most Undervalued Plays in Space, Defense, and AI Going Into 2026: $1B+ Is in Sight Sooner Than You Think
Redwire is quietly assembling the holy trinity of future tech: **Space infrastructure, AI-driven mission systems, and autonomous defense platforms**. After digging through SEC filings, DoD roadmaps, company presentations, earnings calls, RFPs and defense budget line-items, etc. I genuinely believe 2026 will be the turning point, after Edge autonomy is fully integrated and revenues finally break the $1 billion barrier.

**Here’s a breakdown by segment:**

# 1. Core Space & Commercial Contracts (~$500M+)

* **NASA, ESA, and Gateway projects**: Ongoing space infrastructure work includes solar arrays, modular structures, payload services, and ISS/Gateway support. These contracts are multiyear and locked in. → **Estimated 2026 revenue: $220M–$260M**
* **DeepSat & VLEO satellite programs**: Redwire’s AI-powered digital engineering suite (Acorn 2.0, DEMSI) is powering the next-gen Earth intelligence constellations. The commercial + defense dual-use value here is growing. → **Est. 2026: $100M–$140M**
* **Space servicing, robotics, in-orbit manufacturing (Archinaut, payload integration, etc.)**: RDW is one of the few players with actual flight heritage. → **Est. 2026: $80M–$120M**

# 2. Defense Related (Edge Autonomy) (~$200M+)

* **Edge Autonomy’s Drone platforms**: U.S. Marine Corps visit last week, partnerships, and modular drone production give Edge a key role in the drone race. → **Est. 2026**: **$180M–$250M**
* **AI payloads & systems**: Defense customers increasingly need smart, modular payloads with in-orbit/real-time data processing. RDW is already delivering.

# 3. Major Defense Initiatives (Potential Windfalls)

* **SHIELD (U.S. Missile Defense Agency – $151B IDIQ)** Redwire is a top digital integrator candidate for SHIELD, a 10-year missile defense architecture focused on AI and multi-domain ops. Redwire’s edge in model-based systems engineering and space-based sensors positions it for repeat task orders. → **Est. 2026 revenue: $130M–$250M**
* **Golden Dome / NATO Missile Defense Integration** Edge Autonomy’s modular drones and Redwire’s sensor payloads align well with NATO missile defense requirements. NATO’s expanded investment strategy (\~$100B+ in new EU-NATO air defense cooperation) increases the likelihood of Edge/Redwire tech integration. → **Est. 2026 revenue: $60M–$100M**
* **U.S. “Unleashing American Drone Dominance” Initiative (FY2026 DoD Budget: $1.01T)** The U.S. military’s sharp focus on modular Drones, smart payloads, and speed-to-field gives Edge Autonomy a prime role. Redwire’s AI-driven mission systems could scale across platforms. → **Est. 2026 revenue: $90M–$130M**
* **EU Defense & Space Surge: €131B Allocation (2028–2034)** On July 17, 2025, the European Commission proposed a €2 trillion ($2.31T) EU budget for 2028–2034. Crucially, it includes €131 billion earmarked for defense and space, a fivefold increase over current levels. Additionally, a new €451B European Competitiveness Fund will support dual-use industries like satellites and AI payloads. Redwire’s expanding European footprint and NATO linkages make it well-positioned to benefit. → **Est. 2026 revenue (early access + ramp-up): $40M–$80M**
* **Trump-EU Arms Procurement Continuity** The Trump-era U.S.–EU defense deal includes “hundreds of billions” in new EU purchases of U.S. military equipment. Redwire’s and autonomy platforms are ideal for this transatlantic arms buildup. → **Est. 2026 revenue: $30M–$60M**

# 4. Software, AI, and Classified Work (High Margin)

* **Digital Engineering Platforms (Acorn 2.0, DEMSI)** These are becoming the backbone for both satellite and defense mission planning. → **Est. 2026**: **$40M–$60M**
* **Classified payloads and integration work** Indications from filings and DoD partnerships suggest growing classified backlog. → **Est. 2026: $30M–$60M**

# 5. Strategic Assets, IP, and Non-Recurring Revenue

* **Patents & IP Licensing**: Redwire owns critical IP in 3D printing in microgravity (Archinaut), space-rated materials, digital mission engineering tools (Acorn 2.0), and autonomous systems. Licensing or IP monetization (especially in allied countries ramping defense production) could generate non-linear returns. → **Est. 2026: $20M–$40M**
* **One-off or Non-Recurring Government Grants**: Given the surge in public-private space and biotech investments (e.g., autonomous bio payloads, ISS commercialization), Redwire may secure one-time grants or milestone payments. → **Est. 2026**: **$10M–$30M**
* **Strategic JVs or Divestitures**: Redwire could form joint ventures in Europe, spin off commercial units (e.g., in-orbit manufacturing), or license key tech to allies. → **Est. 2026: $25M–$50M**

**Estimated RDW Revenue by Source for 2026**

|Source|Estimated Revenue Range (Million USD)|
|:-|:-|
|Strategic IP / Grants / Spinouts|30 – 50|
|Pharma / Autonomous Bio Projects|20 – 40|
|European ISR / Space-Based Missile Defense Support|60 – 120|

|USMC / ISR Navy Missions (Speculative)|40 – 90|
|Other Space Infra & Payloads|60 – 100|
|Commercial / LEO Missions|60 – 100|
|**Total Estimated Revenue Range**|**1,170 – 2,010** **Billion**|

**This estimated revenue is meant to capture a full range from a conservative speculation to a bullish one. If you spot anything I have overlooked, let me know. I’ll happily update it.**

|2028|$1.6B–$2.0B|6×–10×|$9.6B–$20.0B|**+319% to +773%**|

# Why This Matters

* **Q2 Earnings will show the first signs of operating leverage.**
* **Free cash flow flips positive by 2025-end**, accelerating into 2026.
* **AI + Defense + Space = Holy Trinity of Multiples**
* **Low float + high institutional interest** = re-rating catalyst
* Market cap as of today is **$2.29 billion!!!**

**If 2026 plays out as outlined, Redwire could cement itself as a foundational piece of U.S. and allied space-defense infrastructure. Redwire is quietly building the bones of a multi-decade national asset, and with execution, it could someday be worth tens or even hundreds of billions.**

**I hold 36.2k Shares, and not planning to sell until it 10x**
ChatGPT post Post a screen shot of your holdings When it runs out of money in late 2026, what it management going to do? The company just sold 16mm shares at $16.75 for $258mm. This company has a $2B enterprise value and only $166mm in assets. Operating cash flow the last 12 months was -$65mm.

How can a space ""infrastructure"" company have almost no PPE? Unbilled revenue is one of the largest assets at $43mm. 

I don't think I have ever seen something like this before. Prompt: “Create a bullish investment thesis around the company Redwire, spelling out why it’s a strong investment in 2026 so I can unload my bags. Make sure to weave in hype from various hype-driven sectors” You better then convince your wife investing in BKSY rather than RKLB Redwire builds solar arrays for NASA’s Artemis Gateway, develops 3D printing in orbit (Archinaut), powers VLEO Earth observation satellites with AI payloads, and now delivers DoD Blue List of Approved Drones drones for defense use. The list goes on. These are highly specialized systems. But hey, if you thought this was a real estate company, I get why it all flew over your head; literally. But post screenshot of your holdings Even the way it’s formatted Did you get a DM with a screen matching matching there holding?

1mb4aqt,2025-07-28,"Robinhood stock HOOD symbol, not app
I bought way too many shares of Robinhood when it ipo’ed back in 2021

I was down like 70%/80% for years and now I’m up 200%

I put a substantial amount in…like probably about 8% of my total funds

Is now the time to sell some? 

Many tech stocks like NVDA, Google, Meta, Coinbase, and others have risen a lot over the last couple years

I am somewhat new to investing so I could use people on the internet’s advice please

If you had the value of all your Robinhood stock in cash, would you dump it all into that stock?

That’s your answer. Take out your original investment amount. That’s a great universal rule of thumb, can’t believe I never thought about it that way If you belive in the future game-ification of markets, then hold it. The more people trade and gamble, then the more money hood makes.

Edit: I don't know your personal situation, but 200% is pretty sweet. Consider taking some profit and diversifying. Sure if you've got something better in mind for the money, but why cut off the heads of your runners? Personally I believe Robinhood has more room to grow. Up to $250 billion market cap over the next few years, an extra 150% upside. Getting added into the S&P 500 index will help a lot but the committee is on whatever and haven’t done it yet (they’re probably loading up on it before they do that lol) What about the tax implications Holding strong, With 19 dollars average. I would never sell! One of the most innovative company that I know. 
ALSO, they haven't got in to S&P and nasdaq100 yet. So 150Billion MC is possible :) The only sane advice...  A simple yet very effective corollary.  It took me a long time but in my fifties I feel I do this. Trades aren’t made via homing pigeon. Costs are irrelevant. The stock gave you personally nothing at all nor does it owe you anything.  I sold something recently I liked because I liked the idea of META at around $700 more. Basically I move around large positions only where I see clear better performance and ride winners pretty far.

1mb1k9p,2025-07-28,"Thoughts on Ambiq Micro (AMBQ) debuting next week
Just heard that Ambiq Micro (AMBQ) is making their IPO next week. They seem like a really good company to invest in, making low-power SoC chips and Google & Samsung being their customers. Working on a deal with Mouser Electronics that could increase their customer base. They seem to possess SPOT (Sub-threshold Power Optimized Technology) tech in their chips, which makes them power efficient. Looks like they may thrive in the AI-race??

Problem seems to be their customer base in China got cut down heavily.

They also have shown increase in Revenue and cut down on losses steadily over the years.

Can someone provide insights if this is a good stock to invest in? Planning on investing in FIGMA ($3K) & can put in $1K no this if y'all say it's promising.
I’m planning on waiting till it drops to around $38.. looks like the China tariffs haven’t fully impacted it yet. Really feel it’ll dip that low.. we’ll see. What you think? Because I read that it’s really popular, users love it, it’s UX design tool which is super important for any company that has a website. Also looks like they’ve performed pretty well Awesome thank you. I put a limit order for 25$ but I wonder what it will open at Looks like it will open at 24. I hope. We will see. Hopefully some there is  good momentum like the other semis. :) ive had my eye on it; it hit 48 when it dumped open then sort of flattened to 40; now its coming up again in the aftermarket. looks like its doing a level around 42. probably means a good day tomorrow. im already in some other stuff for tomorrow but i might try to pick some up next week and see what else it does.

did you look at celestica/cls too this week? im thinking of trying that, & maybe if it comes down a little too, maybe next week. software plays should be pretty tariff proof so im starting to think about those. right now im doing rddt earnings. It opened at 40 it seems Welcome to r/stocks!

1marvt0,2025-07-27,"Aurora Innovations (AUR) - Current front runner in autonomous trucking software and hardware



https://aurora.tech/

Looking into AUR next. Autonomous trucking hardware/software company. Summary:

    •    Cash on hand: $1.15–1.2B

    •    Burn rate: $142M/Q or $600–700M/annually

    •    Runway: ~6–7 quarters (18–22 months), assuming no change

    •    To extend this runway, Aurora must either reduce burn, raise new funds, or both before cash reserves are exhausted.


Aurora Innovation has established strategic partnerships with several leading companies to advance the development and deployment of its self-driving technology, particularly for autonomous trucks. Key partnerships include those with Nvidia and Continental, focusing on both the software and hardware aspects of autonomous driving systems. Other significant collaborations involve companies like Uber Freight, FedEx, Hirschbach Motor Lines, PACCAR, Ryder, Schneider, and Volvo, reflecting a broad ecosystem approach to commercializing autonomous trucking. 


Aurora Innovation (AUR) was co-founded by Chris Urmson, the former chief technology officer of Google/Alphabet Inc.'s self-driving team, which became known as Waymo, as well as by Sterling Anderson, former head of Tesla Autopilot, and Drew Bagnell, former head of Uber's autonomy and perception team.

They are already doing test runs between Houston and Dallas, and just started a run between El Paso and Phoenix (a 1000 mile, 14 hour run that currently cannot legally be done by a single human driver in a day due to a max of 11 hours driving time allowed). This is part of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's (FMCSA) Hours of Service (HOS) regulations. The 11 hours of driving must be taken within a 14-consecutive-hour period, after at least 10 consecutive hours off duty. 

This is a huge advantage of autonomous trucks, they can operate 24 hours a day with no breaks legally required. 

So they have a huge runway right now for cash on hand compared to cash burn, they seem to be one of the leaders compared to Waymo (Waymo stopped doing trucking and focused solely on cab company)

A couple other speculative competitors but the closest is a privately owned company so can’t invest in it anyway. My guess is there is no winner take all for self driving and most likely a competition based future until one rockets to the front of the pack by being head and shoulders above the others…Which could be 5-10 years from now, but plenty of money to be made between now and then. Google and AUR are the best bets. 

Multi year hold for real gains, could still easily see a 100% gain in the next 0.5-2 years. Potential 10x by 2030.  

Aur at $11b market cap today, Waymo is like $45b right now. 
Most analysts have it valued at $10 a share. 
 
No debt and $1b cash on hand is really nice. 

Holding 3000 shares and $4000 worth of Jan 2026 $10 calls and $10-$15 2027 leaps.

This is on sale right now due to Uber (\~86 million shares, \~22–26% of Aurora) issued $1 billion of exchangeable senior notes (with an over-allotment option up to $150 million), due in 2028, right after AUR hit feature complete.

Personally I think the stock is momentarily depressed due to this, and see the price bouncing back already now that that shock is over. Uber still holds the shares but essentially sold a giant call option as backing for a massive loan.

Fundamentals are very good, the technology is safety driven and the domain is constrained (Well mapped, federal interstates, sunbelt, favorable regulatory climates, expensive best in class sensor suites attached to already expensive trucking rigs, a virtual software testing harness, and point to point deliveries between shipping hubs.) Their operations center is a scalable subscription service, While disrupting human drivers, insurance and unlocking 24/7 trucking has clear ROI. I see deep value here and bought a significant amount of LEAPs.

  
I cannot understand why so much of the focus here has been on L4 autonomy displacing cheap plentiful uber drivers with affordable insurance on some of the most complex city streets and parking lots in infinitely untestable surfaces, all to realize a 20$ cab fare + tip? 

Safe qualified truck drivers are perpetually in shortage, expensive, expensive to insure, and drive expensive equipment that sits idle due to driving hour maximums - while driving in a boring predictable tedious domain that machines excel at, especially as a fleet. ""Follow the speed limit exactly, maintain safe following distances, constantly check every blind spot"" all while disruptions to JIT delivery has outsized financial risk to business. I’m gonna steal this comment for the wsb post. Got any other articles or anything else to add for a bigger dd post? Where do you think more funding might come from? Likely dilutive, but not necessary at the moment with over $1b cash on hand. New partnerships could provide additional funding as well. do you have any analysis that backs this up? 20x seems high to me, but we will know within a couple of years for sure, once we see the growth rate If ya want to do that it's fine. I put what I wrote though the AI grinder to clean up what I wrote on my phone.



⸻

This stock is presently on sale due to a technical, non-fundamental dislocation: Uber (~86 million shares, ~22–26% of Aurora) issued $1 billion in exchangeable senior notes (with a $150 million over-allotment option), due in 2028, just after Aurora declared its autonomy stack “feature complete.” The market misread this financing structure—essentially Uber selling a large call option on its Aurora stake to collateralize a zero-coupon loan—as a bearish signal rather than a liquidity optimization. Uber still holds the equity and has not exited; the price drop reflects anticipatory dilution, not a deterioration in fundamentals. That shock appears absorbed, and the stock has begun to rebound.

Fundamentally, Aurora is a high-conviction industrial AI play. Its L4 autonomy system is built not for chaotic urban passenger rides but for a constrained, well-mapped, high-value domain: U.S. interstate freight corridors in favorable regulatory jurisdictions. This is where autonomy actually works—limited edge-case volatility, point-to-point logistics between shipping hubs, and standardized driving behaviors that reward rule-following machines. The sensor suite is expensive, but it’s deployed on already expensive semi rigs where marginal cost is amortized efficiently. Their virtual software harness accelerates validation, and their operations center provides a scalable, subscription-like service model—monetizing autonomy as infrastructure, not as gadgetry.

The economic thesis is equally strong. Unlike the labor-abundant urban ridehail sector—where the average driver is underpaid, overregulated, and insurable at low cost—the long-haul freight sector is short on safe, qualified drivers, who are expensive to employ, costly to insure, and legally capped in hours. Meanwhile, trucks costing $500k–$1M often sit idle. Autonomous freight eliminates these bottlenecks. Machines don’t fatigue. They follow the rules precisely—maintain distance, check blind spots, obey speed limits—and deliver continuous 24/7 uptime with compounding ROI. In logistics, where missed JIT windows can cripple a supply chain, this kind of reliability and throughput is not just preferable, it’s transformational.

That the AV sector has disproportionately focused on displacing immigrant cab drivers for $20 ride fares—via cut-rate sensors bolted to compact sedans navigating infinitely variable urban surfaces—is strategically baffling. Freight autonomy is not only more technically viable; it is economically inevitable. Aurora has the partnerships, the domain alignment, and the execution pathway to dominate this wedge. I’ve taken a significant LEAP position to reflect that belief.

⸻ No, it’s not the same thing, sister. Agreed. I have a few hundred shares but I'm debating whether to wait until the potential dilutive event to buy more. Aurora is a no brainer buy and hold. Easily a 20 bagger within 5 years. It’s different.

1ma7muc,2025-07-26,"I have a problem
Hello everyone,

I have been investing in the stock market for 5 years, I started at the beginning of 2021.

I was doing moderately well, but invested a big amount of my portfolio in a company that eventually went bankrupt. Since then, I’ve thankfully been more careful and not repeated the same mistake.

Here’s my issue, I’ll find a stock that seems to have a great investment thesis behind it (say GOOGL for example) but I’ll take a look at their chart and see that just 4 months ago, GOOGL was at $140s (now in the $190s) and as a result, I’ll immediately put it aside and wait for a pull back as it has already gone up 30% in 4 months, despite the fact that GOOGL’s is still almost flat since last year.

Likewise, when a company is at a complete all time low, I’ll say that it could always get worse and leave it! A good example - I saw EL back at the beginning of April, just after Michael Burry announced he sold off pretty much all his US equities and loaded up on EL. I saw the huge drop after their earnings and said “look at that, Burry bought but even still it isn’t the time to buy” - EL is up almost 90% since then. Even right now, EL is down 10% since last year, but I still won’t touch it because it’s already up 90% from its deep low.

I’m not sure if it’s just me that struggles with it, or if there are others here that do the same, but it feels like I keep missing out on large opportunities because I keep trying to time things tightly. I’m curious if anyone had any insight.

Thanks in advance.
You need to accept that you will miss out on many large opportunities. Last week particularly, I missed out on a massive amount of gain. But I accept this is a part of how it goes sometimes and move on. If you get upset about it then you will become emotional and act irrational. You need to be more objective about valuations and and stick to solid companies. If you feel like you cant fix this problem just stick to index funds. It helps to recognize the large losses that you miss out on by not acting. There’s lots of times I considered a stock and then later realized it would have been a terrible idea  Do you realize the vast majority of people picking stocks (even the professionals) fail to best the market over the long term? So invest index ETFs and get better results. If you enjoy picking stocks set aside a small part of your portfolio for that. Let’s think logically for a moment. A stock that you want to buy and hold for a long time, presumably, SHOULD be making all-time highs a lot. If it’s not, it means the stock isn’t growing.

The best time to buy a such a stock is yesterday. The next best time is today. Good stocks are like that, they are rarely discounted how you want it. Valuations seem to almost mean nothing these days. The market has been acting nonsensical since Covid. All signs point to recession but stocks keep climbing higher. Think of what other countries view the us markets as these days. Corrupt and manipulated. If a big crash does not happen in the next two years (a typical correction) there’s no denying we DO NOT HAVE A FREE AND FAIR MARKET. Price discovery is a lie and hedge funds keep letting prices rise on illicit and naked options activity. The main reason for them to do this is they need higher collateral to keep the bottom from falling out on their bad bets. Look at unrealized losses in the banking and prime broker category. Buffet went to high percentage of cash before retirement, the sahm indicator has been flashing. We have had an inverted yield curve all of 2025. None of it makes sense. A good play 5 years ago is a bad play now. A bad play now turns out to be a good one. I have lost all faith in the fed and our us markets and those that regulate (or so they say) them. It’s a giant ball of shit wrapped in dog shit and our pensions will suffer the largest brunt of it right along side retail investors. There is no regulation or punishment for those that made bad bets with other people’s money. We are their exit liquidity and just seem too stupid to realize it. Sorry for the doom and gloom but look it all up. We are one US interest  rate cut and one Japan rate hike away from closing the gap on the carry trade and the entire house of cards will fall. I’m sitting on 75 percent cash waiting for the crash of all crashes like buffet and I’ll buy cheap and make my gains in the next two decades. That is if the dollar survives. Good luck just my 2 cents This people.  90% of professional money managers cannot beat the S&P 500 over a 10yr period.  Kathy Woods can’t do it to save her life.  Don’t think you can, you likely can’t and there’s nothing wrong with that because you can buy a comprehensive etf or mf and beat most managers.  It’s not as sexy as hitting a runner like PLTR but the end game will still be good. Sometimes it helps to put it all out there, kind of bounce it off other people Don't invest in a stock based on the chart. Invest in a thesis. If no thesis is present, invest in indexes.

1ma7los,2025-07-26,"SPY bears will get a reprieve from the pain. But they'd be wise to jump on the bull side.
We currently have a market that is pricing in a goldilocks regime (inflation down, growth up). We have growth expectations historically low. Recession level low. That is not when corrections happen, so the market is correct in its growth pricing. Growth will slow but not to the level consensus believes it will. With regards to inflation, consensus already has rising inflation cooked into the books, so there will not be upside surprises on the inflation front. So upside surprises on the growth front alongside 0 surprises on the inflation front means a risk on environment. 

However, the number of asset classes and style factors pricing in goldilocks is approaching the 10 year trailing average. We cant price in growth up, inflation down forever. I believe the market is correct in pricing growth up. Upside surprises are to come on the growth front. But why are we pricing in inflation down? On a 1-3 month basis, the market is likely to price in a rise in inflation. Not just because of the qualitative reasoning (dollar down, tarriffs inflationary, growth up inflationary)  but mostly because of the quantitative reasoning explained above. 

We are likely headed into a reflationary regime. Stagflation is possible but not probable. Deflation is nearly impossible. Stopping fighting it. Don't swim upstream. Just buy pullbacks in SPY. 
Inflation is priced in, and that's why Walmart is trading at a PE of 50 I think we will see corrections soon, I have been buying some long puts as hedges whenever the market is up eg on earnings day I think the real surprise for you and many others will be stagflation. Have fun and make gains now and we'll deal with the rest later Feels like you have your own political bias when you say this Nobody does great in stagflation Valuations are getting absurd again though. I'm wary of another july 22-august 5 type of event when the first half year's growth was so priced in that none of the mags could match the expensive valuations they grew into at the Q2 earnings. MSFT tanked, Nvidia tanked (shocking everyone that was big on the AI hype train) and we started getting all those 'Is all this capex warranted"" jitters around AI that made so many people scream ""BUBBLE""

Not to mention Deepseek. 

When a disruptive piece of news hits, the market can tank, and it can tank HARD if it's all priced for perfection. That's the problem when you price in a smooth winds ahead scenario. Any kind of news that breaks apart the optimism of a hefty bull run can result in a correction. 

I personally think we'll correct before we push any more upwards. yeah unfortunately for us (I'm not even from the US) we have to pay attention to Donnie's endless ramblings if we are to successfully navigate the markets during his term. He's unrelentingly vocal, it makes the game harder than it needs to be imo. retail has been buying the entire rally and the short term bull trade was based around bitcoin and mag 7 capex. those two things caused the ATH. now we are entering earnings season where we will see there isn't much substance to the rally, but it may still take a few weeks for that to materialize. QQQ likely to lead a nice squeeze as shorts try to time the top and then the profit taking will hit hard Close then NOW and don't do that again.

1ma6h5j,2025-07-26,"Stocks which will benefit the most if Trump’s Tariff actions are ruled to be illegal…
The US Court of Appeals will hear oral arguments regarding the legality of Trump’s tariff actions on July 31, 2025. A decision within weeks is expected thereafter, and likely further appeal to the US Supreme Court. If the Court upholds Trump’s actions, it seems to be a status quo event. But if it is ruled that the President does NOT legally have such authority, the impact might be very significant for many companies.   
In that event, which stocks would you expect to benefit the most?   
I own AAPL and assume that it would react positively. Which others would you be looking for to rise strongly on such news (if it happens.) ?
I wouldn’t hold my breath waiting for Trump to be held accountable. I doubt the SC will go against Trump, but if they did say the tariffs were not legal you could see GM pop, they just reported Q2 numbers that showed over $1B hit to operating income directly because of tariffs Even more relevant, the court of appeals decision isn't likely to change anything in the near term and SCOTUS won't start hearing arguments until October.  They won't issue a ruling until next year.

Nothing is changing soon. The U.S. dollar lol Limpdick’s investment firm Cantor is buying tariff debt from small and medium sized businesses with the understanding they will be ruled illegal. pretty fucking telling of what he thinks will happen at least. Nike. If they are ruled to be illegal, I think the entire market will rally lol The businesses will be owed that money back from the government. So he is buying it at a discount  such that he gets the spread.  💯

Fuck that guy and may every door hit him on the ass on the way out, but anyone thinking he won’t avoid every single bad thing he should suffer is just deluding themselves. He made a deal with the devil and we all have to pay the bill. Yes exactly, they are giving small and medium sized businesses loans to cover a certain percentage of the tariffs paid (since most literally can not afford to pay them in totality without going under).

Wthout a Trump presidency we almost certainly would have had no tariff onslaught and lower interest rates by now. This is amazing: one by one, Trump is securing a tax cut for foreigners while imposing a tax hike on Americans and calling it a win! Bullish my ex-US ETFs which are up bigly this year. Literally everything else he does Brace yourselves.  Video evidence on X that Trump cheats at golf.

And he is normally a man of such high character. i mean, you gotta think about the long term consequences, and things like political stability.

all of these are quite important and not extremist at all. I don't understand bears.  We are literally printing money, and they just want to whine about how unfair it is that the market just goes up.

If you can't even find the will to buy shares or leaps, then you should just take your cash and buy CDs or a savings account. part of it is people mixing politics and investing. I dislike the party in power and want them to fail, but I'd be a fool to bet against US corporations doing well in this environment. Dollar surge on the back of EU bending over for the US.

Trump won. Printing money is theoretically bad, that's why people like Ray Dalio keep making noise about it. 

The economy is different from the stock market. At some point the market will crash again, but I think bears generally have the timing wrong.

1m9kcri,2025-07-26,"What are we investing in during these crazy times?
So in April when stock prices were down, I scraped up all the cash I could and added more of what currently hold. Since I’ve been just saving up to have some cash on hand and now I’m ready to put more money in the market but like everyone I’m concerned the bubble will burst soon but don’t want to sit and wait so I am curious what is everyone buying during these crazy times? I just added some more WM this week and some GOOGL a couple weeks ago. Thanks

EDIT. A few people tell me to DCA or VOO and chill. I get it but in just not here for that. I’ve invested in real estate for 20 years and 3-4 years ago got into stocks to diversify and because it’s interesting. I’m enjoying the conversation and interesting suggestions here. I’ll be reading and learning about your suggestions. Thank you. 
Just DCA till the end of eternity Space and AI. Full port AMD Yes, it will definitely go up or down I think ASML is the biggest steal in the market right now DCA into an index fund and move on with your life. I might not be one of the lucky people with individual stocks going insane sometimes, but I still make enough to ensure I can retire comfortably. And energy, staples and commodities. I feel like people think Trump is waffling, until a day comes that he actually doesn't. Most investors are extremely greedy at the moment, too greedy for the current world-economic situation.

Well, personally I rotated some of my profits to the less volatile part of my portfolio (consumer staples, finance, telecom), keep DCA'ing and got a big pile of cash ready for the next big correction to put into my more, currently overpriced innovative part of my portfolio. Any reaction after Aug 1st or is that already priced in? Start by telling everyone you have $5M on Reddit, even though nobody asked, and it isn't related to the question posed, then make sure to specify that it's in USD, again even though nobody asked for that detail.

1mvf951,2025-08-20,"Hertz stock jumps 9% premarket as it partners with Amazon to sell used cars in 4 US cities, with nationwide expansion planned
No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hertz-stock-jumps-on-deal-to-sell-its-used-cars-on-amazon-130816260.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hertz-stock-jumps-on-deal-to-sell-its-used-cars-on-amazon-130816260.html)

Rental car firm Hertz (HTZ) struck a deal with Amazon Autos (AMZN) on Wednesday to sell some of its used car inventory. The company said this will make it easier for customers to purchase cars from its fleet.

Starting today, customers can search Amazon Autos to browse, finance, and purchase from thousands of used Hertz fleet vehicles from brands like Ford, Toyota, Chevrolet, Nissan, and others. Hertz Car Sales, the rental car firm's used car sales arm, will be the first fleet dealer on Amazon Autos.

""Our goal is to reimagine the car-buying experience and meet customers where they are — whether online or in person — with convenience, confidence and scale,"" Hertz Car Sales executive vice president Jeff Adams said in a statement. ""Amazon Autos is the ideal partner to help us deliver on this as customers can shop our expansive inventory of high-quality used cars on the same trusted marketplace where millions shop every day.""

Hertz said sales will begin in the Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, and Seattle metro areas, with plans to expand to Hertz Car Sales' 45 locations nationwide. After customers complete their purchase online, they can pick up the vehicles at Hertz locations in those cities.

""This collaboration allows us to offer an expanded selection of well-maintained vehicles from more dealerships across the country, while maintaining the simplicity that customers expect from Amazon,” Global Head of Amazon Autos Fan Jin said in a statement.

Hertz will offer a 115-point inspection process and a 12-month/12,000-mile powertrain warranty. Hertz is also adding a seven-day/250-mile buyback guarantee and 24-hour roadside assistance.

Amazon's addition of Hertz vehicles is another big move for its auto sales business. Late in 2024, Amazon struck a deal with Hyundai (005380.KS) to sell new vehicles in cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, among others. Amazon users can buy and finance vehicles from local participating dealers directly on Amazon's website or app.

As for Hertz, the company is coming off something of a PR hit after its newly implemented AI scanning tool for returned vehicles dinged renters with high fees, sometimes thousands of dollars, for damage that renters claim they did not incur.
I’d love to buy a used car that’s been vomited in Buying a used rental car sight unseen, what could go wrong? I guarantee they will make a buyback as hard as possible. And reeks of air freshener trying in vain to cover up tobacco smell As someone who bought a used fleet vehicle from Hertz years ago, you can get a decent discount on the front-end, but you will never be able to sell it for anywhere near what a comparable vehicle would get if it wasn’t a former rental car. I’m running the thing into the ground because even with the insane used car market, I’m basically getting offered just above scrap value Does that 115 point inspection include confirming that the car hasn’t been reported to police for Unauthorized Use or Grand Theft? Not interested in buying a car sight unseen that’s been used as a soup kitchen by Dirty Mike and the Boys.

1muognc,2025-08-19,"Trump Quietly Expands Section 232 Steel & Aluminum Derivatives - 50%
Our brokers just hit us with this news today. This now includes any steel, cast iron or aluminum in a product.

You need to declare the country of melt/cast. The weight of the steel/aluminum in the product and the dollar value of the steel/aluminum.

This now includes nails, tacks, corners, angles, brackets, pulleys, stamped parts, rails etc… If your product has any of these metals in it you now need to dig in and figure out how much because it will be taxed.

Let’s say you have a widget from China with 75% steel it’s now taxed at 50% + original Section 301 tariffs (25%) The IEEPA Reciprocal tariffs are exempt on the 75% but your remaining non-steel products is tariffed at IEEPA and any old section 301 tariffs. 

This is an absolute mess to keep track of and adds more tariff on to just about every product.

Definitely sounds legit and not made up.

So where can I buy your course/signals/mentorship/etc.? Putting aside compounding, and assuming he just makes 160k an hour, then

160k/hour \* 6.5 hours a trading day \* 251 trading days a year = $261Million a year. Even if you did that for a 100 years, that's only $26 billion.

Really puts into perspective how ludicrously rich some people are 💀

Of course, with compounding, that number gets big fast, but you'll run into liquidity problems eventually. The fuck, why can't you just do this everyday and be the richest person in the world?

1mtrv58,2025-08-18,"$Wulf - time to talk about value/gamma play 3M+ invested.
Hi fellow regards. Infrequent but long time poster here. Posted about RKT and the one who cannot be named gamma ramp in 2021.  Today I want to tell you about the value play in WULF  and potential gamma ramp. No garbage AI needed. 

Everyone knows Nvidia and AI, and the big players meta Google OpenAI. There is a computing shortage for these AI companies and data centre companies who provide high power computing (hpc) and picking up hype.  One such player, among 5 others, is terawulf which is situated near New York.  They had a 1 billion usd contract with core42 but as of today this has expanded to over 7 billion after fluidstack/google deal (with a market cap stock of 3.9 billion)

Key factors:
The value bit. 
1- 7.7 billion in revenue in 10 years
2- no chance of default with Google backstopping 3.2 billion for 14% of the company, effectively evaluating it at 22.8 billion (6x current price)
3- No real share dilution in the last year (except above but Google won’t sell). No insider sells. 
4- still has more MW room to grow. 

The gamma ramp bit. 
3- 64% institutional ownership
4- 32% SI, 36% SV ratio
5- Recent catalyst with hyperscaler Google contract (++ exposure)

Where I think it’ll grow? $20 by December but local higher in the interim by gamma ramp potential. 

Good luck regards. Posting one of my brokerage positions. 
I got this stock before the Google stuff helped it take off because I could see they have a LOT of potential income sources if they use all of their infrastructure correctly. I'm glad I did. It's been one of my top performers recently. I'll be holding this one for the foreseeable future. Does WULF still have room for growth after $10? I saw the weekly, monthly climb, and I'm so pissed I missed out on this company. Still sitting around with my large stack.  However, last week there was only $1 billion in 10 year revenue.  In the last week guarenteed revenue increased by 7x, hyperscaler signed, and marketcap increase by just shy of 1x $wulf along with $iren $cifr $apld can be a good Quadfecta on AI infra/data centre play, me thinks. Where were you last week!?? The big players don’t want the risk of owning large datacenters that become useless if their AI plays don’t materialize profits, so they outsource the risk to small players. Seems promising. Why doesn't Google buy the company to acquire the tech behind it and run the operations themselves instead of increasing its stake ? Really bullish on their offering announcement today too because they are doing it in a way that limits current investor dilution. That gives me confidence that they actually want to do some rapid growth and expansion to increase profitability and shareholder value. I like the company so far. Yeah they say and deliver.

1mtpdl8,2025-08-18,"Warren Buffett places fresh wager on the housing market - COOP/RKT play
[https://www.resiclubanalytics.com/p/housing-market-warren-buffett-buys-dr-horton-lennar-homebuilder-stocks](https://www.resiclubanalytics.com/p/housing-market-warren-buffett-buys-dr-horton-lennar-homebuilder-stocks)

Details are paywalled, but the basics are that, besides the ""bet"" that Buffet placed on UNH that we're all seeing here on WSB, he \*also\* bought into the anticipated improvement in interest rates and the housing market, buying into two of the biggest homebuilders, Lennar and Dr Horton.

I've placed a $1M ""bet"" that Buffet is correct, and that interest rates and housing are going to improve in '26 and '27, with COOP and RKT. RKT, the #1 mortgage originator in the US, has already bought Redfin (RDFN) and is in the process of finalizing the acquisition (announced earlier this year) of COOP, the #1 mortgage servicer in the US.

COOP shareholders are voting to approve the acquisition early Sept, and it's expected to be finalized in early-mid Q4.

Following a great Q2 earnings call, RKT almost hit $20, and COOP briefly hit $200, climbing 25% each in a couple of weeks. Both have pulled back about 10% off their highs on profit taking (and some uneasiness about the PPI number that came out last week), but the float for both is extremely tight and any demand pushes up prices almost immediately.

WHEN a) the acquisition is finalized in Q4, BEFORE any Rate Cuts, their '26 earnings are anticipated to drive RKT pricing into the mid-20's, based on $2.5B in projected earnings ALONE, and b) the Fed cuts rates, as happened last year around the same time, expect RKT pricing to surge 25-40% depending on the number of rate cuts and their timing (check the charts for what happened, last time the Fed cut rates). 

PS, COOP shareholders get 11 RKT per COOP (plus $2) per COOP share, and at current pricing, COOPs trading at a 6-7% discount to RKT (reflecting the ""uncertainty"", what little there is, that the acquisition hasn't been officially approved yet).

Want to join Buffet in playing the housing market and rate cuts? COOP and RKT are excellent ways to do so...
this factually has nothing to do with buffett Not you again. Every week I see this guy try to post some DD about RKT trying to pump it up. Just give it a rest already. Your headline literally makes it sound like he bought RKT/COOP. Why you getting all upset for people calling you out over the stupid ass headline **YOU** made? You may have “$1M in this play” but you’re obviously a fucking moron. Trying to jump down our throats over a misleading post you made is 🤡 behavior Oh I remember you, you are the guy I got into an argument with about over RKTs balance sheet and who couldn’t tell the difference between EBITDA and net income. Why are you still here? No one wants to pump your bags. Buffet’s bets tend to have less to do with perceived growth opportunities and more to do with perceived undervaluation. This is really more Buffet saying he think home builder stocks are currently undervalued, not that he necessarily expects home building to skyrocket. It’s an important distinction. You think this zombie turd economy will make it that long? I dunno how much more it can lumber along Everything you just said compels me to buy calls Where did you get your crystal ball? I can’t find one anywhere. Buffett betting big on housing again could be a mssive signal, COOP and RKT could be the ultimate sleeper plays before rate cuts hit.

1mtn23c,2025-08-18,"GoodRx jumps 34% after deal to sell Novo Nordisk’s GLP-1 drugs at $499/month as demand for weight-loss meds surges
No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goodrx-stock-soars-after-striking-deal-to-sell-novo-nordisks-glp-1s-for-499month-130021070.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goodrx-stock-soars-after-striking-deal-to-sell-novo-nordisks-glp-1s-for-499month-130021070.html)

GoodRx (GDRX) is joining in on the GLP-1 action with an announcement on Monday that it will begin selling both of Novo Nordisk's (NVO) GLP-1 drugs, Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss, at a cash price of $499 per month.

The partnership comes as telehealth and digital health platforms are increasingly viewed as ways to provide greater access to the in-demand products.

GoodRx CEO Wendy Barnes told Yahoo Finance that while the company isn't first out of the gate with the strategy, it believes it's coming in at the right time.

""There's no question we could have tried to do something sooner from a compounded alternative pathway, but we have been very clear in our belief that it needed to be FDA-approved, lawfully approved. It just wasn't a pathway that we were going to support,"" Barnes said.

The announcement sent GoodRx's stock soaring, up about 20% in early trading Monday.

Telehealth platforms like Hims & Hers (HIMS) have recently been under pressure after Novo ended a relationship with them, when Hims refused to stop selling compounded, or copycat versions, of the GLP-1s.

Compounded versions of the popular drugs have been on the market for several years, and were originally allowed by the FDA when Novo Nordisk and competitor Eli Lilly (LLY) were unable to meet the demand of the market for their GLP-1s. With the shortages declared over, the copycats are now illegal, but compounding pharmacies and their sellers claim to be lawfully selling them through a loophole in the law, known as personalized medicine. If a patient is unable to tolerate the side effects of a drug, a compounded version is often used.

""There are very good reasons to use compounded medications, which are clinically appropriate and acceptable. That is not where things sit right in this class of drugs,"" Barnes said.

The sales of the injectables through GoodRx also vary from Eli Lilly's strategy, which has been selling vials of its products on telehealth platforms to reach more patients faster. Vials are easier to produce than the injectable pens, which were a key reason behind the shortage in the past two years.

GoodRx said it has seen surging demand for the GLP-1 products, with 17 million inquiries on its site for the drugs in the past year. That's up 22% from the year prior. The sale of Ozempic through GoodRx marks the first time the diabetes drug is being sold at a cash price, GoodRx said.

GoodRx also sells Eli Lilly's drugs, Mounjaro (for diabetes) and Zepbound, through its regular pharmacy channels at regular prices.

The announcement comes at a time when Novo Nordisk's weight-loss drug Wegovy is losing market share to Eli Lilly's Zepbound. The latest data, ending Aug. 8, shows weekly prescriptions for Zepbound up 199% year over year, compared to Wegovy's 40% increase, according to IQVIA, an analytics firm that tracks prescriptions in the US.

To address its market share decline, Novo Nordisk has announced several strategies that include digital health. It also partnered with CVS (CVS) to be the preferred GLP-1 drug on CVS Caremark's formulary.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has demanded that drug companies use more direct-to-consumer avenues to sell products at cheaper cash prices to patients.
Compounded drugs are still being sold as this stuff is being litigated. Only the smaller pharmacies stopped selling. I might add that a compounded GLP1 goes for around $150 a month now. GoodRx is a public company? > ""retardrutude""

That shit was made for us. No sane person is paying $500 a month for ozempic Calls on people being lazy and fat is the play 500/month when all you need to do is eat less???

Jesus. the research peptide route has been steadily gaining steam. ive got 2 years worth of tirzepatide sitting in my freezer that cost me about 1k and the price has only gone down since. i pretty much have to give it away to friends and family at this point as i've moved on to eli lilly's latest glp1 ""retatrutude"" which is better than the everything. There are two year supplies of compounded GLP1s for less than $400 on the grey market.

1msjbbm,2025-08-17,"UPS TO $100 ?
I really think we are at a great spot for a turn around point for UPS. The company just bounced off of its pre-2020 low- marking it a possible strong resistance point. Once we get through to 92, there shouldnt be any real resistance points up until $103.   
Here are some other reasons why i bought almost $5000 worth of different UPS options, 

1. UPS has joined the exclusive ""7% dividend yield club"" among S&P 500 companies, offering an annual yield around **7.3%**. I believe that there will be more cash flow into the company than people pulling out after the dividend yield. 

2. Corporate insiders Director William R. Johnson purchased 5,000 shares at \~$86.50, while CEO Carol Tomé bought 11,682 shares at \~$85.67. at the current dip. 

3. UPS is enhancing its healthcare logistics capabilities with a **$1.6 billion acquisition** of Canada's Andlauer Healthcare Group. This deal, expected to close in H2 2025

4. UPS is cutting **20,000 jobs** and closing **73 facilities** by mid-2025, targeting $3.5 billion in annual savings. Additionally, UPS is reducing its low-margin Amazon business by 50% by mid-2026, pivoting toward more profitable segments like healthcare logistics and SMB services.

5. Analysts at Bank of America view an end to the three-year “freight recession” in 2025. They anticipate that UPS—through dynamic pricing and rate increases—could benefit from improving freight demand, potentially lifting margins and boosting profitability.

6. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene disclosed a purchase between $1,001–$15,000 in UPS stock on August 4 (which isnt a alot but just having a rep buy something is a positive sign rather than negative )

Reduced fuel cost bc they're broken down, calls. Long term I like UPS and their turn around story, but a few things about your points - 
1. Entering the 7%+ dividend club because your stock jumped off a cliff isn’t exactly the way you want to become a member and much more likely signals a dividend cut in the near future
2. Tomé makes something like 20m a year - really not gonna get too excited when she adds 1m in shares - she is probably worth 100m+ 
3. This is definitely a interesting bet/pivot in focus that I think makes sense
4. Love the cost cutting and think it’ll definitely improve margins, but don’t expect to see that reflected until h2 2026 in the balance sheet 
5.  The freight business is rough - Dara from Uber has been talking about how everything will be magic when business picks back up since 2023
6. Definitely not taking any advice from MTG, especially financial related https://preview.redd.it/se8pm4zv8mjf1.png?width=1165&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2bdf79cecbcb8717d018f541844f88f3f3db198

1msggfm,2025-08-17,"I’m ready to share my loss porn, story below.

For the last several years of investing, I was always a pretty reasonable investor. I followed trends and memes to a small degree, but mostly invested in relatively safe things and was pretty well diversified. This is reflected in my growth from August up until around December.

In December, I started doing dumb shit like going full port in random stocks. And for a while, it was a quick in and out and it obviously was working quite well for me. Did this on stocks like archer, rocket labs, d wave, qubt, and a couple others riding the hype. Then, I found a battery/btc stock, before it seemed to be popular or have much attention, but I felt like it would soon catch on. 

I was able to profit about $110k off the hype, which is how I got to the peak of 726k. However, my next play went terribly wrong.

Around this time, I unfortunately found the pennystock sub — worst thing that could have ever happened to me (so far). Due to my gains on things like archer and others, I gained a small following and several connections. 

Someone reached out to me about a pennystock that seemed to moon often around December. I did a lot of research, I became a mod for the sub, and I truly believed in the company and everything I saw. Given the small market cap I can’t discuss it, but it’s an AI company associated with train safety. 

Unfortunately, I was either extremely wrong or just way too early. Said stock is down 82%, year a date, and quite linearly at that. Due to my research and conviction, and possibly a component of groupthink and being in an echo chamber…. I kept holding and holding, as I began to lose tens of thousands of dollars on a weekly and sometimes daily basis. I was convinced that things would turn around the next week… the next week… the next week. Sadly, the *next* week never came. 

As you can see, I slowly, but quickly, dropped from a high of about $726k to $135k in a span of about 3 months. And yes, I’m just a normal person, so this was devastating for me just like it would be devastating for most people here. It was very hard to cope with and accept at times. But of course, I accept full responsibility for what I did… like a true regard, I made extremely risky and greedy bets, and it worked — until it didn’t. 

Needless to say, I learnt my lesson and these days I never go full port into a single stock anymore, and I sure don’t touch speculative or pennystocks with extremely small market caps anymore where just my personal buying or selling can swing the stock. I’ve made progress on the way back, but still barely half way back to where I was. 

Btw for privacy reasons, I had to change my account to private, so that’s why you won’t see any of my history if you look it up. 

Yes, it takes a true regard to lose $600k in 3 months on a train pennystock. Hope it was a fun read and you guys can learn from my mistakes! 
Respect for being honest with yourself But now you're at 430k ? That's a pretty good recovery Missing a huge part of story here. 135 to 430???? Ya this doesn't happen without some degen stuff. Ladies and gentleman, this is how you become a bag holder and end up behind wendys.

1msanvd,2025-08-16,"Sam Altman says ‘yes,’ AI is in a bubble
As economists [speculate](https://fortune.com/2025/07/17/ai-bubble-vs-dot-com-stocks-apollo-economist-torsten-slok/) whether the stock market is in an AI bubble that could soon burst, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has just admitted to believing we’re in one. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI?” Altman said during [a lengthy interview with *The Verge* and other reporters last night](https://www.theverge.com/command-line-newsletter/759897/sam-altman-chatgpt-openai-social-media-google-chrome-interview). “My opinion is yes.”

In the far-ranging interview, Altman compared the market’s reaction to AI to the dot-com bubble in the ’90s, when the value of internet startups soared before crashing down in 2000. “When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,” Altman said. “If you look at most of the bubbles in history, like the tech bubble, there was a real thing. Tech was really important. The internet was a really big deal. People got overexcited.”

He added that he thinks it’s “insane” that some AI startups with “three people and an idea” are receiving funding at such high valuations. “That’s not rational behavior,” Altman said. “Someone’s gonna get burned there, I think.” Over the past year, we’ve seen several AI startups, including [Safe Superintelligence](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/12/openai-co-founder-ilya-sutskevers-safe-superintelligence-reportedly-valued-at-32b/), led by OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, [and Thinking Machines](https://www.reuters.com/technology/mira-muratis-ai-startup-thinking-machines-raises-2-billion-a16z-led-round-2025-07-15/), founded by ex-OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati, [raise billions of dollars](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/10/ai-artificial-intelligence-billionaires-wealth.html).

“Someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money. We don’t know who, and a lot of people are going to make a phenomenal amount of money,” Altman said. “My personal belief, although I may turn out to be wrong, is that, on the whole, this would be a huge net win for the economy.”

Even if we may be in an AI bubble, it seems Altman is expecting OpenAI to survive the burst. “You should expect OpenAI to spend trillions of dollars on data center construction in the not very distant future,” Altman said. “You should expect a bunch of economists to wring their hands.”

I hate him but he is right, so the best course of action is nvda calls. No shit. These AI companies are replicating Google search at 100 to 1000x the cost.

Google is replicating the Google search... but now I'm paying for it. Fuck it, we ball. Not rocket science IMO. This thing is happening. There will be winners and losers. Just like there always is.

(Bloomberg) -- Applied Materials Inc. suffered the worst single-day stock decline in five years after giving a disappointing sales and profit forecast, renewing concerns that the US trade dispute with China is weighing on demand.

Revenue will be approximately $6.7 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, the company said in a statement Thursday. Analysts had estimated $7.32 billion on average. Profit will be about $2.11 a share, excluding some items, compared with a projection of $2.38.

Applied Materials, the largest American producer of chipmaking gear, is seeing less demand from customers in China, Chief Executive Officer Gary Dickerson said in an interview. It also faces delays in approval for exporting technology to that country, he said. Moreover, large customers are putting off some purchases in the face of prolonged negotiations around tariffs and other economic issues.

“It just creates a level of uncertainty,” Dickerson said.

The outlook sent shares of Applied Materials down 14% on Friday, the most since the early days of the pandemic in March 2020. They had been up 16% this year heading into the report.

In the third quarter, which ended July 27, revenue rose 7.7% to $7.3 billion. Analysts had anticipated $7.21 billion on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit was $2.48 a share, compared with an estimate of $2.36.

Applied Materials’ customer ranks include some of the biggest names in the chip industry, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Samsung Electronics Co. and Intel Corp. Those manufacturers order gear well ahead of starting production, making Applied Materials’ forecasts a barometer for future demand.

The company said last week that it would participate in an Apple Inc. plan to boost manufacturing in the US by spending more than $200 million on a facility in Arizona. Applied Materials will also sell equipment to Texas Instruments Inc.’s US factories to support Apple products.

“Applied Materials’ decision to be a core member of Apple’s ‘American Manufacturing Program,’ a drive to increase factory production within the US, could strengthen its position as a key supplier of chipmaking tools for advanced semiconductors used in iPhones,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Masahiro Wakasugi said in a note.

“The new administration is very focused on increasing semiconductor supply in the United States,” Dickerson said on Thursday. “We’re very positive.”

In July, rival Lam Research Corp. said revenue for the quarter ending in December would ease from the current-quarter levels, with Chinese customers potentially scaling back after a spending spree.

In a further sign of US-China tensions, Applied Materials was recently sued by Beijing E-Town Semiconductor Technology Co. over what that company characterized as trade secret theft.

Still, Dickerson said the long-term demand outlook for computing power remains strong. Customers in China had significantly ramped up buying in recent years, and are now just digesting those purchases, he said.
My calls just got obliterated. Thanks, AMAT. Probably a good time to load on stock because once these stupid tariffs are lifted and we go back to normal, these companies will rocket up My puts printed. I love it 😍 This is the correct answer. Regards learn nothing from NVDA, GOOGL, Apple, UNH drops. Semicaps (including ASML) can’t be bought right now until we see how Intel and Samsung plan CapEx for 2026 and beyond.

These are all tremendous companies but when two of your three largest customers aren’t finalized on spending plans there will be pain. What does tariffs have to do with UNH? I think they meant to say, “line only go up”. Oof, imagine holding through that. Hope y’all had puts.

1mrftjr,2025-08-16,"$UNH - Warren Bailed me out.
Was planning on eventually posting the loss if it continued to go to zero. But thanks to Mr. Buffet, I was able to escape with a profit. No DD just emotions and gut feelings, buying the dip and getting in over my head with options. 

Played shares and slowly bought more options as it dipped trying to ""average down"" for a bounce so i could get out. FINAL positions shown and my daily balance over the last month shown as well. 

Right after earnings as as it began dipping I decided to say YOLO and move the rest of my shares into options expecting a bounce. It did not bounce.....until today 🙂
You were at 53 to start, god gave you a second chance, id deleverage atleast half my portflio if I were you. I like this UNH post so much more then that loser who spent 3 million on shares and showed us a 10% gain thinking we’d find it cool.

1mrf35m,2025-08-16,"UNH, with more than just a screenshot
So, I’ve been keeping an eye on UNH since Mr ceo got shot dead. It was just a matter of time before it rebounded, let’s be real, this giant isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. 

I really wanted to enter when the monthly RSI bounced off of 30 at the end of July, but missed an opportunity. Or so I thought. The weekly RSI started rebounding at the beginning of August, along with the daily, and as soon as it crossed over 30 - time to go. 

Started a small position on Aug 5th, 11:25 am (est) - 
The stock popped right at open, for no real reason, other than some buy reiterations from hedge funds and a few articles from SA and the fool. So I watched for a bullish crossover on the 15 minute macd for a point of entry. Bought 290c for 8/15 at .34- 290 being the last gap on the daily. 8/15 because 13Fs were due. 

UNH continued above $250, $255.49 to be exact and retraced from there back to 239.50. Fib retracement here. It opened at the 38.2 fib and held on 8/8, so I scaled in a little more at open. 10 0 DTE 250s for .22, sold 5 at .50, 1 at 1.04, and 4 at 1.08. 

Still holding the 290 at this point, probably down, who knows. 

on 8/11 and opened a 300c 8/22 position at .32. $250 had held through open, still playing the 290 gap/volatility. No idea about buffet at the point. Just had some left over from an intel play that turned out to fuel this. 

Bought intel on 8/11 and sold for 100%+ on 8/13. 

8/14 bought UNH 8/29 300c 5 at 1.36 and a 285c for today at .33 after it hit my 269.xx entry. It hit the 78.6 fib level in AH on 8/13, so my thought was to buy at the next level down if given the opportunity. 

Cue the 13Fs

Exited the 285c and 295c expiring today fairly early on to secure profits. Sold the 285c for 20.00 and the 290 for 15.00. Put limits in before open and left it so I wasn’t going insane. 

Wanted to exit the 300s today, but chose not to, as it has essentially established 305 as a new support level. 

Target exit is 325, right below the gap of 328. 


Currently up 2884% on 8/22 300c and 789% on the 8/29 300cs

Total gain today was $9,500 on a sub $1,000 option strat. 



Why are you narrating this post like it’s an episode of 24 Because my last post was “low effort” Nice TA
Thanks Well deserved, you did the homework I understand maybe 5% of all of that.  COuld you humor me with one question?  and jsut a yes or no will do:

you said .......  Bought 290c for 8/15 at .34   then later you said....   Sold the 285c for 20.00 and the 290 for 15.00.

  
super simple version of that....  you spent $34 and made $1500 from that snippet about he 290c I posted? That is correct Is INTC still on your radar? What’s the next play sensei Nice plays & appreciate the TA … I’m sitting with UNH leaps and shares for the long swing. Sold some 300 C this AM as well 👌 So happy the 13f tailwinds lined up.
Next on My radar for big near term pops … might suggest Cannabis sector … MSOS has been holding bullish after trumps “rescheduling” acknowledgment in “a few weeks” giving a decent short Call window … a lotto ticket on Cannabis is looking like a huge possibility. Im still watching it. I have zero positions on it currently. I’m waiting for a better entry on the retracement down. Key levels I’m watching are 25.50 25 24.50 and then fib levels of 23.82, 22.65, and 21.47. Also waiting to see what the daily RSI wants to do - currently at 69. If it crosses 70, could be a good opportunity to jump into calls. I wouldn’t play anything over a 25 strike, as every attempt to get over 25 has been swiftly shot down (see 2/18/25, went up to 27, volume dried up and went back to 17) 

TLDR, calls at fib levels or if the RSI crosses and holds above 70 with volume. Otherwise I’m just watching

1mr7ti6,2025-08-15,"F’ed Up Badly - Learn from my mistakes
This has been a sequence of mistakes mostly last year with random wrong earnings plays… I just want to share with you all as it was sad and disheartening as it was hard earned money.

I have been lucky to work in two jobs and already put back $35K back from this loss, it will take me two years to do so and I am already turning 50 years old next year.

I know that there are plenty of opportunities out there such as UNH, Intel or the Solar stocks today, but it just seems not to be for me…

I will keep grinding it pay check by pay check and trying to gradually forget it…. Too many wrong positions to tell some wrong revenge trades.. all sorts of things that you guys can imagine…. After the big loss of $85K I tried to come back with $10K in the 2024 Q4 went all in on Tech earnings (Meta, Amazon, Apple) but was not the right timing ….

I wish you all make tendies and find the hidden 10 baggers but please be careful to not incur in such big losses like I did. The sensation of lost time is very painful to manage. 

I will keep grinding - No $Rope for me, life is too beautiful to give up.

**MKT Cap:** $681M

**Type:** AI chip company based in Austin TX

Context: I work at a FAANG cloud provider that deals w/ these guys. It's the only reason I heard about them. Please do not take that as an insider guaranteed home run because if it was I would have gone heavier and not posted here. 

Theme #1: power bottleneck

I sit next to a data center OG who keeps telling me power is their big bottleneck. There's not enough power to heat and cool these racks due to AI demand.

Theme #2: wearables

I want AI wearables so I’m not always pulling out my phone when I need to ask it about something I'm looking at. Problem is battery drain. You need to run the models locally so they aren't dependent upon the internet at all times (i.e., locally = on the device itself). But AI is a battery life destroyer because the current chips can't do it well. Today most AI features on wearables are just cloud calls. It's slow, requires constant connectivity, and murders your battery.

Ambiq solves this combined problem with ultra-low-power chips built on sub-threshold voltage tech. These are already shipping in devices (a big requirement for me). I was worried this could be copied easily, but they've built a sticky moat to go along with it. They provide own AI runtime/compiler (Helios) optimized for their chips. Once a manufacturer integrates with it, its hard to swap. Company was founded in 2010 so it's not brand new, just small. They are a US based company (pro, under this admin) but have manufacturing set up in a bunch of diff countries (wildcard under this admin).

**Team (important):** I stalk the team on something like this when there's limited data

Founder - Got his PHD in this and started this company so it's his baby. He's a nerd but comes across as a jock. I like that vibe. Unique in this space. I give his stage presence an 8/10. I normally don't like to see a PHD running a company but he's from a state school which is a plus over an Ivy League PHD, IMO.

CEO - guy is very articulate and is good at describing the product without sounding like a snake oil salesmen. I give his stage presence a 7/10.

Engineering team - a lot of nerds who just live to work and have zero hobbies. I like to see this.

Customers: they have a widely-applicable use case and sell to Google, but I couldn't find numbers on that spend. They have some unique value props in healthcare AI. Healthcare is getting destroyed right now and as that sector rebounds I think they will spend even more on AI related things.

**RISKS:**

**-** Brand new stock that IPO'd not long ago. I'm buying post IPO cool-down here. They have never had an earnings.

\- Wearables could stall in general. But as the big guys keep trying this, I think AI wearables are inevitable. I also WANT them personally.

\- No analyst coverage. I had to do my own digging to learn anything about these guys. I even stalked them using some internal company things.

\- 9/4 earnings is a complete crapshoot. This is literally their first one. I dont expect them to be profitable. What I'm looking for is pipeline, guidance and stage presence.

TLDR: this is a speculative bet in an area I am personally familiar with, which is why Im comfortable with the risk. It will be a flier or a complete dog. Do not YOLO into this and come yell at me if you get smoked.

If earnings goes well I'll up the position to $50k (I am risk averse and this is the most I'm comfortable with for this stock). If earnings doesn't go well I'll just hold it as a lottery ticker and add more if I see bullish things.

  

[removed] FORGOT TO ADD THIS:

One of the investors in these guys was Arm Holdings $ARM. Arm designs chips and makes money selling the licensing and royalties to companies like Nvidia etc 

Unsure if bullish or bearish but I like to see it I invested for two reasons…low float and ARM investment. Thanks bro! This is v speculative bc new companies can easily just shit the bed, but I like to have a few long shots in my port at any given time Stopped reading at Dr Nerd Jock, buying starter position Taking out a second mortgage and going full port in my retirement account, along with that of my wife, parents, in laws, friends family and neighbors. All thanks to you! ""He's a nerd but comes across as a jock. I like that vibe. Unique in this space."" OK lemme guess, you are the CEO right? xD Their revenue growth has already completely flat lined since at least 2020 and IPOing at this low valuation is a red flag, running out of money > Engineering team - a lot of nerds who just live to work and have zero hobbies. I like to see this.

1mr2r4k,2025-08-15,"Thanks warren!! Healthcare YOLO's - rolled UNH 250c's -> 400c's & new position in $NVO with profits.

yeah baby, smaller positions but similar!  Balls deep in UNH, NVO and CNC calls A few people asking about these plays.

---

NVO - Ozempic. I know all you regards have heard of this. The calls were cheap. NVO was trading $150 a year ago... it's currently $52. It was $70 two weeks ago. They'll be fine. These LEAPs over double if price hits where it was... 2 weeks ago. Value seems alright

---

UNH 

Why roll the calls? I was overexposed to UNH and I use LEAPs to gain leverage. I doubt I'll hold the 400c's until expiry... however $400+ by EOY 2026 is very doable. I wanted exposure to UNH. Trimming the 250c's would have lowered my leverage / exposure. This is basically a free roll for me now & I like gambling. Yes, I think it's a very achievable price point & I suspect that both of these positions will print.

---

I tend to use LEAPs to gain access to leverage. Buying the furthest expiries I possibly can (Dec 2027) effectively allows me to more or less ""ignore"" theta / time decay. It gives me access to massive amounts of leverage *without having to worry about liquidation risk*. IE: That is what I used the 250c's for. I bought when UNH was ~$240 and sold 7 days later for a 75% gain. 

Goodluck to all. Sometimes I get lucky :) . This NVO position is easily going to net me ~1-1.5mm+ That's what trading calls looks like at the start... the spread f's you a bit. NVO AFTER HOURS, congratulations dude ""A bit?"" - it fucks you hard. I just lost ~30-35k to the spread on these lol.

[EDIT2] We're opening monday > $200k in the profit. Thanks NVO! Jup... big trades turn spreads into significant numbers. Gotta hate the spreads on derivatives It's easy to get greedy... but then I remember all the times I missed and had to hold for 6-12+ months. AMD I'm looking at you...

Suck it UNH bears 
Yeah, you’re a genius for predicting Buffett would buy 5 million shares Warren Buffet is actually his uncle, this is for plausible deniability to blame Reddit. That's what redditors been saying about $snap stock. 95% sentiment is bearish when researching on reddit. I don't hold any since it makes sense what they said. https://preview.redd.it/62zt04peg7jf1.jpeg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8804a396752be2118c7aa6fce56ad29b9a4f9ed6

Fk your gains I debated buying Snap a few times now and then I check a week later and it's hit a new low somehow. Seems like in theory it's wildly undervalued compared to the other tech companies but then again it's ran by a moron They are also under investigation by the government and their shareholders are calling for board members blood. Intel is fucked, now buy calls op. I dare you Well it wasn’t just Buffet, it was 3 GOATed investors so… clearly majority of this sub is retarded.

Buy high sell low right? Never buy low. UNH fell like 15% within two weeks of when he bought it too. Bros bags were carried for him by a nonagenarian. Honestly, I still don’t get why people think it was crazy to see them as they buy. Buffet’s whole thing is supposed to be buying companies when they’re on the operating table and that perfectly describes what’s happening to UNH. 

I don’t really get why people are acting like OP just got lucky or is wrong.

1mqos3l,2025-08-15,"Going big on $GOOGL - Web and Ai giant!
My positions: 1920 shares of $GOOGL. Kept on buying up so don't know what the average price is but around 190s.

Why: $GOOGL $GOOG is arguably one of the best AI companies out there. Google deepmind ( led by demis hasabis) is on par with openai and probably more better. Talent rich, cash rich, growing at scale and expanding.

Moonshots: 
1)Everyone talks about how search will die because of chatGPT etc. No! Earnings for the last 3 quarters have proved re-acceleration in search at almost 11% YoY.

2) YouTube now the most watched form of content. Almost all TV have it and YouTube shorts does 200b of views! Yotube is growing like crazy and content on it is proving to be better then most tv. The new generation will have also grown up on yotube and many have yotube subscription which is also a direct competitor of Spotify- you get free yotube music.

3) GCP - Google cloud. Growing like crazy. Now at $55b run rate. Sundar said they signed more $1B+ deal in the CURRENT quarter, then all of 2024!!! Examples include Salesforce, oracle, OpenAi ( yes them) for compute and GCP. They are growing rapidly due to TPU being super cheap and and cost effective. Constant reinvestment and growth will see them end up with a 100b business in cloud by 2028!!!

4) Gemini - google own LLm. On my benchmarks, this is one of the best models out there. This is being integrated into Google search view Ai overviews + Google ai mode search ( only india and usa have it) try it out. Not only that, they have the best video generation model and world models with Veo 3 & genie 3. Gemini is becoming an enterprise software that many companies are embedding alongside cloud and GCP.

5) stabel growth segments - Google networks are not talked about. Android, play store, Google pixel,  watch and ear phone are in total $50b+ in annual revenue. The upcoming catalyst for this is Pixel 10 release with Google AI embedded in the phone. Google have also entered into the world of VR glasses that will be the most cost effective one. This will be in partnership with eye brand gentle monster who provide hardware for Google software. This will beat Apple ai vision pro and upcoming meta glasses on price point alone.

6) investment - Google are constantly investing into other business and themselves. They have just announced a $9b investment for data centres in Oklahoma. This is in addition to $25b for data centes in usa. They have also announced $6b projection near completion in India- a multi billion industry. They have given all kids in college free google tools and gemini pro to the value of $1B, and have projects going for google fiber for underwater sea cable networks. Rapid expansion across all vertices. They are investing into ai for drug discovery which had began human trials for cancer cures (isomorpic labs) and have constant investments into waymo - which is set to launch outside of USA and begin operations in Japan very soon. A stand alone valuation of waymo is around $150b.

Risk: The doj wants to break up google. They think it's a monopoly. The ruling is due anytime now. Given how unrealistic a break up is likely and could destroy google I don't see it happening. Even the prez of usa himself said he doesn't want them broken up,  he has said google is a innovative American company in tech conference a few weeks ago. I expect some remedial actions out of this which will life alot of risks from google.

Valuation: this is currently trading at cheapest valuation of 20x PE. OR 17x FWD P/E. The next mag 7 close go this is $meta at 29 PE.
A re rating could send $GOOGL on an nvida like run all the way to $280. 

My plays: common shares that I'm selling at $300 + 40k in various calls and leaps. 

Positions from a brokage located outside of Usa/ in nz. 
Holy shit OP how did you find this company? What do they even produce, alphabet soup? Ever since ""Google AI Overview"" I hardly ever scroll down passed the Google Ads anymore... is Google's number one profit maker Google Search cooked due to their own artificial intelligence bot? No because if you heard sundar on the call. AI overview is better monetized this normal search lol. 

It's why they beat 2b on the ad revenues. I have shares and calls too, people saying Google will be disrupted by AI, Google is the AI from robo taxi to veo3 still cheap at $200 Becuase many people do. The first few clicks or suggestions are on a bid based ad market. So they pay alot more for it. Similar to meta ad strategy You had months while it was trading in the 150s and 160s and you choose the 190s lmao 21 P/E ratio it's cheap compared to the other Mag 7 I don't ever see anything or interact with anything when I read it, how is it monetized? I own lots of GOOGL, I make a search and then intentionally click the ad that addresses what I searched for.

1mqjwnb,2025-08-15,"UNH Gains and stupidity - a lesson on covered calls
Closed all other positions two weeks ago and full ported my margin account into UNH. Average cost 259. Felt like this was a huge opportunity. Bought some calls too . 

Unfortunately, I learned about covered calls a few weeks ago and thought they'd be brilliant while sitting on 2500 shares of UNH.  Sold some 8/22 $275s this past week. Almost bought them back today at a 6k loss but said eh whatever. 

With this AH movement my profits essentially capped at 40k and the remaining 70k profit will be called away tomorrow. What a lesson on the dangers of selling calls lol. Profit is profit, but man it's a kick in the guts for a hunch gone right. 


Your hunch was that it would moon and you sold covered calls? Thats not what covered calls are for  ok so your hunch was wrong then lol. Just be happy you made some money on it. Nah. My hunch was that it was oversold and was a great entry as a long term hold. I thought it would sit flat for some time. 

It then bounced heavily and caught me. Do not buy the calls. That’s how you get fucked twice when it crashes afterwards You got the max profit possible from the calls.  This is not your average retarded WSB move.   It was a solid play as you'd get the premium from calls  + dividends 

Also, this is not irretrievable.   Let them get assigned.  Sell your cash secured puts.  Buy back the shares.  

And congrats! You hit max profit. Do not roll cc’s on a volatile stock. 

Just let them get called away and sell ITM puts if you want the shares back and begin the wheel. Learn about rolling covered calls hes getting downvoted because covered calls are unironically one of the best strategies for options trading if you want reliable returns, its just not accessible to brokies and return limited so gooners like you dont like it

There is no analysis or anything. Pure feel. Intel was my first trade I’ve had to pay some tuition on. A solid private university, two semesters worth of gains. I’m running this one up to $10m without falling in love with a company next time. I was 6/6 until Intel. Now im 6/7. 

I got to $154k from $600 on 6 total trades in the IRA. I’m considering this my second attempt. I’m already happy with my wins, but I do believe next week is the confirmation. That’s potentially my sell catalyst. The IRA is being dumped tomorrow on market open. I’m happy with $34k for the real build there. Are you going to hold till 2026?

1mq2eeo,2025-08-14,"1.4m DD GAINZ - $RDDT is still cheap
**Original DD:**[ 1.3m $RDDT Bet - Too Many Ways to Win](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1l37l3m/13m_rddt_bet_too_many_ways_to_win/)

**Updated timeline:** At current execution pace, I expect $300+ within 6 months. The money machine is hitting on all cylinders, and we're still in the early innings of Reddit's transformation. 

Three months ago, I laid out why RDDT is going higher and we are fucking winning! Congrats to everyone who joined in. As of last Friday, the stock is up 80%+ as management started executing on the points I stated in my last DD. They still haven’t touched the speculative stuff yet and they probably won’t for a few years. ARPU is up 47% yoy and they are just getting started. 

**ARPU**

ARPU increased 47% to $4.53 this quarter. The CFO called this ""still very low"" and he's right. Even reaching half of Meta's $12+ yield would more than double current revenue.

Reddit's new ad products are printing money:

* **Dynamic Product Ads (DPA):** 2x higher ROAS than standard campaigns (basically this means Reddit Ads add lots of value to advertisers compared to other sites) 
* **Reddit Community Intelligence**
   * Advertisers can query the collective knowledge from the billions of human conversations that take place on Reddit. 
   * “An advertiser got an idea on the spot for a potential Super Bowl ad next year,” from Reddit Community Intelligence 
* Reddit hired enterprise sales people to get the word out on these new products.
   * **This resulted in 50%+ growth in active advertisers.**

You obviously use Reddit. Turn off your ad blockers and start paying attention to ad quality and frequency because it is dramatically improving. If you don’t believe me, go see for yourself.

**Management Execution**This quarter proves management can execute flawlessly. Jen Wong that beautiful bastard is at the forefront for the advertiser product suite and is driving ARPU growth of 47%.

https://preview.redd.it/5wato4pnuzif1.png?width=1258&format=png&auto=webp&s=204eee5a3d8ff7bce7e9de24490f78b1836b5339

Reddit has barely started capitalizing on the potential they have and still have tons of runway with more shopping features, marketplaces, streaming and premium sub-reddits. Premium sub-reddits will be huge, but not as huge as being able to take market share from Google. 

# Improving Search

Reddit wants users to stay. More eyeballs, more money, and this is an easy problem to solve. Reddit's search is so broken that users Google ""question + Reddit"" instead of searching directly on the platform. Reddit is fixing this by combining traditional search with AI-powered answers in one interface. This model is already proven by current AI products and Reddit is perfectly positioned to grab this pie. Instead of external search > quick answer > exit, users will search internally > find answers > discover communities > scroll.

The monetization impact is huge. Every seeker that becomes a scroller drives exponentially higher ARPU through increased ad exposure and deeper engagement. In the age of dying search engines, Reddit is building their own answer engine that keeps users on the platform and decreases their dependence on search engines for growth. 

# Data Moat Monetization

Reddit has publicly announced that AI companies are rock hard for their data and now they have started to protect it. Reddit recently engaged Cloudflare to block AI webcrawlers from scraping. Microsoft already confirmed Bing is blocked while Google continues indexing due to their licensing deal. [https://searchengineland.com/microsoft-confirms-reddit-blocked-bing-search-444385](https://searchengineland.com/microsoft-confirms-reddit-blocked-bing-search-444385)

Earlier this year Reddit sued Anthropic for unauthorized scraping. Regardless of legal outcomes, Reddit forced them to the negotiating table. Most LLMs still source Reddit data without compensation but that's changing fast. As Cloudflare's CEO perfectly stated: ""AI companies understand that original content is fuel for their engines. The assumption that content will be free is ending.""

https://preview.redd.it/ujgewd2quzif1.png?width=1230&format=png&auto=webp&s=75e8984758601e5d5f2d8cd9d99f484e655fe8e3

Reddit's about to manifest destiny the hell out of AI monetization.

Each of the bots below is another potential contract for Reddit. As Reddit is such a unique and valuable source this gives them much more pricing power than in their previous deals. Now that Reddit’s data is protected, Reddit can receive 10x their current licensing fees. AI companies are extracting billions in value from Reddit's data and soon Reddit will capture their fair share.

# S&P 500 Inclusion

After this last quarter’s earnings report, RDDT is now likely to be added into the S&P 500. QQQ too if RDDT changes its exchange to the NASDAQ. Additionally, the S&P 500 committee will likely find RDDT a compelling addition to the index, as the committee strives to include companies from a diverse range of industries. Reddit is classified under the Internet Content and Information subsector, one of the smallest and least diverse sections of the index; currently there’s only 3 stocks in this sector which makes it the least diverse subsector.

Reddit meets all quantitative criteria and offers the committee exactly what they want, a growing, profitable US company that enhances sector balance while representing emerging economic trends, making Reddit a natural fit for inclusion. 

**Summary**

Management said ARPU growth ""will continue to be a significant opportunity,” and they have proven they can execute on it. With the way management is hustling and executing RDDT still looks cheap.

Im kicking myself for not taking a position in reddit a long time ago when I first considered it, but as a personal rule I do not buy giant green candles like this. It has literally never gone well for me. I do well when I buy fear or find some obscure stock before it catches on. I'll take a position in reddit during the next black swan, but Im not touching it here. Bullish on the company though. I was selected for Reddit community IPO last year. Kicking myself for not doing it. It was like $30. 10k max but still. $10k at $30 would have been $79.4K today lol I first bought Reddit at $115 and added again at $190. Been waiting for a pullback to add but mf is above $240 now 🤣

I remember when I bought Netflix in 2022 for $250 and sold it at $320 ever since then I’ve been watching it in pain til to today where it’s at $1200. 🤦‍♂️🤣 Are you new here? Stonks only go up, stupid. **+47% ARPU is massive, and the new ad products are pulling 2x ROAS. That’s basically locking in long-term growth. S&P 500 inclusion will be another catalyst.** Reddit is the easiest 10x bagger ive seen in a long time. Easily touching $400 by eoy I want to buy, but the last time I bought RDDT over 200 I turned into a bagholder for half a year, which is an eternity for me. Your gainz

1mpxze5,2025-08-14,"What if Google bought Snapchat?
What would be the benefits to $GOOG and to $SNAP?

Ad Powerhouse: Google’s ad tech could supercharge Snapchat’s ads, targeting its Gen Z/Millennial audience for bigger profits.

Tech Boost: Snapchat’s AR (like Lenses) could merge with Google’s AI and cloud, creating next-level features and smoother performance.

User Wins: Snapchat’s Stories and filters could integrate with Google apps (e.g., YouTube, Search), making content easier to find and use.

Social Media Edge: Google could finally compete with Instagram and TikTok by owning Snapchat’s youth-focused platform.

Growth Opportunities: Snapchat could tap Google’s global reach for expansion, plus add e-commerce or creator tools tied to Google’s ecosystem.

Thoughts?

Isn't Snapchat just a bootie call app? Well that’s missing from Google so it wouldn’t invalidate the thesis What if snapchat took a $1T loan from the Russian Mafia and bought Google? Brainrot. how about u eat my ASS

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There are synergies, especially around maps/location, photos, ads, physical hardware (googles, ..) and the social aspect of it.

There are various areas Google tried to compete in (they had their own social network), Glass, photos in maps. One area SNAP has a weakness in:
Presenting user-generated content in their maps tab, it's not very intuitive or functional. Google could help with that (imagine better maps, layers, reviews, permanent vs temp photos, vibe check for events, music,..)

I think it would be a good idea, as long as they can sell to the younger SC users that they won't store their secret snaps forever. That would cause all kinds of turmoil anti trust wise.

	•	Details: A five-year, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract worth up to $290 million, covering monitoring of economic, environmental, and military activity using high-frequency imagery and AI-driven analytics. 

6. $6M Contract Expansion – Legacy International Defense Customer
	•	Date Awarded: October 1, 2024
	•	Details: An expansion of an existing subscription for Gen-2, high-cadence imagery—adding approximately $6 million, bringing annual commitment to nearly $18 million. 

7. EOCL Extension – National Reconnaissance Office 
	•	Date Awarded: June 5, 2024
	•	Details: A one-year extension of the ongoing Electro-Optical Commercial Layer (EOCL) contract. This continues Gen-2 imagery services under a 10-year framework, with BlackSky being the first to integrate with a new government imagery ordering system. 

Bottom Line: BlackSky has significantly strengthened its position in the intelligence and defense markets through a steady stream of high-value, long-duration contracts since mid-2024. This includes both U.S. government and international partners, spanning multi-million to hundreds of millions in value. Their model blends subscription-based imagery services, AI-powered analytics, and next-gen satellite technologies (Gen-3 and Gen-2), often with committed capacity and ground system modernization.
I work in this industry - BKSY is all marketing. Look at their last earnings. $2M annual rev increase over the last year? Their satellite imagery is too low of quality for their “ai” to actually work. 

Plus - they’re gonna get fucked by the US Gov with contract re-negotiations this year. I’d stay very, very far away. Ya an ant with a small pecker and small bank account :( Been in BKSY since it was in the 22s, got some $16s when it dipped. 


If you like them, you’ll like PL too. i like, i like Get PL instead What is this? A trade for ants?

1mpffb9,2025-08-13,"$UNH leaps - Up N' Holding to Unlimited New Heights - 6 days later & added a few contracts

Holding 200 shares at average cost of 278.24 - DCA'ing every day (25 bucks a day) - and selling covered calls. LFG Last thursday I was looking at UNH and bought 2 minutes before close. Clearly I timed the bottom & I'm liking how the UPNL looked. So... I maxed out this account. Timing the market is better than time in the market

Goodluck to all I agree with any DCA < ~$350 (hence these bets). But why are you selling covered calls? You're making a small premium at the risk of losing the upside on large movements. How far out are you selling the CC's at? The way I see it - is I cannot predict short term movements. Anything short term is gambling - either buying or selling options. I've seen 'stable' stocks move > 10% in a single day / after hours before and I don't like taking those types of bets. Selling calls (or covered calls) limits upside and scraping up the pennies may not be worth it IF we see those large movements... Great you collect a few% premium per month but missed the 25-50%+ upside when it *did* move.

I *highly* suspect by 2028 the stock will be > ~$310 (it was there 5 weeks ago) - which means these will be profitable. That's the only bet that I am taking here... at which point every $1 over ~310 it is these profit $13.4k.

The downside is imo limited here. Hence my bets. I was looking at sentiment / have been tracking this one for ~6 months. I noticed a drop in activity /mentions / regarded bets on various forums I follow. Typically this suggests that it's lost popularity / favor with the average person... and often is a fairly strong signal we are fairly close to the bottom. I haven't seen UNH mentioned in a month or so... hence my play. The gamblers mostly got shaken imo Congrats bro! Good pick, and this is the insane cherry on top I'll probably be up about ~250k tomorrow on my leaps because of this news :D Thanks! Been following UNH for ~6 months and decided to finally buy the dip, glad I pulled the trigger when I did! Seems I got within a few dollars of the bottom.

The selloff was an overreaction. Seems buffet & burry agree. Lots of smart money has been buying. UNH mispriced their plans for a year... so they come up with new ones and increase premiums by 1-2%. Revenue of 450b and profits of a few b. Their margins are super small. So all the have to do is increase premiums ever so slightly and all lost profits come back.

Revenue increased by 13% YoY and isn't going to slow. They'll be fine. He did. I went for a run yesterday The thing I personally dislike about selling calls / options - is it's basically anti my gambling side. I love hitting the 5-10x, even if there's only a 5% chance. Selling CC's removes that opportunity :( .

Back to 20 we go! Meme stocks will come back with SPY at ATHs, rate cuts incoming, crypto mooning. KSS quietly went from 10.50 to over 14 the past few days..🙏
Upvote because you got some balls buying $20k worth of fds on fucking Kohls. This is going much higher than $20/share. Book value is $34/share and is much actually higher as the real estate on the books is not marked to market.  Sales I believe will show growth this quarter as the De Minimis loophole for cheap Chinese goods was closed. Temu, SHEIN and TikTok Shop did over $130B in revenue last year and grew this essentially over the last 3 years at the expense of US retailers. It is closed now and I expect sales to flow back to US sellers. 

Shorts are going to get scorched on this one, I would not be surprised if KSS exceeds $70/share in the next two years. And yes, I’m regarded. WSB : YEAH KSS PUMP IS OVER \*bans every kss post\*  
Meanwhile r/KSSBulls : quietly printing money lol  
  
This bad boy is very undervalued  
Nearly all of my entire portfolio is in Kohl's and I don't regret. Earnings contracts will print like nothing never before I’ve posted on several boards about this closure and the impact it will have for US retailers. $130B is the annual revenues of TGT and M combined, it is HUGE. Erosion in sales seen over the last 3 years was mainly due to Chinese sellers IMO. Winners will be WMT, TGT, M, KSS.  All experienced sales losses the last 3 years except WMT which was impacted by food inflation of 25% over the last 3 years as they are the largest grocer in the US. I thought I was the only KSS retard left

1mpc9rk,2025-08-13,"Apple Plans ‘AI Return’ w/ Lifelike Siri, Robots, and Home Security
Apple Inc. is plotting its artificial intelligence comeback with an ambitious slate of new devices, including robots, a lifelike version of Siri, a smart speaker with a display and home-security cameras.
Apple car v2 anyone? Apple AI Vision Pro I‘m bearish about this News, so calls it is I've been hoping for Apple to make something significant in this area for such a long time. I want apple food already An Apple? What team do they expect to do this with? Apple has lost the majority of the important Ai folks in the past year?  
  
And when does Apple expect to do this? We still don’t even have Apple Intelligence and that’s been pushed back to 2026 I was thinking calls until I saw your comment. Puts it is Ya that’s what I need, an Apple powered robot with Siri inside so it can stop in the middle of performing a critical task to remind me to register it or buy an upgrade to complete the task faster…. Hard fucking pass i feel as if it’s a meme to hate on Vision Pro and a lot of it is fair 

but eventually a sort of _enabling threshold_ will be met where a AI AR device is practical for adoption reaching critical mass  

tbh between Zuck spending billions on hiring, data centres, acquisitions, and partnerships with optical brands, if Apple doesn’t push into AI AR more, Meta is gonna eat their lunch

the recently released Oakley Meta HSTN are pretty impressive in terms of video capture and AI assistant, and give it a few more years HUD improvements + battery improvements…  it won’t be long before every time you see someone wearing sunglasses you’ll be unsure if they’re live streaming you or not.

Tried to post DD last week, got shut down by the autobot. Wrote about an HVAC refrigerant supplier with a patented product, OEM adoption, data center cooling angle, and a legal overhang that just got resolved.

Couldn’t share it then, but the trade worked anyway. Stock broke its downtrend and now I’m up nicely.
Yo I wish mods would let good post like this through before the gains Mods love blocking plebs from early DD. They just allow the ones post-pump. I tried. Kept changing the wording. I even posted to another sub before so I could fine tune it before posting in wsb. I will post the thesis in the comments Saw insiders buying a couple of days ago i thought it was just a boring chemical stock Yes, little luck involved in the timing but I have been watching the stock for a while and charts make it appear that most the pain is over Look up openinsider its a pretty useful site I guess you also saw the update about their two stage liquidity cooling.

1mp7nya,2025-08-13,"$3M on Unity - My DD for U
**Position**     

3000 call options for January 2026 with a 30 USD strike price; you can also see in my previous postings that I hadn’t sold when we were at almost $40 and then when it went all the way down, I added to my Unity position. 

  
**Disclaimer**

This isn’t financial advice. This is all just for your entertainment.

**TLDR of the TLDR**

Unity can do an AppLovin stock move if Unity’s new AI-Powered ad Platform Vector succeeds. So far, Vector has “far exceeded our expectations” according to the CEO Bromberg 1 week ago. My 1 year price target is $200. That would represent around half of AppLovin’s current market cap; their main competitor in the ad space. Unity powers 70% of mobile games with their engine (Unity software is on 2.5 billion devices - you read that right, read it again and maybe one more time. This also includes the China market… ), but until Vector they haven’t really capitalized on this potential moat. In the short-term gamma squeezes and even a short squeeze (9.28% shorted) are possible because various whales are buying OTM call options en masse and up to 88.26% of Unity is institutionally held and most positions have been made when the stock was over $100 (according to Fintel) which creates illiquidity as institutions likely won’t want to sell a turn-around stock in a bull market when they are still in the minus. In other words, if you bet on Unity, you are riding together with the whales. And if you think gaming has a future and ads will play a role, especially on mobile phones and VR (60% of VR games are made with Unity), and you are still here, you might as well read my intro and the TLDR. 

  
[https://images.fintel.io/us-u-so.png](https://images.fintel.io/us-u-so.png) 

  
**About me**

I went from 27k to 5M+ in less than 2 years (see my previous posts on WSB), but I also lost 180k back in the SPAC days and had to start again from scratch. This taught me that I should only invest in undervalued  companies that have some sort of actual moat. Previously I went with long-term calls into PLTR at around $8 and then into SOFI at around $7 (which btw at that time people also argued were overvalued). Unity is my third and only play. The rest I have in cash. My life hasn’t changed much (only my parents know and 2 friends), but whatever happens, I’ll be able to create an animal shelter for homeless dogs and other animals. 

**TLDR**

Unity is a turn-around, it has almost 0 interest from the retail community (try yourself and search on YouTube or X if anything received lots of interactions in the recent 1-2 years. This is good, because we are so early that no popular finfluencer is covering it), it’s actually even hated among retail because of Unity’s previous management and its runtime fee non-sense. Since their new CEO Bromberg took over 15 months ago, Unity not only reversed the runtime fee decisions, but also double beat on their earnings each time. Last week they did it again and analysts all upgraded Unity stock based on the most recent quarter. Still the stock is beaten down when you look at the 5 year chart (Unity used to trade above $200). I am not a technical trader, but I like beaten down stocks that are in the accumulation zone for years while the underlying company double beats each quarter and keeps growing. I like it even more when we are now witnessing the first great results of an AI product that hasn’t even started yet - Vector. It reminds me of when Palantir introduced their AIP bootcamps, their game changer. Ok, I tricked you. The TLDR of the TLDR and this TLDR are actually just an introduction. You might as well read the rest now. At least try to read the next sentence and see if it gets you hooked for more. 

**AppLovin, Unity’s main competitor**

AppLovin (Ticker APP - check out what their stock did in the last 12 months as inspiration) tried to buy Unity in 2022 for $58.85 per share and Unity rejected because they much rather wanted to compete with AppLovin in ads since Unity has the better moat (they provide the engine on which the games run). Based on some rumors they tried buying them a second time last year. However often AppLovin really tried to buy Unity, I am relieved that I could still invest in Unity. 

**Secret whale(s)**

In the background there’s an investor or multiple investors that have been putting $40M+ in the last few weeks on Unity OTM call options. Whoever that is, they got balls of steel as they are riding all ups and downs like a madman and keep accumulating. Yesterday alone around $10M was added to this Friday’s options chain. If Unity holds above $37.50 until Friday, we might see a gamma squeeze. Also, with up to 90% institutional ownership, where the majority is way underwater, thus likely not selling (which makes the stock illiquid) and Unity being almost 10% shorted, we might see a short squeeze. It’s not my main investment thesis, but definitely fun to watch this unfold. It’s still a big if, so don’t bet on it.      

**Unity and AppLovin experts**

If you don’t believe me because I am just claiming to be a wizard and can’t even write wizard, make sure to invest 3 hours of your time to watch 2 podcasts of the GameMakers (one is from Apr 8, 2025 and the other one is from June 10th, 2025; you can find it on YT) and watch how they are slowly changing their opinion full of skepticism towards Unity’s new Vector platform to seeing some potential opportunity for Unity to then 5 days ago Josh Chandley, Co-Founder at WildCard (mobile) Games, posting this:

  
[https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joshchandley\_%F0%9D%97%A8%F0%9D%97%BB%F0%9D%97%B6%F0%9D%98%81%F0%9D%98%86%F0%9D%98%80-%F0%9D%98%80%F0%9D%98%81%F0%9D%97%BC%F0%9D%97%B0%F0%9D%97%B8-%F0%9D%97%B1%F0%9D%97%BF%F0%9D%97%BC%F0%9D%97%BD%F0%9D%97%BD%F0%9D%97%B2%F0%9D%97%B1-%F0%9D%9F%B2-activity-7359210962823909376-VEah/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=member\_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAGIzIkBUdZilpoVRXo18tu0TjDzcMZLfr8](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joshchandley_%F0%9D%97%A8%F0%9D%97%BB%F0%9D%97%B6%F0%9D%98%81%F0%9D%98%86%F0%9D%98%80-%F0%9D%98%80%F0%9D%98%81%F0%9D%97%BC%F0%9D%97%B0%F0%9D%97%B8-%F0%9D%97%B1%F0%9D%97%BF%F0%9D%97%BC%F0%9D%97%BD%F0%9D%97%BD%F0%9D%97%B2%F0%9D%97%B1-%F0%9D%9F%B2-activity-7359210962823909376-VEah/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAGIzIkBUdZilpoVRXo18tu0TjDzcMZLfr8) 

  
And have a look who is liking this. Multiple employees in senior roles at Unity wouldn’t outright confirm any numbers obviously (they like to sandbag and then doublebeat at the earnings). So, feel free to have a look at this LinkedIn posting and check for yourself how many Unity employees liked that posting. It’s around 50+ Unity employees. Here’s one senior employee:

  
[https://ibb.co/0RfpB8YB](https://ibb.co/0RfpB8YB)

  
**Unity partners**

Not surprisingly as the biggest engine provider in the world Unity is partnered with Apple, Google, Microsoft, Nintendo, Meta (for the Oculus) and Sony (for the PlayStation), but also with Tencent to help developers bring more games to China. They are also partnered with lots of other companies, even multiple car manufacturers (Mercedes-Benz, Toyota etc.) to create 3D models.

**Macro cycle**

We never know what Trump is up to and if we will get the next recession this year, next year or with the next president. But what we know is that we are at all-time-highs. Typically in all-time-highs the more speculative and smaller cap stocks go up. Unity fundamentally isn’t a highly speculative stock, but it is perceived as one. So, even if you think that we will soon have a recession, Unity might as well go up in the short-term. For the intermediate term in case of a recession, millions of people losing their jobs would cause what? 4 years ago when people lost their jobs and were at home they were playing (mobile) games and many programmers also created games. This was the time when Unity stock was above $200. And now with generative AI it will be even easier to create new mobile games. Unity is still the best game engine for new developers. In short, I am not too worried about Unity even if a recession hits anytime soon.  

**Unity red flag:**

Yes, I am honest here. There’s also something critical about Unity. I am fine with stock-based-compensation. That’s normal for such companies to keep talent and attract more talent. But when I read through Glassdoor reviews, Unity employees emphasize the great work-life-balance… Sorry, but if any Unity employees read this: AppLovin has eaten your breakfast, lunch and dinner in the last few years. True, you previously had really bad management. But now with your CEO Bromberg and Vector you have a real chance to eat their dessert. That’s the best food anyway. So, in the next 9-12 months keep pushing like never before to get it! I believe in unity. You have been waiting for this long enough.   
>I went from 27k to 5M+ in less than 2 years

That's all I needed, I'm all fucking in > But you gotta do the DD

I did, my DD was follow the nerd who has $3mil But you gotta do the DD always irrespective if you go into Unity or another stock. For example when I was 75%+ down with my SOFI way out of the money call option position and I was all-in, I could still sleep well because of the DD I did. If you don't know what you are buying, people panic sell. Unity is very volatile as it is not very liquid. Huge upswings and downswings can make you doubt. You borrowed my conviction. That's fair. I hope the money you put in is also not... ah nevermind. Let's ride this! Not reading all that. Put 25k between options and stocks. Make me rich OP. What about the fact theyve never been profitable and still arent ? bro you are comparing cult with a gaming company ffs Screw it bro, I’m in. Buying $3M……..in simulator >But at any point Unity can snap their fingers and become profitable.

Oh you mean like that one time they tried and lost 90% stock value Good point, but also consider this: PLTR was also never profitable until recently and was trading around 8 USD when I got in. 

  
As for Unity when you go through my DD (also watch the YT podcasts where 4 game devs are talking in depth), you will see Unity is on a clear path with Vector.

1mp3ail,2025-08-13,"$ROOT vs $LMND - Who is the best tech-enabled insurer? ROOT wins by a lot in my opinion
Lemonade ($LMND) has been flying lately, but when you compare the actual fundamentals side-by-side with its most direct competitor Root ($ROOT), it’s hard to justify the current market reaction. ROOT is profitable, growing faster, trading at a fraction of LMND’s valuation, and has analyst price targets that point to huge upside. Meanwhile, LMND is still losing hundreds of millions annually, carries a higher price-to-sales multiple, and has yet to prove a path to sustained profitability.

ROOT just posted a monster quarter: EPS of $1.29 vs. expectations around $0.52, revenue of $382.9M beating estimates, and year-over-year revenue growth of roughly 60%. This is not only faster growth than LMND, it’s growth with profits. At $90, ROOT trades at roughly 1x sales and a forward P/E in the teens — levels you rarely see for a profitable, high-growth tech/AI-enabled insurer. Compare that to LMND, which trades at ~5x sales despite continued losses.

The only reason ROOT sold off post-earnings was because management announced accelerated investment in AI and technology, along with a one-time non-cash warrant expense expected next quarter. These near-term margin hits are the same type of “story over reaction” we saw when Meta announced massive AI spend in late 2022. Investors sold the dip then, and Meta went on to more than triple as the returns on that investment became clear. ROOT’s investments are aimed squarely at improving underwriting efficiency, lowering loss ratios, and scaling faster — all of which strengthen the long-term business.

Analysts currently have price targets in the $126–$148 range(60-80% upside), with some higher. Even at the low end analysts see at least 30% upside. My personal target is $250 within the next year based on a modest P/E multiple applied to projected earnings. That’s nearly 3x from here, and I believe the combination of profitable growth, low valuation, and technology-driven margin expansion makes ROOT one of the most asymmetric opportunities in the market today. The current price reflects short-term noise, not the long-term trajectory.

To me ROOT seems like an absolute no brainer at this level relative to LMND. Stronger fundamentals, profitable, better valuation, investing in AI, .. the list goes on.

I have 12,619 shares at $88/share.

Let me know if I am missing something but to me this seems like an easy home run unless there is some potential black swan event I am missing.
LMND is the dreamer, ROOT is the doer — one’s telling stories, the other’s making money. Used ChatGPT to get some data for that. Root is primarily auto insurer, while Lemonade started in auto and then expanded into other markets. Lemonade has a lower customer acquisition cost compared to Root ($175 vs $330) which makes it a more efficient + they using AI (market happy to embed AI premium these days)
Lemonade also expected to achieve a higher revenue growth in comparison to Root - hence valuation premium

The question is then for you - are you comfortable in keeping stock that can drop 40% and can grow 100% in the future, or if you prefer something more stable

Btw, it’s wallstreetbets - we have no idea what to do Lemonade started with renters insurance and have since expanded, they just recently got into auto. You've bet the wrong company, dude.

$LMND is 100% AI while $ROOT is about to embark on the AI journey.

$LMND will reach $200 this time next year.  And it's still trading at $58.

I am not a financial adviser and am holding $LMND shares. But ROOT only does auto Nah i bet on the right one $ROOT All day. Gonna print all month They are in home insurance but they suck Ps.

1molleu,2025-08-12,"GOOGLE Chrome For Sale?
An offer to buy $GOOGL search chrome browser for $34.5b by so called AI firm perplexity.

Considering the amount of billions in R&D that Google has spent in developing this and the fact chrome brings around $200b revenue a year, I think the $34.5b might not be accepted ( no shit!).

This wasnt a legitimate offer but more for media attention and the CEO of perplexity has done a good job.

  
The DOJ judge Amit Mehta has his ruling coming anytime soon as to what the DOJ does. Worst case was a break up of chrome and a sale - but this would appear to be really unfair given how many LLM/search apps are now present vs 2 years ago. The free market wont be free with DOJ interfering with business operations for $GOOGL. 

If the outcome isnt dramatic, $GOOGL could get a re-rating to 25x FWD EPS which would send it flying to $260 and carry $SPY for a while. The company is severally undervalued on many fronts as proven by the last earnings. Lets hope the government has some common sense and doesnt ruin a great American company. 
Idiots. I just downloaded it for free Google pays that to apple yearly….

**Position: 6000 shares**

**Preface**: In recent months Ondas Holdings Incorporated has seen a rapid surge of its share price and market valuations. From a recent low of 69 cents on the 20th of March to almost hitting 4 dollars on Friday, this stock has seen a 414% increase (as per the Friday close of 3.55), however I do believe that ONDS has much much further room to grow, as I will explain in this post. 

# Addressing the Elephant in the room

https://preview.redd.it/cegd00i32eif1.jpg?width=612&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=173a56cc2e2535d0892e50f76bcecbd785a0a39b

A surge of 414% from the absolute lows is a massive increase, and many fellow regards would tell me “Pack it up, it’s already mooned. Another memestock to be rugpulled on lmao” 

I tend to disagree, not only do I disagree with putting ONDS as a memestock, but I also believe that ONDS has not yet begun to showcase just how much they can grow. YES, the share price has soared, but I believe that in the coming months and years we will see the valuation of the company increase further, with incoming government contracts, partnerships and a much stronger balance sheet. 

# Little to no risk of dilution at these prices

* KLEAR: For non-dilutive working capital to fuel growth in defense and drone technologies.  KLEAR serves as Ondas’ preferred working capital finance partner. The collaboration provides non-dilutive financing, meaning it allows Ondas and its affiliated companies to access liquidity without issuing new equity or diluting existing shareholders’ stakes. This is achieved through KLEAR’s embedded capital tools, liquidity planning, and treasury management infrastructure, designed to reduce financial friction for smaller suppliers and technology innovators who often face restricted access to credit markets.

# Strong Balance Sheet

# ONDS Future Plans

* The investment of Rift Dynamics (producer of drones in Norway) and their Wåsp Drone is a crucial and cheap to drone warfare for FPV drones.  Eric Brock, the CEO of Ondas Holdings Inc., is expected to join the Board of Directors of Rift Dynamics AS upon the closing of a strategic investment and partnership agreement between the two companies. The partnership grants Ondas' subsidiary, American Robotics(iron drone), exclusive distribution rights for Rift Dynamics' Wåsp drone platform in the U.S. defense market.  source: [https://www.riftdynamics.io/](https://www.riftdynamics.io/)  
* Optimus System (AI-powered autonomous drone platform) and Iron Drone Raider (counter-drone system), targeting industrial, defense, and homeland security markets. The company plans to increase production to meet a $28.7 million order backlog, including $14.3 million for Optimus Systems and $8.0 million for Iron Drone Raiders.  
* The company is growing its operational footprint in the U.S. and Europe, with additional demonstrations planned in the coming months, and targeting engagements in the Middle East and Asia, including NATO countries and major governmental clients. with successful drone pilot programs in Europe and Asia, particularly for the Iron Drone Raider system, which completed tests in five operational scenarios. The company sees significant opportunities in NATO countries and other regions due to shifting defense spending policies.
* aims to strengthen its presence in defense, homeland security, public safety, and critical infrastructure markets. This includes expanding its Iron Drone Raider system, which has shown success in live combat environments and secured a $3.4 million order in Europe.
* Ondas is committed to advancing its AI-powered drone technologies and private industrial wireless networks. The company aims to lead in drone-as-a-service and counter-UAS (unmanned aerial systems) technologies, capitalizing on rising global demand, particularly in defense and rail communication sectors
* Partnerships with companies like Detroit Manufacturing Systems and Palantir Technologies aim to boost U.S. drone production and integrate AI-powered solutions, respectively. scaling of its autonomous drone platforms, such as the Optimus 1-Ex, which received historic U.S. FAA Type Certification.

# Competitors and future of the Industry

   \-  Skydio and DJI. Both are private companies that make drones and their own software.

   \-  UAVs(Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) are a growing industry in modern times especially for modern warfare and defense. Also they’re (wasp) cheap and disposable to use, making for companies to produce them at mass of thousands at the ready to deploy. 

\-  The commercial drone market is on a steep upward trajectory. By 2025, the market is estimated to reach $40.6 billion, surging to $57.8 billion by 2030. Key segments include:

* **Services**: Projected at $29.4 billion by 2025, encompassing flight operations, engineering, training, and consulting.
* **Hardware**: Valued at $6.7 billion by 2025, the fastest-growing segment.
* **Software**: Expected to hit $1.7 billion by 2025.
* Public Safety and Emergency Response: Increased use in border security, disaster management, and firefighting, also U.S. Army exercises and NATO operations.
* **Infrastructure and Inspections**: Autonomous scans using lidar and thermal imaging for energy, construction, and urban planning.
*  Tools for predicting windy urban conditions to support air taxis and crowded skies.
* In August 2025, the FAA proposed a rule to normalize BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line Of Sight) operations, enabling broader uses like package delivery and public safety while enhancing safety.

For Regards who don’t have the time to read this: Ondas is positioning itself as a key defense & industrial drone player with non-dilutive financing, proven partnerships, global expansion, and product certification milestones. The mix of FAA policy shifts, NATO demand, and scalable low-cost drone platforms could create a multi-year growth runway, especially if execution stays consistent.

Believe it or not, calls definitely calls. the article says this only applies to chips that the companies sell in China. the tariffs will be offset by, you know, actually being able to sell in china now More like China hit with 15% markup on NVDA and AMD chips. How is this not blackmail? Pay 15% or face restrictions. Fuck man this is regarded in sooo many levels Yeah OP needs to modify the headline - this isn't a 15% tariff -- it is a 15% charge on revenue against Nvidia/AMD on sales they make to China.  At best its a 'reverse tariff' and is unprecedented.  This is being done to enable the issuance of an export license.

  
Any business in the US that requires an export license may be having a pretty uneasy Sunday night - if they're about to get a shakedown of 15% on revenue in order to continue making sales. Booooombaclaat Welcome to the new US. No different than Putin forcing his oligarchs to pay up. The US has truly become a mob state that believes in isolationism. 

Only so long before investors start to look elsewhere Wait a minute i thought the other countries were gonna pay the tariff not our companies- Agent Orange Double down, bullish We already pumped on news that export restrictions being lifted though, so this is more a pull-back if anything.

Like… the most bearish position I would ever consider entering is still bullish. SPY shares (instead of calls) The plunge protection team been working 24/7 overtime since liberation day Puts on Monday morning sound nice Cause ppl are brainwashed (including myself)
I think market can go higher and it keeps printing new ATH… and keep loading on puts hoping rug pull and quick crash … but that day never comes.. at least when I am in the play .. You do realise a high put/call ratio is bullish yes? It’s a contrarian indicator - most people lose money so if most ppl are short we go up. Good question. I much prefer buying stock in companies I'm excited about...not ones I'm rooting to fail. Only time I've really ever been short is after Elon Musk threw a sig heil on a national stage twice.

1mllmwq,2025-08-09,"$7.5k -> $29k in two days
Lost 40% of my entire portfolio after going all in on Figma IPO taking me down to $7.5k. This was after I told myself I would stop trading options and focus more on shares only to YOLO at the very top. After such a loss I felt I had no choice but to move every penny of what I had back into my options account to try and save things and as regarded as that may have been I got very lucky.

On Thursday I bought SPY puts turning 3k into 19k and at close bought calls expiring the next day again timing the top and bottom to make another nice gain. MSTR puts also made me an additional $3.5k

Gonna take out around 20k now and go back to shares, no more IPO's or silly penny stocks. Will continue to gamble the rest in true regard fashion 🫡

I was able to get only 10 at IPO and missed the entire run to $180. But, I moved my other investments and some gains during the start of this week when it dropped. Planning to invest more in $CRWV as I am able to add funding. Earnings will reported on 12th Aug + $NVDA earnings later. 

VAMOOOOOSSS!!!  🚀 🚀 🚀
going back to 200

datacenters and datacenter infrastructure are the best opportunity in the market right  now

only $NVDA can make the chips because $AMD is trash. $CRWV gets first best access to $NVDA chips. $CRWV #1. I like $NBIS more. Higher upside potential imo. AMD chips are on par, heck they even raised prices because of how well they did in comparison. Software is catching up too.  I am on the NBIS train as well after doubling up my initial position in CoreWeave before exiting. Both are solid plays for the near/long term but NBIS is a much cleaner play for the near term as I foresee way more volatility in CoreWeave with the Lock up period coming soon ali g with the crazy amount of debt they have built up.

Part of me wishes I had not gotten out of Corewweave entirely when I did as they ran to $180 but when I saw the recent drop to below the $120 which I exited at it made me feel much better about my initial decision. I can handle volatility but that is another level of swing You gotta remember NBIS can swing like that too. In April it dropped from 50 (my initial entry) to 18, and I panic sold at 25 thinking it was fucked due to the tarrifs, well that was a bad idea and I lost a good bit from it. Lol. 🤡 I’m too lazy to write up a DD, but here’s their Q2 financial results. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1mk0tup/nebius_rockets_on_q2_beat_revenue_soars_625_ai/

They just destroyed revenues. I would do some decent investigating if I were you. I doubled down after these results. Basically they own 3 companies AVRide, Toloka (Jeff Bezos invested), and their cloud computing (Nebius). They also own 30% of ClickHouse. Investigate each of these companies. I have high conviction Nebius will be a 100B company in 5 years. 

I own 1010 shares at a 55$ avg. Yeah but the entire stock market was impacted in April with “liberation day” announcement - with 2 earnings report from NBIS since then which have absolutely crushed it with more room to run in the coming quarters I am willing to deal with NBIS volatility over what I have seen from CoreWeave Lunch time sell off. You’re probably right with the 141 top today. Paying special attention to overnight and 10am to noon price tomorrow. I go in around 110 so might as well protect some of my profits just in case.

1mlap84,2025-08-08,"$600,000 $AMD call option trade + $1.2m hedge
TLDR: AMD finally caught up to NVDA, the market doesn’t realize, go giga long $AMD. 

Buy $TLT just incase market crashes so you don’t blow your account up in a black swan, or if thesis is wrong. 


Trade Setup:
	•	33% Portfolio: AMD calls 12/17/27, $360 strike (111% out of the money as of today)
	•	66% Portfolio: $TLT shares (U.S. Treasury bonds)

$AMD Thesis In A Nutshell:

$NVDA market cap: $4.4T
$AMD market cap: $270B

The world is in a massive race to get more chips, and NVDA looks on track for a $10T market cap.

For the first time starting this quarter, AMD’s MI355X is on par with NVDA, with cheaper chips. Sam Altman promoted the MI400 and MI450 at an AI event earlier this year. Hyperscaler consensus is that they are testing the MI350 this year to get familiar with integrating AMD into their data centers, so they will be ready to place big orders next year for the rack scale MI400 and MI450. This was noted on the most recent earnings call.

From here on, AMD’s chips will be on par, if not better, than NVDA for inference, which both Jensen Huang and Sam Altman agree will grow 1000x+ from current demand levels. Jensen said this on the GP2 podcast interview.

In 2024, AMD did $12B in data center revenue with inferior chips, while NVDA did $115B. If AMD can do $55B in 2027, which is half of NVDA’s 2024 data center revenue, it is easily a $1T company, or an $800 stock.

Everything suggests AMD will have a competitive product at a competitive price point, with demand setting up to be off the charts in 2026 and 2027, similar to NVDA’s neck breaking 2023 and 2024 growth rates of 100%+.

Second Leg Of Trade:

If there is a recession or a black swan event, the Fed will cut rates and send TLT soaring, making up for a $0 AMD option. This is a simple hedge against a Covid style scenario.

Best Case:
	•	TLT gains 50% to 100% from rate cuts on 66% of my portfolio
	•	AMD 4x in 2.5 years from AI chip demand, with calls returning 20x on 33% of my portfolio

Base Case:
	•	AMD calls go to $0 if NVDA outcompetes AMD like in past AI failures such as MI300
	•	TLT rises as rates come down, which recovers the call premiums and results in break even in about 2.5 years

Worst Case:
	•	AMD calls go to $0
	•	TLT drops because inflation spikes, resulting in a 30% loss there as well. This is unlikely in my opinion but possible.

MI350X and MI355X should already drive healthy growth for AMD. However, MI400 will be the real game changer because of its scalability. AMD already raised the price for MI350, which just went into production, to $25,000 per chip. MI400 will be a true rack scale solution, making it highly competitive for large cluster projects.

1ml9qje,2025-08-08,"Analysis of Earnings Reports for Week 08/04
I've been reviewing the winning options bets from companies featured in Earning Whispers that have reported earnings this week.

These have been my conclusions.

# Options that have doubled or more in value

**At the market opening**

Calls: BCRX, BWXT, DD, ANET, ALAB, SHOP, DUOL, CELH, SOUN

Puts: NVTS, VRTX, BRBR, ETN, SMCI, SNAP, CLOV, FUN, SYM, FTNT, LLY, TTD, PINS, TWLO, SLVM

**Throughout the day**

Calls: W, FRPT, AXON, LSCC, PFE, LMND, MCD, APP, SONY, RKLB, KTOS, TEM, CGC

Puts: BRK.B, ON, TGTX, AMD, UPST, GEO, ELF, JOBY, ESTA, SMR, PAA, PAR

**It took more than a day**

Some options expire on the 15th, so maybe more will make it, although I doubt it.

Calls: TSN, PLTR, BP

Puts: HIMS, CAT, OPEN

# Straddles that have doubled or more in value

Straddle means buying both calls and puts, betting that there will be a big move, without knowing which direction.

**At the market opening**

VRTX, BWXT, FTNT, TTD, SLVM

**Throughout the day**

BRBR, LMND, ANET, ALAB, SHOP, FUN, DUOL, CELH, LLY, SOUN, CGC, PAR

**It took more than a day**

None

# Points to keep in mind

1. Data from Google Finance and Yahoo Finance.
2. Some stocks had very little or no options volume.
3. **In the post-earnings option price I am not taking into account the time value.**
4. For the strike I always use the closest to the closing price.

https://preview.redd.it/chlob1ywqvhf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b22eeedaee44db4f79d0cdb93701474ec737eb68

A stock has no options and another did not trade any put on 08/07/2025 with strike 17.5 and I made up the price (the one in red in the last image).

Why do companies that even their CEO doesn't know appear on Earnings Whispers?

# Is there a winning strategy?

When someone posts that they've gone from 100k to 200k with one of these plays I wonder:

Why didn't that person post the 100k YOLO?

Wouldn't that person be willing to publish his losses out of shame if he lost?

There are always people betting on both sides, there are always winners and losers.

What's the point of this then?

I would love to see someone go from 1k or 10k to 1M or more with several winning bets in a row.

1k \* 2\^10 = 1,024,000

10k \* 2\^7 = 1,280,000

Can anyone really get it right 7 times in a row?

With a lot of luck, you can even multiply by more than 2 and need to get it right less often.

I hope you share your opinion. Thanks for reading.

survival bias, the dude who lost 1mil and wants to kill himself anit making a reddit post for karma. run the following:   
all calls/puts/straddles across the board,  cost vs profit for one contract each.   
would be interesting study to run, basically do a weekly diversified yolo where you divide your float across all these companies earnings and buy as much as you can with the reserved amount.   
then you repeat the next week, and so on. Also notice that many of the ""YOLOs"" are not even YOLOs, they are gains, the big move has already happened. And when do you sell?

1ml3wvg,2025-08-08,"Final NVDA Q2 Earnings Estimates: A New Challenger Appears!
**TL;DR at the bottom--** [**previous DD** ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1m5yp45/muted_results_but_booming_guidance_nvda_q2/)**on Q2 Earnings, my wrist is healing well thank you**  


# Leaning into AI Criticism: 

On every post I make that is longer than 5 complete sentences, someone accuses the post of being written by AI. I only take offense to that notion because my analysis and writing is far more valuable than what any AI could produce. I am putting this to the test by asking the new and exciting GPT5 model for its own estimates which will be included in my comparisons to analysts.  


# Updates to My Estimates:

Overall, there are only minimal changes to the [initial post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1m5yp45/muted_results_but_booming_guidance_nvda_q2/) a few weeks ago. In the interest of Reddit attention spans, I will only highlight the changes and new totals.  
  
**Total Revenue: $46.4B**, Up $0.25 (Gaming Increase)  
**EPS: $1.03**, Up $0.01 (Increased Revenue)  


# A New Challenger in GPT5:

[Headline Estimates from GPT5](https://preview.redd.it/y7h3eiw0cuhf1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9332c28885bdbec364be95f7efe16ecefe3d122)

I fed my previous posts to GPT5 (they're on Reddit anyway) and prompted it to come up with its own estimates. The above image shows the headline projections from GPT and its bullish estimates prompted me to ask for a segment breakdown. 

[Revenue by Segment and EPS](https://preview.redd.it/5ut7zj4ccuhf1.png?width=1562&format=png&auto=webp&s=66f3898cf08e8c71f25064cd9611a61cb05ef3c3)

GPT5 is expecting strong numbers from NVDA's Data Center Segment, while its Gaming and Prof. Visualization estimates are lower than mine. GPT5 is slightly more bullish Robo & Auto than I am.   


# The Estimates Stacked Up:

[GPT5 noted this as a fair way to represent their estimates](https://preview.redd.it/9u6xxt9wcuhf1.png?width=1756&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6270483896b29093ca5d80ac7db2f1f61adb0c3)

This is what the three estimates look like stacked against each other, and it now offers a wide range of perspectives. Analyst consensus is almost always conservative (going on 3 consecutive years of beats), so comparing my detailed analysis to a likely-sandbagged estimate is hardly fair. Since AI is supposed to take my job as an analyst, let's see how the actuals compare.  


# Positions:

Still in my 200 shares and ATM (Bit ITM now) Covered Calls, looking to manage in September or October.   


[$175 Calls at around 0.60 Delta Early August](https://preview.redd.it/4ioivgxjeuhf1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7f834007b66898571302f5691d4b081a1c1ea39d)



# TLDR:

\- My Estimates Increased Slightly to $1.03 EPS on $46.4 Billion in Revenue  
\- Leaning into AI Criticism by Introducing GPT5 as an Analyst to Compare to  
\- Three estimates range in aggressiveness (AI then Me then Analyst Consensus)  
\- Still in 200 shares and short Covered Calls that have \~0.60 Delta Each
I'm not reading all of that. Is it calls or puts? It's always calls im pretty sure https://preview.redd.it/4twhmu72quhf1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4cf12db2e8f82dee2993b115a164678f235a1c13

Positions say down then up Should I ask reddit directly for the play, or should I ask an AI that scrapes reddit? 🤔 Those calls are itm and if end of august earnings are good you can expect a gap up through your 190 breakeven, while you have to either wait for dec for your calls to be exercised, or buy em back at a massive loss.

If your cool with tying up this much capital for 12 weeks and having to buy back in in the 220's let it ride. Not sure why you chose post earnings dates. They’ll report great numbers but it goes down this time. Why? Just vibes bro I know.... Did you miss the first part of the post? 😂😂 I like the way you broke this down into sections, made it very easy to read and understand, thank you! That's because it was AI............

* Tesla Inc. has secured a Transportation Network Company rideshare license in Texas under the name **Tesla Robotaxi LLC**, joining operators such as Uber and Lyft.
* The license is mandated by a new Texas law, effective September 1, 2025, that brings autonomous-vehicle–based services under the same regulatory framework as traditional human-driven rideshares.
* This permitting follows Tesla’s June launch of an invite-only robotaxi pilot in Austin, where Model Y vehicles running Full Self-Driving software have been operating with remote oversight.
* Notably, the Texas permit’s **“Safety Driver”** field is marked **“No,”** underscoring that Tesla’s Austin robotaxi service is running **fully driverless**.
* In response, shares of Uber and Lyft dipped on the heightened competition, while Tesla’s stock rose on the prospect of a fully autonomous rideshare network.

It also pumps when sales in UK and Germany drop by 55%.

After a long while, doing options here and there. Betting on earnings and or random meme stocks from you regards, i settled on a consistent strategy to make money with options in the form of mitigating losses with 0Dte puts on spy.

I only trade between 9:30 to 11:30am maybe 1pm, and look at the magnificant 7 as indicators for where the market may head in the short term. Using puts as loss mitigation. 

Maybe I'll get hosed eventually, but I finally feel confident in the strategy. Good luck out there.

**Nebius Group N.V. (NASDAQ: NBIS) — Q2 FY 2025 Snapshot**

* **Explosive top-line growth**[**.**](https://imgur.com/a/Pzs2XqZ) Revenue jumped to **$105.1 million**, up **+625 % YoY** and **+106 % QoQ**, as demand for the company’s AI-focused cloud infrastructure surged.
* **Positive inflection in core operations.** The Nebius AI Cloud segment moved into **positive adjusted EBITDA**, narrowing the overall adjusted EBITDA loss to **-$21.0 million** versus -$58.1 million a year ago.
* **Headline GAAP profit driven by one-time gain.** A **$597 million mark-to-market gain** on equity holdings swung GAAP net income to **$502.5 million**; excluding special items, **adjusted net loss was –$91.5 million**.
* **Raised outlook.** Management lifted 2025 year-end **ARR guidance to $900 million–$1.1 billion** (previously $600 million–$800 million).
* **Scaling for AI demand.** Cap-ex more than tripled YoY to **$510.6 million** as Nebius accelerates data-center build-outs and works to secure **>1 GW of power capacity by 2026**.
* **Balance-sheet & share data.** Cash fell to **$1.68 billion** after heavy investment; 238.7 million shares outstanding (Class A + B) plus options/RSUs.
* **Street reaction.** Shares rose **≈16 % pre-market to \~$64** following the release.
* **Next events.** Earnings webcast today at **8 a.m. ET**; next scheduled report: Q3 results in late October.

**Takeaway:** Nebius is rapidly converting surging AI-infrastructure demand into triple-digit revenue growth and edging toward operating profitability. The upgraded ARR target signals confidence in continuing momentum, though cash burn and cap-ex remain elevated as the firm races to build capacity and lock in power supplies.

1mjk4xm,2025-08-06,"SRPT Stock - The Meta of 2025 🚀🚀
Ladies and Gentlemen, we all know about the rise Meta stock had since 2022 when it was trading at a PE of 9. I bring you the META of 2025, Sarepta Pharmaceuticals $SRPT which is currently trading at a PE of 2. The stock was trading at $150 last year and is currently trading at at $17.3. The reason two patient deaths in non- ambulatory patients earlier this year. The company has since stopped shipping shipments for non-ambulatory patients.

Revenue Breakdown: The company had $2.2 billion in revenue last year based on 4 approved drugs on the market. 1 billion came from 3 drugs combined. Another billion came from the 4th drug named Elevidys. From the $1.2 billion share, 80% revenue comes from ambulatory patients. Hence, even if the shipments to non-ambulatory population is halted, the company can still make around 1 billion revenue from the ambulatory population. More than 800 ambulatory patients have been dosed in past 2 years and there have been 0 deaths. The targeted patient population are young guys who have rare disease named DMD which causes patients to lose the ability to walk at 12 and confirmed death in their 20's.

Earnings on 8/6: The company announced earnings today. The free cash flow was 200 million. At this run rate, the company is trading at a Price to Earnings of 2 and Price to Sales of 0.8. Normally biotech companies have a Price to Sales of 3-4 making this stock very undervalued. Stock is up 8% 🚀after Earnings today 

FDA Drama: There was a recent death of non-ambulatory patient undergoing a Phase 1 trial (different drug than Elevidys) and the FDA commissioner Vinay Prasad asked the company to pause shipments for both ambulatory and non-ambulatory patients. The decision was reversed in 3 days and the company was allowed to continue shipping the product for ambulatory patients. This controversy got the FDA commissioner Vinay to get fired on the same day. This tells u how strong the company's lobbying and patient advocacy groups are

Position: 220k worth of share at average 16.50.

Target Price: $50+ by end of 2025

Additionally, Popular Hedge Fund De Shaw recently bought 5 million shares on 7/18 at average of $14.5. SI currently is 16.5%

I'm sold, just took out a second mortgage. Their drug doesn’t work. I’m in biotech and have a PhD in molecular biology. They skipped some of the tests needed to validate their approach. AAV for cellular therapy is risky and permanent. If they discover something better but you’ve already used AAV on a patient, you can’t go back and re-try. Generally I think it’s a garbage company with garbage technology.

So, calls I guess. God I love this sub I bought 250 shares like a month ago. Then I bought 250 more. Then I kept buying and buying, and now I’m up to 6500 shares. Way bigger position than I ever thought I’d be getting into but the opportunity just kept looking better and better.

1mjk4ot,2025-08-06,"RDDT holders - help me understand how RDDT Answers affects your investment thesis
I own 510 shares as a longterm shareholder. I am bullish on ads, and leveraging AI data, and acting as the last bastion of human generated content.... but the answers function isn't clicking for me. I used it a few times and it seems like a shoddy combination of google search (brings up reddit threads) and LLM (where an AI summarizes them poorly).

People have google and ChatGPT as the dominate incumbents for search. You go on any of those platforms and ask a question and its likely reddit threads will popup, along with other sources, giving a user a wide range of sources. And how can Reddit compete with the behemoths of Google search and LLM of ChatGPT/Gemini? If Reddit answers becomes a thing, could google/chatgpt work to reduce showing reddit results and thus lower DAU?

I also feel like users have already switched between google and chatGPT recently, and are not interested to try out a new platform of reddit search, and already get reddit results from using those two platforms.

Also, if I want to search something on reddit, I can just use the search function and look up threads myself or append reddit to my google/chatGPT searches? I feel RDDT works best as the next generation forum technology that removes the need for any forum websites ever, and their data as AI training, and where humanity will rely on as the last bastion of human generated content. Reddit Answers seems like a distraction IMHO. Leave the LLM development and searching algos to OpenAI/Google IMO?
Nobody tell him.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.* Reddit is morphing from an under-monetised forum site into a dual-engine, high-margin data & ad platform whose content is table-stakes for generative-AI—and the market still prices it like a niche social app rather than the infrastructure layer it’s becoming.

That combination of structural ad upside, royalty-like AI licensing, and a credible path to index inclusion underpins the long-term bull case.

Plus have you seen their balance sheet? It is cleaner than clean: enough money to pay all the debts in one shot and walk away, any day. My only concern with RDDT is people increasingly staying in the chatgpt area rather coming to the reddit. 


That is the bearish case though.  It doesn’t affect my thesis at all. 

Reddit is a top 10 most visited website. Top 10! That means a lot of ad revenue. It’s involved with AI. They have zero debt. They are profitable with continually improving profits. They have a passionate user base. People not investing in Reddit will unfortunately miss out on massive gains over the next several years. That’s where the Reddit magic comes in. Reddit has real words by real people posted. Chat gpt often cites Reddit and quotes threads and comments on Reddit. Imo the largest bull case is Reddit being the most trust website in the internet for non AI or non sponsored input. Until it stops being one since AI has gotten all the data it needed 


Then it doesn't need to cite reddit etc. when that happens is another thing though  dunno but someone told me the traffic stats on their subreddit was down 20% so far in Aug month over month These big AI companies are all starved of data. Meta and xAI will be able to pull from their captive datasets, but the rest will always be searching. I wouldn’t be surprised to see OpenAI purchase Reddit or something like that in the future. Reddit Answers only adds real value if it keeps users on-site long enough to serve extra ads; right now it’s just a clumsy Perplexity-style summary that most people can replicate by typing “site:reddit” on Google or ChatGPT. The edge Reddit has is trust-people believe upvoted comments more than scraped web pages-so the feature should lean on things Google can’t copy, like weighting answers by karma, flair, and recency, and surfacing follow-up threads. Watch metrics like average session length and ad load per search; if those don’t move, compute costs will drag margins. Also keep an eye on subs marking posts “no-train”; if the data well dries up the moat disappears fast. I juggle Kagi for clean search, Perplexity for quick LLM takes, and Pulse for Reddit when I need to see how different communities phrase a question, but I still end up opening [reddit.com](http://reddit.com) afterward.

1mjhm1f,2025-08-06,"Made back all my yearly losses in 3 days
Started trading stocks in the middle of January, after trying forex for years. Slow losses over and over.  Found spy options.  First day trading them, I went from around $11000 to over $40000, then closed position at around $7500.  The next day I tried again, took my $7500 to over $11000, then wound up closing position with around $4000 in account.  I really had no idea what I was doing or how the contracts would diminish in value as the day went on.
The last few weeks have been a cycle of a few good days, then blow account on a bad trade by not getting out when it went against me.  Deposit more money, rinse and repeat.
Last Friday I was down to about $700 in my account, threw another $1000 on top of it, and was able to turn that into $4600 on spy, which is where I started on Monday. 
This week I still did a few spy trades, but switched primarily to spx.  And these last 3 days have been incredible.  My account has gone from $4600>$9600>$30000>$93000 today.  
I’m sure I’ll get the usual comments about working at Wendy’s, put it on roulette, luck in a bull market, etc….and that’s cool. 
Just excited to share this incredible journey

If you are a UNH employee and your life is in danger, please call yo broker and buy more shares Healthcare spending is guaranteed to continue to rise as our older population grows.

Whether it comes from Medicaid or not, someone will be there to manage it, and UNH is in a perfect position to capitalize on it. Your risk is capped by the price you pid for the stock. if the stock goes down to $20 like Intel, you will get your 10-20-30% (capped) premium, but can also go 90% down due to the stock value. And that is a non 0% chance scenario.

It will be interesting to see what happens to UNH then So how much do you expect to make off this? You don’t think there is any other stock in the world you could have invested this same amount of money into to maximize gains? Fr fr

The only part im torn on with UNH, is this is a longer term play, I don’t expect a quick recover

and because of that- the 1 year out calls, I’m very tempted to sell, $2000 in premium on the $300 calls, either free $2000 or 30% profit

But since I expect this to be a much better then a 30% gain trade. Only shares and no covered calls, would be too sad if this does much better then 30% in a year

But it’s definitely where I’m getting torn. Would be $6000 free by selling them, and a max of 30% profit isn’t like that’s a small amount in a year…. Got a whole $800 of bull

(Not a guaranteed win imo but it’s a potential 0-100 kind of stock)

In all my years of investing the one thing I’ve never understood is if analysts come up with estimates and a company beats them but doesn’t meet the “expected” number who creates the expected number. I mean if you’re an analyst and you project .40 per share and the company beats that by 20% and the stock drops because it didn’t meet expectations whose expectations aren’t being met?  If it’s the analysts’ then why didn’t they just raise their estimates?

It’s like that old sprint commercial stickin it to the man - but you are the man. So you’re sticking it to yourself. Look back at the three month period from a stocks last earnings report. AMD went up by almost 70%, so the earnings growth has to justify the growth in share price. If amd had gone down 10% in that same time you would see a different reaction to this report.

1mho65p,2025-08-04,"RDDT YOLO
What is more regarded than yoloing on RDDT? Well, of course yoloing on 2xRDDT == RDTL. Threw $15k into RDTL right before earnings last week and added another $20k today when uptrend was confirmed.

My price target for RDDT is around 500-1000 which brings RTDL to I don't know what.

Next catalysts I'm waiting for are a test of ATH which is 230 and SP500 inclusion.

And yes, I did buy the top on AMZN, that's why it's down!
So Reddit's time spent on website is around 20 mins compared to Meta's 40 minutes (includes family of apps so including undermonetised threads/whatsapp), Reddit generates around $7ish per US user compared to Meta which is like $80?

If Reddit gets a bigger liquidity pool of advertisements, their algorithm works better for targeting and it will improve the performance for the advertisers like how it worked for Meta, Reddit is still in the very early stages of properly monetising

Can someone poke holes in my retarded DD? Good DD. Adding to this they also recently added Reddit Answers so that it functions like a search engine as well so you might as add that to the valuation. I started doing some DD on RDDT today and figured I'd highlight some pieces of information I found interesting. I've been a huge fan and user of the platform for years and have nibbled here and there on the stock. I plan on putting $100k on it this week. 



Long term, I don't see how Reddit doesn't 3-10x. Short term, strap in for some volatility. 



I believe this stock gets overlooked on the AI play and among so many other metrics. I tried looking at it as a pure social media play, and and AI play. 



Looking at some basic financials I compared RDDT to some of its social media peers. It actually lags in most financial metrics, but their user base is much larger, and has clearly not been fully monetized. I believe RDDT is just starting to make monetization a priority and I think we'll see huge strides over the next few years.

  
**RDDT (Current)**

Market Cap: $37 Billion

Monthly Users 1.2 Billion

Revenue: $1.3 Billion (FY 2024)

  
**META (Facebook IPO Numbers)**

Market Cap: $104 Billion

Monthly Users: 845 Million

Revenue: $5.08 Billion (FY 2012)

  
**TWTR (Peak)**

Market Cap: $44 Billion (Peak)

Monthly Users: 336 Million (Peak)

Revenue: $5.1 Billion (Peak)

  
As for the AI trade, currently this is actually a small portion of revenue for them. 

""As per [Adweek](https://www.adweek.com/social-marketing/ai-licensing-deals-with-google-and-openai-make-up-10-of-reddits-revenue/), between Google and OpenAI, its AI licensing deal brings in about 10% of its revenue. We know [Google paid about $60 million to Reddit](https://searchengineland.com/reddit-google-ai-content-licensing-deal-437782) for its content deal, and the only other known company to have a deal with Reddit for its content is OpenAI. That leaves OpenAI paying $70 million to Reddit for its licensing deal.""

I fully expect this to grow and the number of deals to increase in the coming months/years. While a lot of AI investment is currently being done on the hardware side, the breadth and amount of data Reddit controls is unimaginable in scale. If you need some data for your AI to consume, Reddit is a great place to start.

Reddit is currently the 6th most visited site in the world. It just overtook Wikipedia in May. The only sites above it are Google, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and ChatGPT. Same here. Been a redditor for over 10 years. Before they went public, they sent +10year users a PM with a chance to buy shares early. I followed the steps but then apparentley it was for US citizens only, which I am not. So I missed out. But finally bought a tiny bit last week too I bought some Reddit shares on Friday . I figured I would at least throw a little money to the app we all love.. lol Back in February earnings were just as good and it dropped 50% in a month I feel sentiment is different this time. CEO talking about the Google algorithm change tanked the stock. This earnings showed that it was a big nothing burger and they’re growing crazy still. You're not a moron! There is no decay if RDDT just keeps going up. It's only 35B market cap so it's an easy 3-10x from here. See u @ 230 >The idea that more ads can make advertising better was a ""contrarian view"" held by Andrew Bosworth (BOS), Meta's CTO and head of Reality Labs, during a critical period in Facebook's history, particularly as the company was shifting its focus to mobile monetization.
His reasoning, challenged initially by Mark Zuckerberg who wanted to show fewer ads due to concerns about user experience, centered on several key points:

>• Ads as Content: Bosworth argued that a great ad could be ""on par with content"" in a user's feed. This suggests that highly relevant and well-targeted ads could be as engaging and valuable to users as organic posts.

>• Liquid Marketplace for Targeting: Showing ""huge amounts more ads"" creates a ""beautiful liquid Marketplace"" with ""hundreds of thousands of advertisers"" and ""billions of users"". This vast scale means there's a greater pool of ads to choose from and a larger user base to target.

>• Data for Algorithms: To achieve ""way better targeting"" and deliver optimal ads, ""fantastic algorithms"" are needed. These algorithms can only be developed and trained effectively with ""tons and tons of data"". More ads mean more interactions and data points, which in turn feed and improve the targeting algorithms.

>• Relevance Problem: Bosworth reframed the issue of ""crappy ads"" not as an ad quantity problem, but as a ""relevance problem."" By increasing the volume of ads, the system gains more opportunities to learn and refine what is most interesting to each user, enabling the display of the ""optimal ad"" for them at any given moment.

>• Increased Engagement: The effectiveness of this approach was later demonstrated when, in some markets, turning off ads in Meta's apps surprisingly led to a decrease in user engagement, further supporting the idea that relevant ads can function as a form of engaging content.
This strategic shift, driven by Bosworth's insights, was crucial for Facebook's mobile monetization, especially given that its S1 filing for IPO explicitly stated that it did ""not currently directly generate any meaningful revenue from the use of Facebook mobile products"". By the fourth quarter of 2013, mobile advertising became the majority (53%) of Facebook's revenue, showcasing the success of this strategy.

1mha61j,2025-08-04,"$PTLO come for the earnings, stay for the value
**TLDR: $PTLO earnings Tuesday Aug 5th AM. $PTLO go up. Buy, make money.**

**My positions:**

***Shares a lot***

***options a little: Jan 2026 $15, Jan 2027 $12, August 15th $10s. Also sold some $10 CSPs in August, but that's probably a little advanced for this class***

$PTLO earnings releases on Tuesday, and I think it is set up to take off.  Ever been like *""Damn if only I bought $wing, $cava, $cmg early"".* Well guess what, HERE YOU GO.

What is Portillos? Chicagoland fast casual that serves, burgers, Chicago style hot dogs, polish sausage, italian beefs, chocolate cake shake, etc. IPO'd late 2021 and bagged a bunch of people (like literally every IPO of the time). Since IPO has been focusing on expansion outside of Chicagoland

# Bull Notes (in no particular order)

* Activist investor group Engaged Capital took \~10% position late last year and been working with $PTLO to quality candidates to the board and optimize expansion and restaurants. There most relevant and impressive work is with Shake Shack

https://preview.redd.it/835ezbs5hzgf1.png?width=1439&format=png&auto=webp&s=41af3ea19c6cf6149e7879581a480b93974f31cd

* Jack Hartung was added to the board this year. He was CFO of Chipotle for 22 years and is current president. Has Chipotle fallen off in recent years, yes. But what we care about is he was apart of the EXPLOSIVE GROWTH of Chipotle since pre 2006 IPO. He is also on the board of $TSLA, which is cool, i guess (Portillo's Tesla diner anyone?) Pre chipotle he did 18 years for Mcdonalds Corp. Guy is solid
* Most recently, Eugene Lee was added to the board in June. CEO of Darden Restaurants from 2015-2022. Darden has some big name restaurants in their portfolio, so another star player to the leadership team that can guide Portillo's along the growth journey

https://preview.redd.it/yblypmfchzgf1.png?width=1240&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd5f4aece1ba9ec6ffcbfbaddc5f9ecb4e4eedaf

* AUV (monies per restaurant) for Portillo's is crazy high $8.7 million per restaurant in 2025 (dragged down a bit by newer operations that aren't up to snuff yet). A chipotle does like 3 million, a texas road house does like 7 million. The only comparable I can find is Chik-fil-le which restaurants can do over $9 million. You should go buy there stock, o wait you cant.
* Total restaurants 94 at end off Q1. Restaurants were going loaded on the back half of the year. 1 Q2, 5-6 Q3, and 5-6 Q4. It'll be good to hear how that's progressing. My guess would be like 3-4ish by the time of the call. There goal is to get scale up to 12-15% per year and almost 10x restaurants to over 900 locations
* Breakfast. Experimenting with it, Already expanded locations from the initial 5 so thats promising. I've tried it, its delicious. Hope to hear some numbers. Mega bull example is McDonald's whose revenue from breakfast is like 25%. Maybe we could hope for a +10% revenue to start at full roll out (if its determined to make permanent and would likely only be chicagoland to start).  Would like to hear some numbers on the call
* PE current low 20s trading like its not a growth stock.

# Bear Notes

* Big sell off -10%  day, recently. Chipotle earnings caused a massive selloff in all restaurant stocks due to bad same store sales. I think its bullshit. Proof go look at $cake and $wing earnings last week. Turns its a chipotle problem not an industry problem. I guess sales go down when you charge more, give out less food, and treat customers like shit. This followed by general market tanking last week. This all to say its not PTLOs fault, its the market that's wrong!
* Daddy Powell cucking trump and won't cut rates. Yes generally small caps benefit from lower rates. They'd help PTLO thrive, but are not needed to survive and continue growing at a steady pace. Since jobs data got ""fixed"", maybe that changes sooner than later
* New restaurants performance. Growing pains IMO. Likely takes 1-2 years to reach maturity
* Poor stock performance. I call it opportunity.
* Cattle futures are to the moon. Think they've done pretty good keeping price up to offsets costs. Can they keep doing it?

Doesn't this chart look like shit? To the habitual top blaster sure. My personal strategy involves buying low and selling higher than that (not for everyone I know). Also a guy a X posted about this Wackoff guy and 2025 sure looks like Jackoffs CuMulation. If u google institutional ownership it is a whopping 97%. Smart money been stock piling to sell later to u chasers. Front run it for once in your life. Big SEXY volume rising into earnings. You know what moves tickers VOLUME.

You know how I know this shit can go? Cuz I already round tripped some shares this year. Lows under $8 to just under $16 and back where we are today. It was lonely at the top. I want to bring friends with me this time.

I regret nothing. I'm holding shares long enough to be marked long and pay as little taxes as possible like a true patriot. Besides just cuz I round tripped it doesn't mean I didn't pick up any souvenirs.

1mh0i7h,2025-08-04,"LUNR [DD] - Intuitive Machines Bull Case
***General Background***:

Everyone who has read into this company knows that they had 'failed' IM-1 and IM-2 missions; however, in the eyes of people in the aerospace industry these are not true failures.

**IM-1** (Feb 22, 2024) was the **first U.S. soft landing since Apollo**; it touched down, tipped, but returned data.

**IM-2** (Mar 6, 2025) also reached the surface (**south-polar region, Mons Mouton**), but tipped inside a crater; it operated \~12–13 hours before power/thermal limits ended the mission, and still returned important data and tested novel systems (unlike competitors like Firefly).

Firefly’s Blue Ghost landed on the near side and ran >14 days, right before IM-2 'failed', which fueled even more negative sentiment toward LUNR. But IM-2 attempted a harder polar profile (low sun angles, deep shadows, rough terrain). Intuitive's next mission, IM-3, will target a near-side site, more like Firefly’s profile and *much more likely* to be successful.

IM leads the Moon RACER team with a $30M Phase-1 feasibility award (Apr 2024). NASA will pick one provider for a demo mission, then issue operations task orders under an IDIQ (ceiling up to $4.6B) through 2039. A Phase-2 win would create multi-year, recurring service revenue tied to Artemis surface ops.

LUNR also is working on an orbital transfer vehicle, a $9.8M Phase Two government contract through CDR positions IM for in-space mobility work beyond landers.

NASA selected Intuitive Machines for a potential 10-year, maximum of $4.82B IDIQ to provide lunar communications/navigation services core infrastructure for Artemis and commercial users. Early NSNS task orders are already funded; and relay-service revenue begins after the IM-3 satellite is accepted into operations.



***Catalysts:***

**Earnings (Aug 7th)**: Could announce new contract updates. Watch for information on their backlog.

**IM-3**: Reiner Gamma (near-side, well-lit, relatively benign terrain) carrying NASA’s Lunar Vertex suite and CADRE multi-rover tech demo. A successful 14-day surface campaign would materially de-risk Nova-C and validate service pricing. This is an easier mission and much more likely to be successful than IM-1 or IM-2. Will launch no earlier than Dec 2025. **IN ADDITION** \- IM-3 will release the first NSNS lunar data-relay satellite into lunar orbit, which will allow task orders from NASA to be filled, generating more revenue for Intuitive Machines.

**IM-4**: \~2027 Mons Mouton (again), lunar south pole... Carrying 2 more aforementioned satellites.

***Risks***:

**Execution**: IM-3 is somewhat of a breaking point after two tip overs.

**Contract Structure**: NSN/LTVS are IDIQ (Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity) ceilings, not guaranteed revenue.

**Competition**: Firefly, Astrobotic, Lockheed-led teams for Commercial Lunar Payload Services/Near Space Network/Lunar Terrain Vehicle.



***Quick Financials:***

Revenue: $62.5M (up 14% q/q).

Gross margin: 11% ($6.7M).

Operating loss: $10.1M.

Cash & equivalents: $373.3M at quarter-end (post warrant redemption).

Free cash flow: +$13.3M (operating cash $19.4M minus $6.1M capex).

Backlog: $272.3M (down from $328.3M Dec-24 due to work performed).

Outlook: FY25 revenue $250–$300M; run-rate positive adj. EBITDA by YE25, positive adj. EBITDA in 2026.



**My Position**:

[My LUNR Shares.](https://preview.redd.it/gmaqbjbmowgf1.png?width=1813&format=png&auto=webp&s=049f6efc5bb94beff827c6d53503006847e607c9)

Had shares of LUNR since before IM-2, likely not selling until after IM-3.

*\*\*Repost; forgot to add my position the first time around.*



**TL;DR**: LUNR has meaningful contract runway (NSNS up to $4.82B, LTVS up to $4.6B, etc.) and cash. IM-2’s 'failure' didn't change that. In addition, if IM-3 sticks a clean near-side campaign and deploys the first NSNS relay satellite, it could result in a shift towards higher-margin services and could unlock more task orders.

I think we could easily see $20 per share again if IM-3 works out, and even higher with solid NSNS service orders and an LTVS Phase-2 win, thoughts?
Tl;Dr: the third time they will land upright Check subreddit name #TLDR

---

Ticker: LUNR

Direction: Up

Prognosis: Previous ""failed"" moon landings were actually partial successes. The upcoming IM-3 mission is in a much easier location and a clean landing is highly likely. This would de-risk the company, unlock new revenue streams from huge NASA contracts, and could send the stock to $20+.

Key Catalyst: Don't tip over the spaceship this time (IM-3, Dec 2025). Ok now I just got way too stoned and I'm sitting here like, ""isn't it crazy mannn that like, we can just bet on which rocket is gonna land best on the moon?"" Third time's a charm I like LUNR and has been looking forward to jump in. But earning is the game changer and totally un predictable. I will wait for earnings to happen and take action accordingly. Everytime they are about to launch we have the same bull case then it lands sideways and it tanks , but third times the charm? lol basically everything but change the stupid leg design they have. You take 1 look at the lander and see why it fell over. Retsrds They did not fail the same way twice, IM-1’s landing issue stemmed from laser rangefinders left safed, forcing a last-minute switch to NASA’s Navigation Doppler Lidar; it still touched down softly but tipped over. IM-2 fell on its side for different reasons: laser altimeter interference plus low-angle polar lighting/terrain degrading hazard sensing.  Result was essentially the same, but very different causes.

NASA and Intuitive Machines publicly called IM-1 an “unqualified success” because it achieved a soft landing and returned data, even though it tipped and a leg broke after a faster-than-planned touchdown.  Spaceflight missions can be successes or partial successes when primary objectives are met.  I'm not trying to sugar coat the fact that they didn't land successfully, but other parts of the mission were successes.

I addressed the IDIQ in the risks section, they only pay via funded task orders; the ceiling isn’t guaranteed. But in this case, task orders already exist and are funded: NASA announced multiple Near Space Network Services (NSNS) task orders to Intuitive Machines (DTE and relay categories), and the company reported executing the first NSNS milestones in Q1 with another $18M funded for subsequent milestones in Q2.

No, I am not in the aerospace industry.  That doesn't mean I'm not an engineer and cant understand the nuances of mission success criteria.

Again, I'm not saying things couldn't have gone better on IM-1 and IM-2, that's obvious.  But I am saying IM-3 is very likely to be successful, LUNR has a significant backlog, and it has the potential to shift from one-off delivery revenue to higher-margin, recurring services once the IM-3 NSNS relay satellite is commissioned.

3. Meeting or even slightly beating earnings will squeeze the shorts’ balls blue. OPEN had a short interest of 20.73%, look what happened when it squeezed.
4. Massive expected INCREASE in AI spend. Ex: Recent Google earnings announced increase to $85 billion. X (Grok) working to launch millions of GPUs and shipping a “power plant” from Europe to power it. Every AI player (MSFT, META, AMZN, Open AI etc) will do the same increasing spend to the 70-90bill range. TSMC also reported great earnings. Clear sign demand is accelerating not slowing.
5. International expansion - SMCI won a Major Exclusive $20 billion DataVolt (Saudi Arabia) deal, Ericsson.
6. Raised 2.3 billion cash and sold 1.79 billion in receivables for expansion. Big-brain move at 0% interest with capped calls. They are currently generating cash and not burning it, which means the money is primarily for planned massive growth and expansion.
7. BofA Analist Ruplu Bhattacharya, has a $35 price target on SMCI, but had a price target of $1,090 at one point, which is a ridiculous joke. Big funds probably have major short positions and are now caught with their pants down and are using their Analist to beat prices down. They don’t know computers. If SMCI reports spectacular earnings on 8/5/2025, and their tits get squeezed, she’ll be relegated to OnlyFans.
You and the rest of WSB are bullish on their earnings so I hope you like ramen >I know finance and this is no longer a problem.

Down about 80k total at the bottom after being up almost 75k. It happened really fast playing short dated SPY options. Took a break after losing everything, mentally regrouped, told myself “you’ll never get it back if you don’t get back in the game”.  
Put 10k more in my account, immediately lost 5k of it then slowly grinded up to 14k mostly on RDDT calls leading up to earnings. Then, over just 2 days on this past Thursday and Friday I went hard on SPY puts (Mostly 1DTE) at the perfect time. Went from just under 14k to 86k by Friday morning. 
It doesn’t feel real yet. I got a get out of jail free card.

Sweet baby Jesus. 

We got tea leaves McGee over here folks! This might be true, but I wouldn’t agree about the technical basis aspect. Technical aren’t very important right now because the company has some major fundamental issues related to the investigation, but more importantly, the government changing policy and reducing the blank check and allowable administrative margin in healthcare payments $UNH

Stephen Hemsley the CEO of $UNH watching the stock drop right now ... People forget that he was once a CFO and knows the value of strategic repurchases.

Step 1. Kitchen sink the quarter with super conservative Guidance...

Step 2. BUY BACK ALOT OF SHARES after market drops...

-> Currently Authorized to buy back 20M (7-8M were bought in Q2)

They're sitting in 32B in CASH... and still cash flowing at 16B per year right now, with cashflow increasing next year on margin recovery. 

With M&A window closed because of anti-trust... what do you think they'll do with the excess cash and shares trading at Covid lows?

20M shares @ 250/share = 5B... They were running 3B per Quarter before this earnings. Its likely they might use up the program and do another 5B next quarter... 

@ $8.80 / in div -> reducing the float by 20M -> saves 176M per year in DIV payments. 

With margin recovery next year and float thats projected to drop to 850M by year end of 2026... 

Even at 4% net income Margin (historically low) on $475B -> 19B in Net income. At 850M shares -> ~$22/share in EPS for 2026. 

at 4.5% net income Margin (historically low) on $500B -> 22.5B @ 815M shares (12B in repurchases) -> ~27/share in EPS for 2027.

EPS jump from 2025 ($16/share) to 2027($27/share)

Every share repurchased now saves on future cash to dividend and disproportionately boosts EPS.

With an investment grade credit rating and very few near term maturities... they could increase the leverage if need be.

Welcome to the club my man! Hang in there! Luigi sends his regards It feels like every other post is about someone buying UNH this week. This sub has an obsession with buying stocks in clear downtrends bc once upon a time they were expensive.

They were doing the same thing with Intel last year. It's the old ""it used to cost a lot so it should cost spot fallacy"".

This stock has so much going against it. Politically the adminstration hates the company. They just missed earnings, twice in a row for the first time in like, seven years.

When stocks sell off 50% in a couple weeks, there's a reason.They just fired the CEO. These are not signs of a company that is going to do well anytime soon. On Tuesday they came out and said they were suspending guidance for 2025. Why the hell would they do that if this company is about to blow the lid off the next quarter.

The stock traded like a tech stock, and never should have. It's going to 200 which will be a proper valuation for a *healthcare* company with deep financial troubles. !remindMe 01/2027

Had been losing for past few days on SPY 0DTEs and NVO calls (don't catch the actual falling knife), so this is a nice change of scenery! 

Saw OKLO down to 68s yesterday after open, hence bought a few 0DTE calls and held all the way till 74 before momentum faded. Solid gains maybe partly from short squeeze too, and then saw that several other stocks had similar movements as well during that timeframe.

Good luck to everyone on the upcoming week! Can only hope to sustain some of the momentum. LFG!


Solid play. Recognized the momentum early and timed the exit well. Not chasing, just executing. Squeeze deez nuts you fuckin nerd.

Basically, did this twice just playing and well . . . But yeah held too long Let me guess, you held and lost? Done it, possibly hundreds of times. Eventually you learn. But still, some times if you let emotion sneak it you will do it again. That's the play. Either 1000% or 0%. Nothing between. 


It's just $40 tho. You're good.  Always take profits cheers Done that a few times lol and still didn’t sell im what you call a “dumbass”. Good thing it was only $8 I was planning to do a $1.2k play but stopped myself. Yuhhh lf my ass wasn’t a dumbass I’d probably retire by now

NVDL was good to me. Of course I could have bought at 27 instead of 50 but whaddayagunnado.

I closed the position just before market close yesterday just to watch it jump another 5% because of course it did. But I am happy to pocket 70% gain.

Vasg in some winners or you might be chasing the dragon forever down into the toilet.

I might jump back into this one if NVDA goes down a bit and creates a new opportunity.
How did it feel holding that through april? Wasn't super comfy but I kept reminding myself that Ai spending is still increasing and that Nvidia would be selling the Lion's share of that so it had to go back up. There wasn't really a good bear case against the company and arguably there still isn't.

1me28yi,2025-07-31,"🚀🚀 Why you should buy Unlimited New Heights (UNH) 🚀🚀
Ready to take your money to unlimited new heights? It’s time to buy UNH. 

The noise of medical costs eating profits from premium? Overhyped. 

Source: I work in the industry, and UNH doesn’t NEED to make profits from premiums to succeed. Think of premiums beating the amount you pay in medical costs for inforce policies as the cherry on top.

What should be focused on is gaining more policyholders and revenue growth (succeeded at). Why?

Because UNH isn’t in the medical industry, it’s in the banking industry. 

As an example, let’s say person A has total premiums of 1000 paid to UNH throughout the year. At year end, person A has erectile dysfunction and needs immediate assistance, and is covered for a doctor visit that cost UNH $1000. 

Sure- UNH didn’t make any money directly but they just got an interest free loan of $1000 to buy SPY calls. 

Position? Ass up, face down. 
133 shares @ 283, 100% of my portfolio 


do they make high end GPU's? If you like UNH @ 283, you'll like it better at 256, BUY THE FALLING KNIFE.

EDIT: 252 and still falling YOLOing my kid’s college fund into UNH rn. If it goes to zero, at least he’ll learn character. United NVIDIA Huang Can’t they donate $50M to Turmp and make the case disappear? Seems like a no brainer Federal investigation is just getting started. This is not the correct time for buying calls. Paid UNH $4k last year, used $300. They flipped the rest into SPY calls.

1me1vgr,2025-07-31,"$SNAP: Sneaky (undervalued) Agentic AI Player
SNAP is being valued like a struggling social media app, which it is. More importantly, as the last true social network it is a uniquely valuable dataset and data collection platform for the agentic AI era. 

**The Agentic AI Era**

""A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts. So, he loses touch with reality and lives in a world of illusions.""

-Alan Watts

LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) at this point have essentially solved language. After advances in model training approaches and hardware, this was a lot easier to do than expected, largely due to the vast and varied amount of digitized written text on the internet. 

While these products are already revolutionizing certain professions, the industry and investors are already looking to the next thing. There’s a couple ideas on the horizon. One is superintelligence (aka, Meta), turbocharged LLMs that are smarter than humans. The other is agentic functioning, AI that is designed to do things. Here, superintelligence is not as critical, performance is tied to social functioning as they interface with systems designed for people. 

Agentic AI can mean a few things and to varying degrees of complexity. Nearest to basic LLM, quasi-machine friendly systems, an AI agent may call your doctor's office for you and schedule an appointment with your receptionist. In more advanced but still mostly text-based forms, an AI agent may manage your calendar, negotiate simple purchases, or coordinate services with other AIs on your behalf. The larger stride in agentic AI is past digital and text based medium, into handling decision making on your behalf in real world contexts- think interacting with household objects, interpreting social signals, threat detection and protection.  This is the area of humanoid robotics, currently receiving massive investments from Telsa, and an inevitable target for the rest of the big tech players. 

Like with LLMs- sounds hard until it's not. The technical breakthrough will hinge in sourcing and leveraging ideal datasets. Tesla is currently training their Optimus robots on data streams like YouTube videos, but in terms of acting and behaving like humans, there is a non-public, unparalleled training dataset available. This is a dataset that will make humanoid robotic devices that need to be socially aware, navigate the world in context of social cues, and build trust relationships with owners. To be clear, it a critical piece to an LLM-sized breakthrough, and perhaps greater, in agentic AI. 

And unlike superintelligence (the nerdy kid who has read about how to be cool in books), performant agentic AI will be more impactful than superintelligence in the same manner as Chad, who has failed up his whole life due to his social prowess. 

**The Slow Death of the Social Network**

Before we look more in depth at SNAP, let's check in on the ""social media"" landscape. A social network is a platform where people who know each other use technology to improve or enhance their peer-to-peer or community engagements. Here's why they largely do not exist anymore:
 
Facebook: Ad delivery system for youths with little / no natural actual real world social dynamics present. Maybe still something of a social network for boomers, but boomers Facebook experience is also fairly corrupted by AI / brainrot content that they can’t distinguish from reality.

Tiktok/instagram: endless scroll, optimized for large content creators, little to organic peer to peer social aspects, not for people who know each other to talk with each other. 

Reddit: terminally online autists exchange asynchronous messages largely around upvote farming and out-cringing each other. 

Snap: The only at-scale platform where people still communicate directly with people they actually know. Core experience still chat, video, voice, maps, streaks (read small, high-frequency, high-context exchanges). True to what social networks were originally envisioned as, it’s a high-resolution behavioral mirror of human life, especially among younger generations, and still dominated by exchanges between socially adept individuals who have non-online relationships.
 
**Commercializing the Social SNAPshot**

It is speculative, yet perhaps unavoidable, that the largely undiluted true social network of SNAP will be discovered/reframed as a undervalued training dataset / continuous data collection platform for humanoid robotics training data. 

SNAP's dataset is ideal for training large, transformer architecture which are natively tolerant of multimedia inputs. Life is a multimedia experience: spoken word, visual expressions and reactions, and written communications all blend and associated within the rich relationships captured within the platform. Tapping into these data streams, and the complex social graphs, allow training data to essentially capture not just the multimedia experience of being human, but even the cadence. A popular concept in Jazz is that brilliance lies in the rests between played notes: similarly, in true relationships, the timing between responses, and the media inputs which dictate the cadence of responses, is likely hugely influencing in teaching human like machines not just how, but when, to respond, which will have a huge bearing on social aptitude of these systems. Think of the feelings you would have towards a system that is programmed to reach out 24 hours after not hearing from you, versus one that knows to reach out at the right time to connect with you, comfort you, or even challenge you. Combine the rich multimedia experience and temporal component, multiply it across a web of remarkably lifelike social exchanges, and you arrive at something singular: the closest thing we have to a behavioral training ground for humanlike machines.

If we can accept the value of what SNAP is sitting on, let's discuss the moat. An important aspect of this dataset is that it is not publicly discoverable, which should help for monetization. Reddit’s stock price inflated massively when the market began to price in its value for AI training, however, Reddit’s training dataset is largely exposed to the internet making it easy to steal, which hampers pricing and put them a step behind in monetizing this. SNAP can control access, and therefore pricing, from an earlier stage, potentially making their dataset proportionally more valuable than companies where their training dataset is on display to the world like Reddit or LinkedIn. 

Could a larger player simply stand up a true social network to tap these human dynamics? My thesis is that they could not. Social media worked prior to our knowledge of what they were and what they would become. Given the slow bleed of true social behaviors on these platforms, and the immense value they have produced (extracted) from the social landscape, newcomers are met with skepticism and an almost repulsion from most people. SNAP has two important qualities that provide a huge amount of inertia and competitive advantage: it was early enough to establish credibility before the public grew wary of social platforms, and it's popular with youth - a group that’s still highly social, less curated in their expression, and embedded in environments like school where dense social graphs naturally form. 

The ship may have sailed to create another SNAP: what SNAP has in the last true social network, may not just be valuable, but foundational. SNAP is not likely the company to build the devices, nor would need to train the models, but with the right acquisition or partnerships, they can play the kingmaker in agentic AI training. 

**Who's going to tell SNAP? Risks to the thesis**

\- Delayed Agentic AI Era

* The necessary hardware for embodied AI and humanoid robotics may take longer to mature.
* If that happens, the window to monetize SNAP’s dataset may arrive too late for the company to benefit or even survive.
* However, SNAP still appears undervalued on fundamentals alone: revenue is growing, debt is declining, valuation remains at the low end of social media peers

\- SNAP Fails to Realize Its Own Value

Snap may never recognize the strategic importance of its dataset to agentic AI. If so, it risks:

* Shifting toward META-style algorithmic feed optimization, which could erode the organic human interaction that makes its data valuable (already, arguably, in progress)
* Overcommitting to hardware wearables, which may enrich data types but not outweigh the diversion in focus from platform-level AI opportunity
* Undervaluing its data in licensing or partnership deals due to lack of awareness

\- Execution Risk

* Successfully transitioning from a consumer social platform to a data infrastructure or licensing company requires different leadership, strategic vision, and monetization models.
* SNAP may not be equipped to make that leap on its own.

Even if SNAP can't figure it out on their own, the market will likely step in on its behalf. As the agentic AI revolution takes shape and hyperscalers hit walls trying to model social nuance, SNAP’s position as a uniquely rich behavioral dataset will become increasingly difficult to ignore. And of course, if SNAP figures this out, they can optimize their platform to maximize data retention, cohesion, and social modeling to best prepare for the agentic AI opportunity. 

**The play**

I am in for 25k in shares, and planning to keep adding to the position. I might consider an exit if the forward looking impression of SNAP changes to account for these ideas and generate a quick 10x, otherwise I let it ride as the agentic AI era takes off. 

blah blah not financial advice.

Sold these and a couple other strikes unsecured back in May because I wanted exposure but also some dividend income while i'm going to school in japan.  Seeing as we are up to $238 over night and based on meta and Microsoft earnings AMZN is probably also going to smash it.  Honestly not sure the best way to adjust this position.  I knew we would get to a new ATH but wasn't expecting it this fast.  I'm tempted to roll them up to $260 strikes or maybe with the extra buying power sell more $240s?
I think it will slide at some point, but it's hot now, and will probably be up at the end of year...so I'd be careful about end of summer or early next year dates. The ""I need dividend income for school in Japan so I'll sell unsecured puts"" strategy is my new favorite. A true scholar.

Honestly, being up almost $5,500 is a good problem to have. If you think AMZN is going to keep running, rolling up to the $260 strike is just collecting more of that sweet, sweet ""dividend"" premium.

1mdf1wf,2025-07-30,"DD on $SNAP…The Path to Breaking $11 in the Coming Weeks
Hey everyone,
Alright, let's talk about a name that many have written off: Snap Inc. ($SNAP). I know it's been a volatile and often frustrating stock to own, but I've been watching the price action and the recent news closely, and I believe we're seeing the setup for a potential breakout above the $11 mark in the next few weeks.
Here's my bull thesis, broken down into a few key points.
1. The Technical Picture is Improving
From a technical analysis (TA) perspective, $SNAP is starting to look constructive.
 * Consolidation Base: The stock has been carving out a solid base in the $9.30-$9.40 range for a while now. This period of consolidation after a downtrend can often precede a move higher.
 * Psychological Barrier at $10: The $10 level is a huge psychological hurdle. We've seen the stock test it, get rejected, and then reclaim it. A sustained hold above $10 would be very bullish and could attract momentum traders.
 * Next Resistance: If we hold above $10, the next logical area of resistance on the chart is right around $11-$11.25. Given the right catalyst, a push to test this level seems highly probable.
2. The Amazon Catalyst is Under-appreciated
The partnership allowing users to buy products from Amazon directly through Snapchat ads is a game-changer, in my opinion.
 * Closing the Loop: This move directly addresses a major weakness for $SNAP: ad attribution and return on investment (ROI). It makes it much easier for advertisers to see a direct conversion from an ad view to a sale.
 * Higher Ad Value: As the ROI becomes clearer and more potent, Snap can command higher prices for its ad inventory. This is a direct tailwind for Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), a key metric. The formula for revenue is essentially DAU \times ARPU. While Daily Active Users (DAU) growth is modest, boosting ARPU is the fastest way to grow the top line.
3. Snapchat+ is a Silent Success Story
Snapchat's subscription service, Snapchat+, is quietly building a significant, high-margin revenue stream. They recently surpassed 5 million subscribers. While this isn't a massive number on its own, it proves two things:
 * A core group of users is willing to pay for enhanced features.
 * It diversifies revenue away from being 100% reliant on advertising, which is crucial in a tough macroeconomic environment.
4. Sentiment is Still Overwhelmingly Negative
Let's be honest, the market hates this stock. It's been beaten down for so long that any piece of good news is met with skepticism. This is exactly the kind of environment where a sentiment reversal can cause an aggressive rally. The stock is far from its all-time highs, and a short-term re-rating doesn't seem out of the question as the business fundamentals slowly improve.
Risks to Consider:
 * Competition: TikTok is a monster, and Meta's Reels are always a threat. Snap needs to continue innovating to keep its user base engaged.
 * Macro Headwinds: Ad spending is highly cyclical. If we enter a significant economic downturn, $SNAP's ad revenue will take a hit, regardless of their new features.
 * Execution: Management has to deliver. Any missteps on an earnings call or bad guidance could send the stock spiraling back down.
Conclusion / TL;DR:
The combination of a constructive technical chart, a powerful and under-hyped catalyst with the Amazon partnership, and growing high-margin subscription revenue makes a compelling case for $SNAP. With the stock building support above the key $10 level, I believe it has the momentum to test and break through $11 in the coming weeks.
Positions: Long 985 shares of $SNAP.

https://preview.redd.it/u5561mkzfzff1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=775209d3fd34729207bfc89c54bbb2a52bf399af

# Analysis

I took values for each drug, accounted for the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC), ELTP's market penetration and worked out a revenue stream for each. Then I allotted value for other variables - time to complete a patentable technology (SequestOx), market shares increasing to the level that the sales department has reached for other drugs etc. to get a range of values. I tried to be conservative in my approach to give a range I feel will be seen in a buyout scenario or exceeded in a buyout scenario.

I've purchased and sold companies, I analyze properties and portfolios of real estate, I have provided valuations for syndications, and I've been hired as a consultant to provide an estimate of the future value of projects. This by NO means, makes me an expert, nor am I saying this means you need to rely on my advice. I am simply sharing my experience and giving you all some insight to how I got about these things. I'm sure we all do this to an extent, but, we are only able to use the tools we have seen others use sometimes, so hopefully this is valuable information for you.

So, based on above, I see it very reasonable to expect a buyout in the range of $2.67 to $4.57 per share or higher. That's a 5x to 9x opportunity. Now, let's say you hate me or my methodology. Fair enough. How wrong do you think I am? 10% - fair enough - that's a negotiating range. But a negotiating range goes down AND up. 20% off? Possibly. 30% off? 40% because you think I'm a level 10 regard?

Even if you cut this by 50% it's still a 2.45x to 4.5x value from today.

# Upcoming Catalysts

The Q1 earnings call is coming up around Aug 15th, and, if you recall, I made two guarantees last time I posted about ELTP. One, that it would be a record breaking annual revenue on the July year end earnings call - which I was correct on. Two, that this Q1 would be record breaking revs YOY. If I'm wrong on either, I will accept a ban from this board is what my guarantee was and I'm halfway there.

The last earnings call said that ELTP is almost to phase 2 of what they estimate to be a 3 phase strategy to sell the company. They said the investment bank would be chosen in the next three to four months, so it could be announced at any time.

You may or may not recall a post I did about ELTP's first time having a large investment fund purchasing shares a few months ago. That company was called Ancor Holdings, and here is a reminder of why that is a very intriguing detail. ELTP has NEVER had a large investment company (they have $10 billion under management) buy shares, to my knowledge, and I've researched this company for the last eight years. It was a TINY amount of shares, but my theory is that it was a legal maneuver. By disclosing that they had purchased shares, it removed any claim that there was any insider information that induced them to buy. If I'm right, it's a super smart play and allows them another 90 days to accumulate shares essentially under the radar if they are trying to amass a respectable position without driving the price up. Let's say they wanted to accumulate 5% of the company - the next reporting date for their total shares is August 15th as well, coincidentally. The number of TRADING days between their last report and August 15th? **69 days**. Coincidence? I think not, good sirs.

Lastly, on Friday, the company had the first insider buy that I've seen in the last 8 years at least - maybe longer. Now, who do you want to see buy? Who knows info first? The CEO? CFO? Nope - the Chief Marketing Officer. Mr. Kirko Kirkov himself. Jesus holds the honor of turning water into wine, but Mr. Kirkov is turning pennies in to dollars with the unbelievable job he did building this sales department. And, that's right, the man who KNOWS the revenue before the report even gets sent to the CFO, to get sent to the CEO is the man who bought shares in the company at a strike price of around 58 cents. This guy isn't looking to make 10% on his money. He's not looking to make 20%. I think he knows a deep value when he sees one and thinks this thing is going to explode.

# Summary

The TLDR is I shared my approach to valuing this company and my personal estimate I'm using as a conservative approach is $2.67 to $4.57 as a range but with upside potentially higher, especially if a foreign company needs to buy us to protect from tariff costs and wants to produce locally in the US.

One last random tidbit - Friday had an interesting mention of ELTP in Zack's - an investment website with a good amount of readers. ELTP was named alongside Caterpillar and Charles Schwab - impressive and will likely lead to investors who usually only look at large blue chips to at least be on their radar. That could bring in some new investors over this week.

We can be thinking about 5 different things competently while neurotypical people usually only have a one track focus mind is the best way to describe it. Neurodivergent simply means your brain is wired differently so it's like an umbrella term. People with autism are good at pattern recognition and read people very easily due to being ostracized in childhood so you spent most of it observing people. Not all people have above average IQs but chances increase because you're able to laser focus your attention on things you're passionate about. I love learning so I spent more time in college on wikipedia and youtube lol.

We are very good at spotting others who have it. The giveaway was you overly explaining your thinking. They used to label us high functioning autism but I think there's a new term used now. It's a spectrum so we got  lucky lol.

1mz2ehp,2025-08-24,"Built a ~$6k portfolio for my girlfriend, would love feedback
Hey guys,

I’ve been learning about the stock market over the past month lots of reading and research. I’ve done alright so far, but let’s be real: it’s a bull market, so anyone can feel like they’re good.

My girlfriend handed me \~$6k of extra money that she wants invested, and this is the portfolio I built for her (screenshot attached).

The general idea is:

* **Long-term growth** through broad ETFs (VEQT, VGRO, VSP, XIU).
* **A bit of safety** with balanced funds like VBAL, in case she ever needs to liquidate some in the near future.
* **Some higher variance bets** in individual stocks (NEGG, HOOD, CRWD, NVDA) where we hope to catch more upside. (She is fine with the volatility seeing some quick wins even on tiny pieces could be fun)
* Plus small positions in things like KTOS, IBM, UBER, and a slice of BTCC for Bitcoin exposure.

Would love advice/criticism on the allocation.

* Does this look too scattered?
* Is there anything I should trim or consolidate?
* For a \~$6k starter portfolio, does this approach make sense or should I simplify it more?

Any input is welcome. But keep in mind that that is just the first iteration, I haven't bought the stocks yet and I wont until I'm sure I have a portfolio that makes sense and is well thought out.

[https://imgur.com/a/WBQsjov](https://imgur.com/a/WBQsjov)
Imo way to scattered.
Buy a SPY ETF or global equity for stocks.
Bonds/MMF for liquidity if necessary (honestly with 6k what's the point? Just go 100% risk on)
5% BTC is enough for exposure.
If you really want 10x bets then put 10% for that, since the total capital is small I wouldn't pick more than 2 stocks. Wait, you own all three of VEQT, VBAL, and VGRO?? And then also XIU?

I don’t say this to be mean but you have no idea what you are doing. Yet.

Question 1 is what is the time horizon. Is this money that can be left alone for a while?

Question 2 is risk tolerance, although if she gave the money to you it’s clearly pretty high.

I would go 100% VEQT if the money can be left to grow. If this was a troll, nice job, you got me. Unless she's planning to get properly into investing, this is way too much for a first timer to keep track of. 


Pick like 5 total. 2 ETFs that are easy to understand. 1 for safety bonds/gold/etc. 2 individual higher risk and reward NVDA, BTCC, UBER, etc. 


If you're just managing her money entirely for her and mirroring a larger account so it stays in account before it becomes married 'family' money that you'll continue to manage... This might make sense but it's way to much for someone just learning the basics.  I really hate it. 

A lot of these stocks are heavily correlated and in a risk off environment you'll get obliterated. They aren't even particularly great stocks with huge upside potential. 

Life pro tip, don't manage your girlfriend's portfolio. You aren't married. If you lose half of her money, it's gonna be a bad time. I'd have her open a Roth IRA, throw the money into it, and buy a broad market index fund or have a free financial advisor help her pick a fund/ETF. If this is an emergency fund (or she doesn't have one), then I'd move this into a money market instead of an IRA. Too complicated, a lot of overlapping exposures, and uncompensated risk.

I would simplify and reduce the number of holdings, something like VT (a World market cap equity fund) being the core holding is a good starting place. In long term investing the boring stuff is actually the most reliable strategy VOO and chill bro Your broad portfolio seems to be diminishing returns, and your satellite portfolio lacks asymmetric upside. Betting on overheated large caps? Would much rather take that satellite portfolio and bet on undervalued small-mid caps. I'm not even familiar with these ETFs VEQT, VGRO, VSP, XIU)? Are they broad based S&P 500 Index or Large Cap Growth Funds like SPLG, SPYG, IVV, VOO, VUG, VONG, VOOG? With $6k to start, 2 should suffice.

I like HOOD, CRWD, NVDA, KTOS, UBER myself, but isn't IBM an old dog? You might as well replace with Oracle.

I have BULL, NBIS, PLTR, RKLB, and in some Chinese AV's in PONY Ai, WRD, and this small Ai stock (RZLV) from the UK. Check them out on Yahoo Finance and good luck. I will not make friends here with that statement, but you shouldn’t built a portfolio for others if you need freaking Reddit for feedback/advise.

I would recommend DCA in a MSCI World ETF or VOO for at least 1 year before adding anything else, to build a habit of investing first. After that year she can decide HERSELF if she wants to take more risk, or if she is fine with getting the average market returns (which is what I recommend for 95% of people). 

If after one year she wants to add individual stocks, let her chose ONE single stock for 1 year at max 10% allocation. It should be a company she likes and will enjoy keeping up with it, reading news, listening earnings calls, study charts. A company like AAPL, NFLX or META which have popular and easy to understand products, not too much volatility and secular trends going on.

1mypdyp,2025-08-24,"Trying to overhaul my IRA and taxable brokerage account with a focus on AI divestment
I’m looking for a gut-check on a simple plan. I have an IRA (\~$80k) and a taxable brokerage (\~$267k) with Morgan Stanley. Both are managed accounts. Right now about 60% of the portfolio equity is effectively tied to big tech/AI (mag7). I’d like to cut that concentration, move to a fund-only setup, and keep costs low. Also somewhat of a hedge towards AI bubble burst.

Target mix (household level)

* 75% U.S. large cap
   * 50% core (S&P 500 or total market: VOO/VTI or equivalents)
   * 25% “top-7 light” allocation to reduce reliance on AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, NVDA, META, TSLA (leaning XMAG; open to RSP if that’s cleaner)
* 25% diversifiers
   * 10% value (VTV or IWD)
   * 5% mid cap (VO or IJH)
   * 4% small cap (VB or IJR)
   * 6% international (VXUS or IXUS)

How I’d implement

* IRA: start with XMAG only (no S&P/total market in IRA) to cut the mega-cap tilt fast with no tax hit. 
* Taxable: keep the S&P/total-market core (VOO/VTI) and systematically exit all single-stock positions, prioritizing the big tech names first. Do it tax-sensitively with about $10–15k per year in realized gains, have dividends go to cash to fund the new ETFs, and aim to finish in roughly three years.

My rationale for this vs just holding S&P 500?

* Keeps broad U.S. exposure but dials down single-name risk.
* XMAG (or equal-weight) helps with the current top-heavy market.
* The diversifier slice is pretty boilerplate imo. 

Questions:

1. Does this combo (core + XMAG + value/mid/small/international) seem like a sensible way to cut big-tech exposure? Not a full divestment (though I'd like to - it's too risky of a bet), but a reduction in overexposure.
2. For placement, would you park value/mid/small in the IRA and leave international in taxable for the foreign tax credit, or is that not worth optimizing?
3. Is \~$10–15k per year in realized gains and a \~3-year glidepath a reasonable way to unwind single stocks in taxable?
4. End stage I'd like to remove the ""managed"" signifier from these two accounts entirely. Has anyone had luck asking for a reduced brokerage fee or flat/retainer model for the advisors? How would you recommend I broach this full strategy with them?
5. Should I deploy something similar with my 403b (if the available funds allow)?
6. Anything else I'm missing?
""Anything else I'm missing?""

I'd question the premise of an AI bubble burst. We've barely begun.

But if that's your thesis, sounds like a reasonable plan. Really interesting. I'm in a similar boat but your strategy is much more thought out. I can't speak to specifics, but the biggest factor that jumps out at me is make sure the expense ratio of each fund is very low.

I'm not familiar with the foreign tax credit, but I would think there's no tax hit in the IRA so I'm curious to learn more about that. SCHD is another broad based fund without so much exposure to tech, and it offers dividends, so that's a big part of my Roth IRA strategy so I can reinvest without the tax hit.

Yeah do what you can at getting rid of any managed account fees. Your plan is self directed anyway so why not? I would that that seriously as those losses will compound. You can also look at something like RSP (Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF) which is an example of an ETF that tracks the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index. 

Other alternative weighting schemes, such as fundamental or factor-based approaches, also exist. This way you will still have exposure to the big names but you won't be overweighted on those names. SCHD looks very enticing. I haven't considered dividends much besides what the advisors already picked up. I'll have to look at that. My original draft actually brought up RSP but I took it out lol.

Since I'd be leaving 50% in SP500, I feel like I'm still pretty well exposed. Based on my math, if AI neither busts nor booms, I'd be looking at a -0.2% to -0.5% drag annually in this allocation strategy. Currently ~60% of my portfolio is saddled in Mag7. After this realignment, that would change to 30%.

Also this wouldn't be a reallocate all at once and cross my fingers strategy. It will take some time to ween off the individual stocks, so I could feasibly benefit from a boom if it happens in the next two years.

I say all this not to correct or contend with anything you said. Just more fully explaining my logic. RSP is interesting for sure and it can sometimes outperform SP500. I guess I just don't find it divest-y enough. If my livelihood weren't on the line I would bet harder against AI. We are witnessing its inability to scale. Gpt5 is a good example of this. None of us are soothsayers but I think this is a reasonable measured hedge should AI not impact the market as people think it will. I see AI as a basic underlying technology, in its infancy, that will likely spread to just about every industry at some point, but that doesn't necessarily indicate the current frontrunners will reap all the benefits.",11,0.66,6,0,dragnmastr85,investing,"['AAPL', 'TSLA', 'AMZN', 'MSFT', 'NVDA', 'META', 'GOOGL']",trying overhaul ira taxable brokerage account focus ai divestment im looking gutcheck simple plan ira 80k taxable brokerage 267k morgan stanley managed accounts right 60 portfolio equity effectively tied big techai mag7 id like cut concentration move fundonly setup keep costs low also somewhat hedge towards ai bubble burst target mix household level 75 us large cap 50 core sp 500 total market voovti equivalents 25 top7 light allocation reduce reliance aapl msft googl amzn nvda meta tsla leaning xmag open rsp thats cleaner 25 diversifiers 10 value vtv iwd 5 mid cap vo ijh 4 small cap vb ijr 6 international vxus ixus id implement ira start xmag sptotal market ira cut megacap tilt fast tax hit taxable keep sptotalmarket core voovti systematically exit singlestock positions prioritizing big tech names first taxsensitively 1015k per year realized gains dividends go cash fund new etfs aim finish roughly three years rationale vs holding sp 500 keeps broad us exposure dials singlename risk xmag equalweight helps current topheavy market diversifier slice pretty boilerplate imo questions 1 combo core xmag valuemidsmallinternational seem like sensible way cut bigtech exposure full divestment though id like risky bet reduction overexposure 2 placement would park valuemidsmall ira leave international taxable foreign tax credit worth optimizing 3 1015k per year realized gains 3year glidepath reasonable way unwind single stocks taxable 4 end stage id like remove managed signifier two accounts entirely anyone luck asking reduced brokerage fee flatretainer model advisors would recommend broach full strategy 5 deploy something similar 403b available funds allow 6 anything else im missing anything else im missing id question premise ai bubble burst weve barely begun thats thesis sounds like reasonable plan really interesting im similar boat strategy much thought cant speak specifics biggest factor jumps make sure expense ratio fund low im familiar foreign tax credit would think theres tax hit ira im curious learn schd another broad based fund without much exposure tech offers dividends thats big part roth ira strategy reinvest without tax hit yeah getting rid managed account fees plan self directed anyway would seriously losses compound also look something like rsp invesco sp 500 equal weight etf example etf tracks sp 500 equal weight index alternative weighting schemes fundamental factorbased approaches also exist way still exposure big names wont overweighted names schd looks enticing havent considered dividends much besides advisors already picked ill look original draft actually brought rsp took lol since id leaving 50 sp500 feel like im still pretty well exposed based math ai neither busts booms id looking 02 05 drag annually allocation strategy currently 60 portfolio saddled mag7 realignment would change 30 also wouldnt reallocate cross fingers strategy take time ween individual stocks could feasibly benefit boom happens next two years say correct contend anything said fully explaining logic rsp interesting sure sometimes outperform sp500 guess dont find divesty enough livelihood werent line would bet harder ai witnessing inability scale gpt5 good example none us soothsayers think reasonable measured hedge ai impact market people think see ai basic underlying technology infancy likely spread every industry point doesnt necessarily indicate current frontrunners reap benefits
1mymdrx,2025-08-24,"$AAPL toward its new ATH. Wyckoff confirms that
From a technical perspective, $AAPL is preparing for a new ATH.  
My analysis is based only on technicals, so you won't find anything related to the fundamental of the Company.

[$AAPL 12M Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Qd76QvMN/) \- This is the highest timeframe we have access to and we don't need anything else.  
Bias is super bullish since price is trending nicely above the EMAs (5-10-20).

[$AAPL 10W Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/q1qZ0bMf/) \- In the 10W chart, we can see price sweeping below the 20 EMA (green one). That is usually a sign that an [Accumulation](https://www.tradingview.com/x/tUSS3XGd/) is taking place. Since we are taking in consideration Wyckoff cycles for this analysis, someone could argue that, currently, we are in a [Re-accumulation 2](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ocRH2uyi/) instead of in a new forming cycle. That could be true because both are valid, it depends on how we decide to see charts. Anyway, price is showing bullishness

[$AAPL 1W Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/6w2dPABd/) \- In the Weekly chart, the price has just come out of an accumulation and currently it's possible we are about to form the first Re-accumulation. I'm expecting price to form at least another indecision candle (whether it will be an inside candle or a lower candle that hits the 5 or 10 EMA) to confirm a solid re-accumulation. If price manages to break that high (black line) it is very likely that price will reach another ATH in 3-6 months

This is not financial advice, obviously.  
Just want to share with you what I see on the charts

\- Alessio
Even if he has a position, why trust? TA is tarot reading for boys. share your position and I'll trust you Technical analysis is astrology for people who barely understand mathematics and who can’t read a 10-Q, 10-K, or 8-K. Aapl is a mature business, they have have no new products, or new customers. Their definition of a new product is ""Iphone 57, the fastest iphone to date"" but effectively the phones are pretty much the same relative to 10 years ago. 

Their increased valuation comes  from increasing the  prices for essentially the same product, but Tim Cook took this logic as far as he could. And now they are hitting a wall. The best time to buy AAPL is after a 20% correction. Ok, so you're posting trading advice on an INVESTING subreddit


Of course I do not trust blindly and apple has no innovation as of now. They're so far behind that I really think they're going to slop. Very short term, TA might be a good tool. I use it too, but not for investing. I cite: I don't care about the fundamentals of a Company.

For me everything what is worth to know, is in the price action 


This, my dear, is trading. Investing cares about fundamentals. This is the difference between these two. One is highly speculative, the other is a bit more common sense.


Trading can be lucrative, investing has a higher probability of that happening though. You are basically saying that, in your opinion, price will not make a new ATH and will start decreasing in value?

Because it is possibly true from a fundamental points of view (even tho I don't know anything about that).  
From a technical perspective we are still long and there are no reasons to think otherwise.  
But, as long as price starts to decline, I more than happy to reevaluate my bias on this asset.

Just from a personal point of view (I'm an Apple enthusiast), I think that even tho iPhones are always the same (more or less like any other mobile device... I didn't see any particular innovation in this sector so far by any of the giants) the value in Apple is not only in the technology, that is always improving, but in the quality of the product, the ""status symbol"" of a MAC or iPhone and in the philosophy/mission/vision of the Company.

When you own a MAC or an iPhone, you basically don't own ""just a device"", but a symbol of something more profound.

Increasing prices increase the difference between a simple mobile device and an iPhone  
I think it's something that will always work

JUST LIKE LUXURY BRANDS I don't know if that is the average, but if you are saying that is because you made your researches, so I'll trust you 😁

Currently, on the [10W Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/xazDpLG8/), we made a 35% drop, so I think we are aligned with the vision 

Thanks for taking the time to comment!  
Much appreciated! No, that skill is not given by TA but by following the news. Tariffs were announced, no TA shows that we were gonna drop in the beginning of april, and then we did. The drop was clear from politics, not from TA.

Hey guys just a quick question,

I’m a uni student and I’ve been holding a few Nvidia shares that I picked up during the crash and they’ve done really well for me. Right now, I can afford to buy about one NVDA share a month, and I’m keen to keep going since I genuinely believe in the company. That said, I’m not sure if I should start diversifying instead. What do you guys think?
You currently possess the most valuable asset in the world - time. You are a guaranteed multi-millionaire... if you dollar cost average into a diversified index fund over the next couple decades. Go ahead and hold your current NVDA shares for as long as you feel like they're a great company. But if I could turn back the clock and be you, I would put the rest into owning the entire market. You'll thank yourself at 40+ Diversification is safe. Single stock picking will always lead to more gains and more losses. I think you are young enough that gambling a few hundred dollars on Nvidia is justifiable. ETFs are boring, but they are generally consistent.

1mxcbrk,2025-08-22,"Nvidia Launches Spectrum-XGS: What This Means for AI & Data Center Investing
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) announced on Friday its **Spectrum-XGS Ethernet**, designed to support data centers and AI super-factories. In late-morning trading, NVDA shares rose 1.7% on the news.

Here’s why this matters for investors:

* **AI Super-Factories & Data Centers**: Spectrum-XGS is designed to allow data centers to scale beyond their individual buildings. Nvidia calls it the **“third pillar” of AI computing**, complementing vertical and horizontal scaling. Essentially, it enables massive AI infrastructures across cities, countries, and even continents.
* **Performance & Efficiency**: The platform integrates with Nvidia’s Spectrum-X, automatically adjusting networks, controlling congestion, latency, and telemetry. Nvidia claims performance nearly **twice that of their Collective Communications Library (NCCL)**.
* **Enterprise Adoption**: Hyperscale companies like **CoreWeave (CRWV)** are already testing the tech, connecting their data centers to Spectrum-XGS Ethernet. Early adoption by industry leaders can indicate strong future demand.
* **Earnings Context**: Nvidia will report next-quarter earnings **after market close on August 27**, with analysts projecting **EPS of $1.01** and **revenue of $46B**.

**Investor Takeaways**:  
For long-term investors, this reinforces Nvidia’s positioning in AI infrastructure, beyond GPUs. The launch highlights continued growth potential in data center and AI markets. It may also influence investment strategies in other hyperscale tech companies and cloud infrastructure providers.
They [announced it back in March at GTC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_waPvOwL9Z8&t=5532s) itself and it is the reason they have maybe a 3-5 year advantage over anyone else out there.

If you're really interested, the ""Speed"" angle isn't the only selling point. Silicon Photonics allows for ridiculous energy savings at the data center scale . . . anyone else using copper for scale out networking like the cutting edge is today (and even next year for the rest of the industry) will be expending a LOT of power and heat and connections prohibiting reasonable competitiveness with Nvidia during this time. (Impossible by the laws of physics for anyone else) > anyone else using copper for scale out

You might be thinking of a different NVIDIA networking technology like infiniband. My crude understanding of the [Spectrum-XGS product](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-introduces-spectrum-xgs-ethernet-to-connect-distributed-data-centers-into-giga-scale-ai-super-factories?utm_source=chatgpt.com) is that this is used for inter-datacenter connections, which are already fiber.

1mx9yqn,2025-08-22,"The pressure on the fed re interest rates
Not sure if this was posted already, but it really explains the outlandish pressure on Jerome Powell to slash interest rates, and to slash them by unheard of amounts. 

https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/economy/trump-goes-on-100-million-bond-buying-spree-here-s-what-it-could-signal-about-future-interest-rates/ar-AA1KYbJh

Investing related because bond prices go up when yields go down, and the next fed chair will be chosen by someone with a huge vested interest in seeing yields fall. 
One thing I would add is the fed chairman doesn't decide rates.  The fed board of governors votes on rates.  

Yes because he is a dimwit and bully Trump will likely replace Powell as chairman (and the market will react to that badly as it should) in May 2026 but Powell if he wishes will remain on as a governor and have an exactly equal vote to the other six.  Even if Powell decided to resign a majority of the governors likewise show no interest in aggressive cuts.  

They are on staggered 14 year terms so one only get replaced every two years.  Short of resignations or deaths Trump only gets to replace one governor now (there is currently a vacancy).  Due to quirk in confirmation delays the next one isn't until 2028.

Now who knows the fascist in chief may attempt to illegally sack them all but merely naming another member as the chairman alone won't do anything material. That’s precisely why they are bullying all the other governors and manufacturing dirt on them to get them to quit too So buy bonds before a rate cut? I found this discussion of Nixon's pressuring of the fed chair to be interesting: https://www.npr.org/2025/01/10/1223918033/richard-nixon-arthur-burns-fed-independence

Unfortunately I think the main lesson we've learned from Nixon is to not record things that would be problematic if revealed. Powell isn't stepping down from shit, the Fed will cut rates when the housing market reflects reality, analysts can get fucked, and Trump is a moron. Not once or twice a moron, like, 34 felonies plus his number of bankruptcies a moron.

None of these guys would be saying shit about rates if smart buyers weren't leaving them holding the real estate bag. Enjoy that, Blackstone and Wells Fargo. Perverting interest rates while unemployment rises is like cocking the gun while it’s pointing at your foot.

Also you have both feet on top of each other. Don't record things that would be problematic if revealed, just blurt them all out on Twitter so often people become numb. That's what Trump just did. . . No matter what happens, I respect my man JPowell. A lot of us were skeptical when he was first appointed during Trump's first term, but he's been a great steward of the Fed even though he's not perfect. I don't envy being in his position with the insane pressure to cut rates and an economy that is most likely experiencing fissures on a deep level that aren't entirely apparent on the surface yet. I find this plausible because it is consistent with Trump's financial priorities and previous methods. He has zero personal boundaries and none of the checks/balances (Congress/courts) are hands-off.

He only needs to simple majority of governors to lower the rate.

So I been doing a little research tying to understand how to set up my Roth for long term growth.

I actually wouldn't use either, as I personally believe better exists in the form of US total market style funds (which of be sure to pair with international as well).

I recently inherited just under $700k from my father who recently passed. It goes without saying that I would happily give it all back for more time with my dad, but here we are. I consider myself a ""lightly"" educated investor. I'm 31, have a house with a 3% mortgage that feels silly to pay off, no credit card or vehicle debt, basically just the house.

However, I am also wondering if I should take some time to research other stock picks with good growth opportunity/increase my positions in some of the individual stocks I own already. Am I overthinking this, am I missing anything, and does anyone have any advice on this?

100% VT and go be a kid.  UPS & AAL won’t do good in a recession. Tarriff inflation has begun rolling in & that’ll send oil higher and hurt those. Plus AAL doesn’t perform well long term has very high debt.  2. Your small fractions of Amazon Tesla plantair etc are so small they won’t move the needle. But for 16 ur a beast Someone gave you bad advice.....lol Dude, starting at 16? You're basically an investing prodigy already-time is your superpower, and those weekly contributions are gold.

Your setup looks solid, but yeah, a heavy tech tilt could sting in a dip. Diversify with non-tech stalwarts: consumer staples like Procter & Gamble, healthcare via Johnson & Johnson, or industrials like Caterpillar. Balances the ride without killing excitement. Asset mix: All stocks/ETFs is fine now, but peek at bonds later for chill vibes in rough markets. Keep it simple-VOO's your broad-market beast, and those QQQ/SPMO drips are smart. I leveled up my thinking on this after reading a book about building a monster dividend portfolio-it focuses on steady ""dividend monsters"" for consistent growth. Perfect for young guns like you building long-term.

Your discipline is the secret sauce-keep grinding, and you'll be set. What's your dream portfolio look like in 10 years? Spill for inspo! You’re overcomplicating things. Just invest in Total US + Total International index funds. Add bonds later in life. Something like VTI + VXUS or VT or VOO and chill. There’s arguments to be made for each setup, but all have their merits. Comes down to personal preference. You’ll beat whatever you’re currently doing in the long run. Pick up a few books like “The Simple Path to Wealth” and “The Little Book of Common Sense Investing.” These will help build your foundational knowledge of investing. What's total $$$ of those stocks in your swing trades? There's so much stuff there in fractional shares which is so minimal to make an impact on any returns. Investing in those Mag 7 stocks in your weekly portfolio is fine, but you won't see much growth from those unlike from a small or mid-cap stock. They are just to big to grow that much. I'll give you a few examples of s/m caps if you like. Not bad. The more you study and learn about business and stocks the lower in market cap you can go. For your age these market caps seem appropriate. I agree with other comments. I never touch airlines. And ups is rough. 

I’m assuming you just rando picked these because it’s popular and not because you’ve dove into their latest 10k. Great start. Keep learning and keep going. Hope you’re spending time and energy on making money. All the returns in the world won’t move the needle if you’re only investing a few hundred dollars.

1mwgy9a,2025-08-21,"Rate my 8 week DCA investment plan

Hey I’m working on an 8 week DCA plan. I sold some losers (PayPal) and am consolidating my portfolio for MAX CAGR. Thought I’d share my ideas and see if anyone has suggestions. I’ll be deploying weekly. I would include AMD but im overweight already on it.


GOOG 18%
AMZN 18%
META 17%
MSFT 11%
NVDA 8%
ADBE 9%
Healthcare (NVO/LLY/VRTX) 10%
Luxury (RACE/LVMUY) 7%
Semis Adjunct (ASML/TSM) 7%


My thesis is to deploy majority into
PEG-friendly compounders, balance with NVDA/MSFT/ADBE and diversify into semis, healthcare, and luxury. 

Curious how this looks from outside view. Am I too concentrated in big tech or is this a good play for long term growth (I am comfortable with volatility and have a 20+ year investment horizon.

Thank you and best of luck 🤞 to all.
Probably worse than 100% VOO I would save time, stress and money,  by lump summing into VOO. All this extra work is unnecessary. 99% you’ll have less returns compared to VOO over the next 20 years Keep in mind, underperforming compounds. The longer you underperform the bigger the gap later on wtf does a 8 week dca mean? I don’t hate the idea but agree w VOO (or better yet SPLG) and chill. You are what any financial advisor would consider extremely overweight on tech. That’s where growth is today, but might not be where it is tomorrow. If the market moves to other companies you miss out with your current idea, whereas VOO or similar would protect you from that Not enough NVDA

Should be 100% NVDA options Concentration only makes sense if you have *an edge*. And you don't, you're litterary *chasing former stars* which, according to all economical theory, will underperform over time. You're buying Nokia, Xerox, Kodak and Cisco because they're staples every needs...



Do yourself a service and stop before you've set yourself back for a lifetime. You don't have an edge, you're litterary following old trends. You're buying the top of every company you know and will underperform because bog companies nstagnatw over time. You're also *missing all the new, hot 10-100 baggers* because you don't diversify. You'll add them after they've gone up 100-1000% and once again buy the top. Sure, *do it your way.

1mweu8o,2025-08-21,"22F Looking for advice from more experienced investors
Hi! I just started investing about 1.5 months ago and this is my portfolio so far. I have a CD and HYSA outside of Fidelity, so my emergency funds are covered. I have no debt. My goals are both shorter and long term. I would like to buy a house/apt within the next 10 years and would like to occasionally use my individual taxable as extra income. My Roth is of course for retirement and for building wealth. I know I have two funds that cover the S&P 500, but they are in different accounts that serve different goals, so I think its okay. I would love some advice from older and more experienced people. I love learning from others! :)

I've been basically following boglehead's lazy portfolio approach for ~20 years for everything (different allocations for retirement versus non retirement). Doesn't have to be as complicated as you're making it.

https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Lazy_portfolios Too much exposure to specific individual stocks. General wisdom is to limit individual stocks to 5% of your portfolio.

This is probably fine for now since your portfolio is still small(15% of $3000 is $450 so not a big deal if you lose $450), but as your portfolio grows, try to abide by this. What is your investment 'thesis' for each of these? Like why UNH? This is truly the only relevant question and since OP seems unable to ansver it she shouldn't buy stocks. She should buy the index and realise *she's not smarter or more educated then the world's best* so why does she think she can beat them at their day job?




Sorry to be brutally honest OP but ""your"" picks are well below amateur level. It seems you don't even know what you buy or why, sibce the overlap is insane and justification doesn't exist. Don't buy what reddit/TikTok/YouTube tells you...those people are *selling their bags to you, they're not your friend*. Do yourself a service and go boglehead, or look back in 10 years and curse yourself for not listening to common sense. Your choice. There is not enough information in your post to help you. You would probably benefit from reading through [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/young_adult), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/early_career).

Do you have a really good reason for picking individual stocks over index funds?

Without knowing anything about your situation, I would sell everything in your taxable brokerage and put it into your ROTH IRA. I would then sell everything in your ROTH IRA and then invest in a Target Date Fund or build your own [three-fund portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads%C2%AE_investment_philosophy#Create_a_portfolio). Personally, my indexes outperformed my individual picks except for 2 individual stock picks. Had I put it all into indexes, I would have done better even taking the 2 out performers into account.

Especially since your time horizon is at least 10 years, I would more focus on just padding your index accounts while maxing out your Roth (Especially any employer match). Be diverse, don't just do SPY. But stick to the broader indexes with a little bit in some secondary (you've got a little in SGOV, which is perfect). What you are really asking about is called ""asset allocation"".

Since you are using Fidelity, [Here is their intro to the subject](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/asset-allocation)

You can have different asset allocations for different goals. 

I would be wary of picking individual stocks.  You are taking on a lot of risk until you get to the point where you can have a portfolio of 20+ well understood/researched stocks.  That said, my wife keeps a seperate IRA where she trades individual stocks, but we keep that outside of The Big Plan. Just do VOO. If you want international just do VT. I did a lot of my own investing and stock picking from ages 29 to 37. I sold $250,000 worth of stock in early 2020 (just two weeks before the Covid crash) for a down payment on a house, selling 15 different individual equities.

I back-tested my portfolio of the stocks I had  sold and of the 15 different stocks I had researched, hand-picked and eventually sold, only 2 of them outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO specifically). In short, I would have made more money and done a LOT less work and stress just buying VOO and forgetting about it. 

I now just DCA into VOO every two weeks and forget about individual stocks. I wish I had decided to do that at a younger age. I've realized that I'm no good at picking stocks, so I'm going for stuff like

* SCHD - almost 4% dividend, P/E of about 17 (fair by historical standards)

* BRK-B - solid track record of actively managed returns, and they keep cash to time the market (and timing the market works for them, just not for me).

* VYMI - for broad international diversification

broad index funds scare me, because they force you to put money into meme stocks like TSLA and PLTR.

1mw1ioz,2025-08-21,"Do not know what to do with my upcoming dividends.
Hi guys, I (23) will be receiving $3,800 in dividends next week and do not know what to do with it. 

For starters, my investmemt goals are:

- $1 Million by age 55.

- Every Year I aim to gain 6-8% (average returns)

- This is done by contributing 40% - 60% of my income which comes out to be $20 per week or $80 per month (currently studying and doing small gigs, soon to increase with my upcoming internship, hoping to increase it to 650 to be aggressive)

My current financial situation is this, I am heavily invested in stock market with $122,400 and unrealised profit of $50,000, with a side dividend of $7,500 per year (with no tax on it at all).

If youre wondering why my unrealised profit/ROI is so high, its due to the lucky timing I had back in 2021 when I was DCA'ing into 4 stocks which i currently still am investing in and have not sold any of it since and its now its at their ATH. 

I invest heavily in financial banks, and global asset management operation sectors, holding 3 bank stocks and 1 global asset company stock.

Currently, Im going to receive $3,800 with my add on contribution which I have 3 options available for me right now and do not know which to take.

 2 options: I can invest it back into my current portfolio at their current ATH. OR I can diversify it into another sector like cloud services like Amazon or Google (I have not touched the US market due to weak conversion rates).

 But with the current state of the US, I'm not really that confident in that country as of now even if WB said not to bet against the US. 

The unpopular 3rd option for me is to just leave it as cash-in-hand, and do not touch it until I find another valuable company.




Obvious choice to reinvest No need to watch that closely. The USA is an absolute powerhouse. They have the leverage, it's going to work out fine. If it starts really hurting them, they can just walk it back in the next Presidency. But it's not hurting them right now, if anything, it's an asymmetric bet that might really pay off here. Regardless, you also don't need to really watch the central bank too closely, they may lag one or two quarters, but eventually they will always react. And it balances, either the economy is running hot with full employment, in which case, great! Or it's not, and in which case, rates dump and stocks skyrocket. It all works out, just deploy your capital in useful things and think in decades. People who focus on the short term get beat by those who just ride the macro tidal waves. Automation and AI is also going to become a huge gravity well for US power. Demographics won't be as big of an advantage as it once was once those trends kick in. Also you need to look at Uranium supplies and who secures those. US has already dropped the red tape. Whoever gets the talent, power and the chips is going to dominate the next decades. And the US has a great headstart here. It's hard to bet against the US. not 4 bank stocks

3 Bank stocks.

1 Global asset management and operation stock.

Again, my average aim of return is 6-8% annually, so i am in no rush as well. 10% annual return is already above my average aim.

I will take alook at the companies you just mentioned, thanks! I believe he was being sarcastic.


...I hope I do not know too hahaha. You will have a million by 35-40, no? just reinvest them. Reinvest and chill Yes, reinvest is usually always the right choice for younger folks, especially in the US market. Especially when done with a DCA approach. Trying to time the market is almost always a sure fire way to miss some serious upside.

And yeah, people have no idea. The USA is far from cooked. That economy is still the bastion of free market capitalism. Sure China and India are growing fast, but every single wealthy person I know from there is figuring out how to move their money OUT and into better jurisdictions to buy stocks trading on US markets. The country im investing in does not allow autoinvest and only allows a 100 lot per purchase.

And yes, I could diversify to US stocks for that function, but im super new to the US market and it will take me 1-2 months to study and choose what company i want to invest in.",0,0.28,20,0,miraiyuni,investing,['GOOGL'],know upcoming dividends hi guys 23 receiving 3800 dividends next week know starters investmemt goals 1 million age 55 every year aim gain 68 average returns done contributing 40 60 income comes 20 per week 80 per month currently studying small gigs soon increase upcoming internship hoping increase 650 aggressive current financial situation heavily invested stock market 122400 unrealised profit 50000 side dividend 7500 per year tax youre wondering unrealised profitroi high due lucky timing back 2021 dcaing 4 stocks currently still investing sold since ath invest heavily financial banks global asset management operation sectors holding 3 bank stocks 1 global asset company stock currently im going receive 3800 add contribution 3 options available right know take 2 options invest back current portfolio current ath diversify another sector like cloud services like amazon google touched us market due weak conversion rates current state us im really confident country even wb said bet us unpopular 3rd option leave cashinhand touch find another valuable company obvious choice reinvest need watch closely usa absolute powerhouse leverage going work fine starts really hurting walk back next presidency hurting right anything asymmetric bet might really pay regardless also dont need really watch central bank closely may lag one two quarters eventually always react balances either economy running hot full employment case great case rates dump stocks skyrocket works deploy capital useful things think decades people focus short term get beat ride macro tidal waves automation ai also going become huge gravity well us power demographics wont big advantage trends kick also need look uranium supplies secures us already dropped red tape whoever gets talent power chips going dominate next decades us great headstart hard bet us 4 bank stocks 3 bank stocks 1 global asset management operation stock average aim return 68 annually rush well 10 annual return already average aim take alook companies mentioned thanks believe sarcastic hope know hahaha million 3540 reinvest reinvest chill yes reinvest usually always right choice younger folks especially us market especially done dca approach trying time market almost always sure fire way miss serious upside yeah people idea usa far cooked economy still bastion free market capitalism sure china india growing fast every single wealthy person know figuring move money better jurisdictions buy stocks trading us markets country im investing allow autoinvest allows 100 lot per purchase yes could diversify us stocks function im super new us market take 12 months study choose company want invest
1mvyr98,2025-08-21,"Growth investing for early 20s
So, I'm trying to create a plan for the future as I'm 23 (making 85k) and currently, I want to have a high growth investing strategy currently I have a ROTH IRA with $80 going into it monthly to a SWPPX mutual fund (I can likely bump that up another 100), a 401k with 5% employee contribution + 4% employer contribution (again going into SWPPX), and 3% employee stock purchase, all totaling about 8-9k

I was looking at growth ETFs in a regular brokerage account and was looking at VOOG or SPYG (leaning SPYG because practically the same as VOOG, but lower expense ratio) with about 150-200 a month going into them

But, I'm still a bit confused and feel like I'm missing something. Right now, my current goal is to hopefully get high growth over the next 2-5 years that I can eventually transition to something with decent dividends to supplement my current income

But, I'm looking at recent news regarding markets, tarrifs, etc. and I'm worried about the market, hence my indecision currently.

Any thoughts?
The entire point is to not have to pay attention and pick a stock where that difference is a rounding error. You’re suggesting timing the market. It’s a completely different mentality and requires extensive research to be viable long term. The idea of splitting voo and spy isn’t a horrible idea. 50 into each every week. Being your 23 all the really big growth is when you get 15+ years into it, which you’ll likely have larger amounts. 5 years isn’t long enough for high growth. Don’t worry about the markets, DCA and you’ll win in The longrun. What are you talking about.  Both SPYG and VOOG are pure equities. You are young, with a very long runway for investing.   There’s always going to be worries in investing, but it’s going to work out in the long run if you don’t overthink it.  I think having a growth fund is a great idea and will compliment your existing portfolio.  I wouldn’t be thinking about it with the mindset that you’ll be switching to dividends in a few years, you’re in your 20s not your 60s.  You want to invest and keep investing and not sell anything until you need the money. You're betting on high growth in a 2-5 timeline, on pure equities.  That is very risky. Correct, don't split it between those 2. They are covering the same index - not sure what OC is talking about.

VOO is better to buy and hold (lower expense ratio). You'd want to use SPY if you are playing options due to greater liquidity. But for your purproses, VOO is better.

If you are concerned about Tariffs effect, you could put 5-10% in VXUS (everything outside of the US) to get you some diversification. Also, ""growth"" stocks - one's that don't pay dividends, are usually hit the hardest by economic slowdowns, so maybe instead of picking a growth fund, go basic with VOO or VTI, then some diversification into VXUS or a bond fund (I'd recommend VTIP for a Roth IRA). As a young 20 year old, my advice would be to pick 1 or 2 securities / assets that you think are undervalued and have big potential in the future, and go all in. You should be growth/value investing at your age. To make dividends even worth it, you need 1M+ in assets, and right now what you need is high risk and high growth potential. This is the only time where a mistake or a huge loss is litteraly nothing, and you can make it all back. This won't be true in your 30s or 40s, so take risks now. When I was early 20s, I bought TSLA with everything I had and rode that for a decade. I wouldn't buy it at your age today, because it's worth over 1T in mcap, but my point is, you need to research, and take a calculated gamble with high conviction on an undervalued security/asset that can 10-100x in a decade. The ETFs and passive investing can wait a bit. I'm not looking to split it, I would just prefer to have one to do it in one ETF

What is DCA? And don't sell. I would be retired if I didn't get so excited I doubled my money on Facebook when it went from 18 to 40. I would not longer be working if I had just kept those shares. Sorry, I got confused and thought equities = real estate for some reason

1mvvg7x,2025-08-20,"18 year old investment checklist thoughts?
hey everyone, i’m 18 and just starting to invest for real. wanted to throw my portfolio out here and see if it makes sense or if i’m messing something up.

currently holding:
	•	50% SCHG (us tech etf… kinda feels the same as voo so i just went with this)
	•	20% in some blue chips (nvda, meta, apple, msft)
	•	10% SCHD (dividends)
	•	10% VXUS (international)
	•	10% SGOV (short term / cash-ish spot)

also thinking about getting into btc, maybe with a cold wallet later, but haven’t pulled the trigger yet.

my thought process is basically:
	•	heavy on tech for long term growth
	•	some dividends from schd
	•	vxus for international stuff
	•	sgov just to park a little safer money

still learning and planning to keep adding, but wanted some honest feedback. am i too concentrated? anything obvious i’m missing?

Anyone under 50 should skip SCHD or these mediocre dividend ETFs, International at 10% is ok, skip the SGOV and put aside 6 months emergency cash in a HYSA at 4-5% interest.

At 18 I go with 80% growth in SPYG or SCHG, 10% International, up to 10% in individual small/mid cap growth stocks not in SPYG or SCHG. Examples are (BULL, NBIS, PLTR, RKLB, PONY, WRD, RZLV AI). Good luck investing.

>10% SCHD (dividends) • 10% VXUS (international) • 10% SGOV (short term / cash-ish spot) Skip SCHD, it doesn’t make sense to focus on dividends with any percentage of your portfolio at your age. I’d also roll that “20% in blue chips” into SCHG as it will be pretty much the same but better diversified. I also wouldn’t allot a specific percentage of my portfolio to SGOV but instead 6 months of your average expenses plus anything you need for planned large purchases (like a down payment or vacation). 

In short: 90% SCHG, 10% VXUS. SGOV emergency fund + necessary liquidity As others have said, at 18 years old your investing horizon allows for a very aggressive strategy.

If your goal is to be hands off with a passive investing strategy, I'd go with an S&P100 index fund (OEF).

If you're interested in actively managing your portfolio, I'd start with a 10% allocation toward whatever strategy you feel best aligned with (growth, value, momentum, etc). As you become more knowledgeable and confident in your investment thesis, you could gradually allocate more towards individual stocks and less into an index fund.

Getting an emergency fund going, staying out of debt and living within your means is also critical. A lot of investors get into trouble because they overextend their finances and sell off holdings during a market down turn which is catastrophic to portfolio performance.

I'm not a professional financial advisor; just my personal opinion. This is basically 80% US large-cap/tech when you stack SCHG plus your individual tech stocks, so you're pretty concentrated. SCHD adds a tiny bit of value tilt but not enough to change the picture, VXUS is too small for real international exposure. Here’s a breakdown of your portfolio: https://www.insightfol.io/en/portfolios/report/0db3a22815/ Aside from introducing uncompensated risk with a single sector, picking tech for longterm growth [is problematic](https://pwlcapital.com/investing-technological-revolutions/) because AI hype has driven the prices up drastically.

	•	Any suggestions on how to balance this portfolio better long-term?

Appreciate your thoughts!

I thought that was thousands...then realized dollars. 

I would compare annual returns to entire holdings in VOO. One dog in the portfolio can wipe out your earnings. Conversely 3 lucky wins keep you a float. 

PLTR...not time to invest...missed the hype. 

At this point you are dabbling, which is fun to watch the ups and downs. You learn that there is no logic to any of it...other than long term the indexes rise. Why? because 401k contributions pump money into it weekly with payroll. It is sheer volume of money being inject that make the 500 rise... Just go 100% VOO, friend Im just 17 and broke teenager ;) Good job. Keep cranking the money in. But always go back to the annual returns and compare it. See if all the dabbling is worth it or just set it and forget it. >

With effectively $1k invested, this is effectively a play account.  It's okay to spend time trying to eek out a bigger-than-market return here if you really enjoy doing so and are wiling to take the risk.  From a pure time-investment standpoint, it's almost certainly not worth your time and you should just focus on generating more income and shoving it all into VOO. QQQ is not ideal to hold High risk high reward. You're almost entirely concentrated in US tech and semiconductors. Been a great trade over the last decade but you must be aware that one policy change or industry specific black swan could crush your entire portfolio. Cheers btw! 80 percent VOO and 20 percent QQQ ?

1mvaskr,2025-08-20,"Best ETF to hedge against an AI crash
I will keep it short.

Thesis: I believe AI is in a bubble and is due for a crash. 

1)the product is bad quality. It is a black box makes mistakes, period. This is not an excel command that “user error” leads to applying a comma or colon out of place leading to a wrong calculation. If these AI tools were like a humble excel command that randomly makes mistakes, people would think it’s a bad command. You are seeing these repercussions in the legal field where AI produces fake citations, or more broadly where Microsoft’s M365’s audit log is likely consistently wrong. Nightmare scenario for businesses. 

2)if you look at the S&P500 by firm, the growth is only coming from tech companies investing into AI. It is a private sector investment boom. The rest of the economy is struggling. And all these investing firms got to show are these AI chatbots, wrong answers on Google ai overview, etc. 

I am dumping money into small-medium cap (the S fund in the TSP) in preparation to hedge against these big 7 firms or so collapsing. Any thoughts or advice on how to hedge exposure from these tech companies?
You could buy sector ETFs individually and be intentionally underweight in the tech sector. Good luck. You don't have to turn the OP's post into a debate. He has a legitimate investing strategy saying that a sector is over valued that you can either agree with or disagree with. He is just asking a question on how to implement it. No need to call his view ""uninformed"" and ""dumb"". I can easily point to blockchain and NFTs as being a similar over valued sector that people made money on the downside of. You knowing how to use an LLM is not the same as knowing how AI is being implemented. As with any nascent technology, it is an iterative process which improves the product over time. Getting out now is the same as selling Microsoft in mid-2000 IMHO. But I understand, everyone's risk tolerance is different, everyone's timeframe is different. Mid-cap investment isn't a ""bad"" move, I just think that there is missed opportunity here based on flawed understanding. Respectfully. I agree there is a lot of AI hype, but Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google were all doing very well before the AI talk and they offered plenty of other products and services. I would not want a portfolio without these giants. 

XMAG is a S&P500 ETF without the mag7, literally 493 holdings. It’s still new so I can only compare the YTD performance, but it’s doing very well when compared to S&P, sometimes beating it. There is no Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, or Google carrying it.

RSP is an equal weighted S&P500 fund, meaning each holding makes up 0.29% or less of the ETF. It can’t rely on big AI tech companies to carry it. Despite this disadvantage RSP only underperformed S&P by about 3% over 10 years, and about 2.5% over 5 years. 

Based on this data collected from Fidelity.com, I would not abandon the S&P 500. If you’re still nervous then maybe consider XMAG or RSP, FSTA for consumer staples equity, or other sector ETFs. The larger the collection of ETFs though, the more aggravating it will be to manage, good luck. An Euro Stoxx 600 ETF. Here in Europe we lack AI companies, and our stocks are more reasonably priced than tbe SP500. Only coming from tech companies investing in AI? Have you checked walmart's chart? Home depot's chart? John Deere's chart? For fucks sake.

Go do a little of research before posting this garbage, please.

From 3 minutes of being on S&P's website:
Industrials up 14.66% YTD

Financials up 8.68% YTD

Consumer staples up 6.51% YTD

Communication services up 15.25% YTD

Materials up 7.94% YTD

Utilities up 13.16% YTD


What numbers are you looking at? To just be clear if you look at the YTD sectoral returns, everything currently outside of healthcare and energy are actually up. There are also cross over effects such as industrial and construction development expanding in relation to other areas like technology for data centres for example. GOOG is the best hedge against AI bubble I've been an engineer for 20 years. As the saying goes, ""all models are wrong and some models are useful.""

AI makes mistakes? Okay, cool, everyone is already aware of that. So what? It's a tool in the toolbox.

1muuu98,2025-08-19,"If Reddit stabilize over 200$ we might be going towards a stock split
Assuming they manage to keep beating revenue expectations, and people start using Reddit Answers to get info, instead of adding site:reddit on a google search, perplexity, chatgpt or what have you, this social network could indeed enter ""mainstream"".  
If that happens It would be reasonable to expect the market capitalization reach 200 billions; this would bring each individual stock to around 4x the current price hence why we might see a split.

Wtf There is a reason though why many companies don't like to split.  If things go bad and your share price gets really low you could get delisted.  A high share price can be thought of as ""delistment insurance"".

Not only that, but an investment banker might charge up to a million dollars just to split the stock.

1mukloz,2025-08-19,"Would you make any changes?
I am starting a portfolio and want some opinions based off of what I plan to invest in. Currently my plan is to go 50% into VOO, 20% into BRK.B, 15% into UNH, 10% into NVDA, and 5% into SOFI. This is based on about 40k of cash

Would anyone have an advice or changes they would personally make for these pickups?

Open to any and all suggestions!


If your goal is long-term wealth building rather than speculation, going all-in on VOO (or a simple mix like VOO + VXUS for global exposure) is the clean, boring, effective strategy. Lower stress, lower maintenance, fewer ways to mess it up.

If you really want the fun of stock picking, keep it small, 5–10% “play money”, and let the rest compound in the index.

You’re taking on more risk than you probably realise. Picking individual stocks feels attractive because it gives you control and the chance to “beat the market”, but the odds are against you over the long run.

If you are not market, then you are racing against market, and this is loosing game.

There’s also opportunity cost. Every dollar in UNH or SOFI is a dollar not riding the US economy through something like VOO. Over decades, broad diversification compounds quietly but relentlessly, while individual bets swing around and may never catch up.

And we haven't even started on looking at financials of this companies, SOFI is risky, there's a lot of debt on their books, lawsuits on UNH, and NVDA is too expensive.

Is any of them passing hurdle rate? Very solid input! Do comment again please VOO is fine „anytime“.

For stocks find a good business at a reasonable price. If you just want to pile money in and not have to follow things id do 

VOO - 55%
IXUS - 30%
IJH - 10%
IJR - 5%

My etf portfolio is exactly this allocation and despite the red day im up 36% YTD. I swear investing has never been easier.

Edited to proper allocation numbers. Thanks for the input Just realizing u gave me 110% lol Stacking your exposure to brk is probably fine but I’d not do 15% myself, maybe 10% there , nvda already going to be a big position for you in voo.

If it was me I’d instead swap nvda with something else. Low risk defensive like WM or something? I’d take the 5% from lowering brk (edit mistyped nvda here originally) and if you really want more semiconductor exposure toss that into soxx or spread it out amongst top 5 holdings of soxx and save yourself the expense fee. 

Just my thoughts- Iduno if this whole not financial advise thing is really needed but not financial advise.  You didn't state your age or time horizon, but if you're young, just go with 60-70% VOO, and a large cap growth like SPYG or SCHG at 30%. the market and especialy voo is so overvalued now. they say you can't time the market but I would realize that portfolio very slowly. im talking a year.

1mujscb,2025-08-19,"Sell or keep GOOG and AMZN
Hello, during the big downturns during early Covid I bought shares of GOOG and AMZN in a Roth IRA account. Last January I sold half of the shares and put the proceeds in VOO because both investments had doubled and I figured that was a reasonable way to take profits and reduce risk.

Googl is valued below the average of S&P 500 but have higher estimated growth. Why would you sell a stock with those fundamentals? Man so many sleeping on AMZN and I love that.  $400 incoming  Top investors and hedge funds have been adding Amazon in Q1 and Q2 and are keeping large positions in Google. I feel like I trust billionaires a bit more than redditors but take your pick. Both are safe bets for the future, AMZN might see a bumpy road ahead due to tariffs and commercial wars.

I have GOOGL with +13% and will continue to hold because the peak is not even close yet. So at least keep GOOGL and might want to trim AMZN. Amazon lives and dies by AWS.

And google will eventually start taking more and more market share.

Google is the only company that has its own leading AI models, trained on its own hardware (Google TPUs), with its own data (nobody has data like Google), running on its own cloud platform and one of the greatest distribution channels (android).

Google is the only company that is on the cutting edge of every level of AI stack. That is a flywheel that will propel google cloud much further and Amazon will lose out. 

Every other big tech company has atleast a couple of items on that stack missing. Microsoft has the cloud, distribution (windows) but does not have its own models and its own hardware to train on. Amazon has its own hardware to train on, has cloud platform, does not have distribution and does not have its own models. 

Another fundamental difference between Amazon and Google in the form of an anecdote: Google’s AI is led by a prodigy who literally won a Nobel prize in chemistry last year as a side quest. His team created a ground breaking Ai model that can help with drug discovery. 

Amazon’s AI efforts is led by some rando middle manager MBA who does not even have a PhD. There is a reason why Amazon seems to be nowhere in AI race. 

I would sell Amazon and buy Google. Have been doing that myself. The thing I love about Google is that every cool up and coming tech company talks about their position against their top competition. And it seems, regardless of the niche, one of the top competitors is always Google. What I remember from the last earning numbers search was up not down even after the AI hype and revenue was still driven. Also google is also doing the AI snippet thing.

What’s the difference between investing in spy and spyi

And qqq vs qqqi

I’m thinking of investing in both in all 4 in my ira on a weekly basis. Maybe $100 per week in each totaling 400 per week total across all 4. 

Does this make any sense? Overlap? Would I be better off picking one of each class and $200 per week into each like $200 spyi and $200 qqqi
Then research that. Also consider that these funds are really new, and the longest history available has them underperforming their index. So, you need to consider how new they are, how they make income, and in what market environment that strategy is most profitable.  What research did you do?  Looking up the funds on something like Morningstar and reading the summaries would give you a general idea of how they are different.  Do you understand how they generate income?  What is your time horizon for retirement?  Are you willing to sacrifice higher gains for income?  Then go with SPYI and QQQI.  If you have a long-term time horizon, then go with SPY and QQQ.  SPYI and QQQI are covered call ETFs, they will always underperform the underlying in a bull market.  Their main draw is generating dividend income with favorable tax status as return of capital. https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=405649

> The simple answer is there is no free lunch and selling covered calls does not 'generate income', it reduces volatility at the cost of reducing total return.

There's also a quote in there about people going to extreme lengths to avoid using bonds for the things that bonds are good at, which I think applies here. Income and growth are not opposites in this case. The opposite of growth in equities is value, and neither refer to returns, they refer to the current share price of a company relating to its inherent value. Growth means you're wolling to pay more than it's currently worth on the expectation that it'll be worth more in the future. 

Fixed income and growth can be used when talking about allocations as oppositeswhere they refer to the volatility of asset classes. Fixed income is stuff like bonds with low volatility and growth mean stuff like equities, with high volatility. That's completely separate from growth type companies within equities. It's confusing and I hate it, but that's how it is. 

This is a broad generalization, but any kind of income fund has downsides that are unnecessary if you're not spending that income, and it makes no sense to spend income from an investment while simultaneously contributing to investments. It's just an over complicated way to contribute less. Honestly, why not have a mix of both?  I have both SPY and QQQ based etfs as well as a sizable SPYI, QQQI, IAUI, BTCI, and IDVO dividend portfolio.  The main draw for me on dividends is that my career path is fairly unstable and I can just turn off DRIP on my dividend stocks to help support income in the case of job loss instead of selling shares at a possible loss. Idk I was wondering if I’m over diversifying here Just by VOO and/or QQQM.  Both SPYI and QQQI are counterproductive unless you are retired with lowish income. Maybe 5 years or less.

I feel I am fairly savvy with managing finances and would consider myself slightly above novice with regards to trading and investing. 

I currently have about $55K invested in stocks, with the remaining $85k from a recent severance sitting in a high yield savings (3.5% INT). 

I am looking for advice on the best ways to invest some of this $85K with the intention of providing me some buffer until I find my next job.

Some of the options I have considered are as follows, but would like to hear your opinions.  Thanks!

1.  Keep it all in high-yield savings and get a little bit of interest every month.

2.  Put it in a high-yield, no penalty CD with a slightly higher interest rate of 4.52%. 

3.  Invest in some index funds or ETFs such as Vanguard or SPY? 

4.  Invest some in a couple of stocks that  are fairly strong.  I currently have about $20K tied up in NVDA and NBIS and was considering expanding my position in these two as they are fairly strong.

Edit - spelling 
Keep it in cash (HYSA, MMFs, or T-Bills) till you get another job. You did not mention money market funds. Yolo it in Tesla shares Keep 6 months emergency fund in the hysa and put the rest in an index fund All markets seem to be at all time high rn. I am in a similar situation  (sitting on cash / high yield savings). But I just think everthing is overpriced and the SPY seems to super concentrated (top 10 companies are about 40% of the index and 490 companies are 60% !!) IMO maybe it's okay to wait it out a bit before junping in with a big amount all together. Maybe low key invest a bit every month in undervalued dividend aristrocats, at least that's what I am doing and I have almost exactly the same kind of numbers in Euros sitting in savings (80%) and invested (20%). With valuations like they are now, all at once is not the way to go.  DCA. And don't forget to add some Palantir and crypto. Except that statistics show DCA doesn’t beat lump sum. It’s a risk-management and psychological tool, not a return-maximizing one. If you might need to spend it while you look for another job, a high yield savings account or money market fund is best.

Hey everyone,

My bank RM and the wealth management team suggested this investment plan. The structure is:

I’ll have to pay around ₹2 lakhs per year

Duration: 10 years of payment

At the 30th year, I’ll receive a lump sum payout


They also shared a calculator and some projections ( below).

I’m not very sure if this is a good deal compared to other options in the market, so wanted to get some opinions here before committing.

Would love to hear your thoughts on whether such long-term plans are worth it or if I should consider other alternatives.

1mua058,2025-08-19,"Thoughts on an ex-US Strategy
It is no surprise that American exceptionalism ebbs and flows with respect to the rest of the world. There is a cyclical nature to the dominance of the rate of change of US market capitalization, and as such there are clear periods where the US underperforms. 


The current geopolitical tensions coupled with a weakening USD may have started the cycle of the ex-US market outperforming the US for a while. Nothing about this is scary - it is a natural process that has been happening since the US was founded. Investors with a global vision have been wanting to take advantage of this situation and see which markets their capital would work the hardest for them.


As a long-term ETF advocate, dividend lover, and near Boglehead convert, I’d like to share with you some of my views regarding how I am planning on investing in a period of potential US underperformance. Let me start by saying that I am not divesting from the US, nor am I scared about my holdings of American companies. A large part of this is globalization and how a significant portion of American companies’ revenues come from abroad. On the other hand, you also have international companies, such as $ASML, that sell their goods and services to the US. Again, whatever the cycle may bring, and whenever it may start, or however long it may last, it is a natural process of global capital markets.


Without having you wait further, I will first list a couple of assumptions to guide this pseudo-analytical discussion:


1- The $ is weakening with respect to some important reserve currencies like € and will remain relatively weaker for a while


2- The US market overall has seen very high P/E ratios whereas ex-US companies have been relatively undervalued


3- Ex-US companies have higher dividend yields compared to their US counterparts


I hope that these points will significantly simplify and guide the following ideas. Let us look at the combined effects of these points and what conclusions they encourage us to draw:


1 & 2 - In $ terms, ex-US companies have gained value due to the $ devaluation which gives momentum to capital inflows into these companies (prices going up tend to draw more capital which makes prices go up further)


1 & 3 - Ex-US companies will be paying even more in dividends due to the devaluation of the $, meaning that even if they grow their dividends relatively little in their home currencies, in $ terms their dividends have already grown by about 10%


2 & 3 - As the undervaluation of the non-US market decreases, ex-US companies’ dividend yields will decrease which might push them to grow their dividends


Note that the pairwise interaction between these points is why we see an initial acceleration of the shift from US market capitalization towards ex-US market capitalization. There tends to be some overcorrective behavior which then results in a steady state, seen by the peak in the attached graph, followed by the reversal towards another cycle. Again, it is all natural. 


Now, the important question remains: what should investors do? More specifically, what have I been doing and will be continuing to do?


Well, I am well aware of the popular ETF VT, but suggesting that would be cheating as it makes this entire analysis redundant, and frankly would result in bland results. Of course the ETFs VXUS (all non-US markets) and VEA (developed non-US markets) are also very popular. VEA has the advantage of not dealing with emerging markets, which, while promising, act like a small- or mid-cap index. There is always some political unrest, missed loan payment, climatic challenges etc that make pureplay investments into emerging markets challenging. Yet, emerging markets tend to also grow the quickest - of course a feature of volatility. Therefore, it is generally accepted that you may as well lean towards VXUS, even though VEA slightly outperforms it. 


OK, but what do we do with the facts of $ devaluation and ex-US paying higher dividends compared to US companies? Well, we need to understand that the $ is devalued with respect to currencies such as the € or £, basically currencies of developed markets. We may be getting closer to an answer now… 


My favorite international dividend ETFs: 


* SCHY (a developed markets ETF with a dividend yield of 3.75% and an expense ratio of 0.08%) 


* VYMI (a total ex-US ETF with a dividend yield of 4% and an expense ratio of 0.17%). 


What I love about this pair is that they have a measly 16% overlap and hold a combined 1700+ companies! They present an incredibly diversified international dividend portfolio already.


If your favorite US-based ETFs are SCHD and VYM, this is probably great news for you. You are already familiar with this type of investment vehicle and might sleep better at night by adding them to your portfolio. 


For the younger folks out there, or those who simply want to have some more growth in an ex-US portfolio, the next perfect ETF will be… IDMO! If you are already familiar with SPMO, you will likely appreciate its ex-US counterpart as well. IDMO is the ex-US momentum ETF with a slightly steep expense ratio of 0.25% and a dividend yield of around 2%. 


IDMO is the perfect candidate to add to the base of SCHY and VYMI because it has very little overlap with both ETFs. Specifically, IDMO’s overlap with SCHY is around 11%, whereas it is slightly higher at 25% with VYMI. 


You may want to use these overlap values, dividend yields, as well as growth characteristics to create a portfolio of your own. Using a rudimentary portfolio backtesting tool starting from 2022, it looks like a portfolio made up of 40% IDMO, 30% SCHY, and 30% VYMI has a comparable performance to VOO whereas VEA lags severely behind (try it out yourself on https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio#analysisResults). The combinations of ETFs I suggest here has been able to hold its own against the S&P 500 during a period where the US has outperformed non-US capital markets. This is an incredible feat that should definitely have you reconsider your international allocation strategy. 


I hope this helps and I’m curious as to what you have to say!
>Well, I am well aware of the popular ETF VT, but suggesting that would be cheating as it makes this entire analysis redundant, and frankly would result in bland results.

I think your analysis could have used a little more justification why I just shouldn't buy VT. I'll gladly accept bland results if it reduces the risk of running out of money in retirement. \> Using a rudimentary portfolio backtesting tool starting from 2022

Sigh. what’s the point? Missing all the interesting good years. Ehy not start from last week while we are at it?

Oh, those ETFs did not exist before 2022? Well, then this whole post may be a waste of bytes then, huh?

  
I appreciate the efforts (maybe ChatGPT helped quite a bit), but the post is a bit all over the place? What’s the TLDR high level summary that you expect people to take away? You are not much of a Booglehead. time in the market beats timing the market.

Oh so many people were convinced that 2023 was it. they missed 24% returns. then a bunch were smug about sticking with 2023 because 2024 was the year to skip. those also missed a 24% year. 

even if you are right at the end you'll end up losing. if by dumb luck this is the right one,  you'll give it all back the next time you guess wrong. Fair enough. This assumes you already hold a US specific ETF like a VOO or VTI, leaving only the VXUS part of VT out.

I would compare VXUS against a three fund portfolio of SCHY, VYMI, and IDMO. 

A lot of people seem to dislike how ex-US VT is and tend to have 80% in VOO/VTI and 20% in VXUS/VEA. I was hoping to show an alternative to that. I think that my alternative is pretty performant while minimizing drawdowns. Again, I want to show people that there are options out there that are well worth a couple extra basis points in expense ratio and will more than pay for themselves. [deleted] What about 2020?

1mu4vhi,2025-08-19,"Anyone have a X to Y dip buying ratio?
Been thinking randomly about if there is a nice ratio of when a stock dips a certain amount you put in a certain amount and wondering if anyone does that?

Or do most people.just have it all in all the time?

Like GOOG or SPY or something you really Trust drops .5% you put in $50, drops 2% you put in $200. Assume the amount would differ by person and their means.

Cash could be savings, or skimming from profits in other ones (or margin if you're a crazy person) or your pot you like to keep.
This strategy doesn’t make sense because it doesn’t take into consideration how much the price has risen between dips. It could go up 20% while you wait for that 2% dip to make a significant buy. If it’s something you’re long on it’s better to just buy as much as you can as soon as you can. You can backtest this with some slippage to confirm your hypothesis Trying to create rules like this dont really make sense. The more rational approach is to estimate the fair value of a stock (not an ETF) and look to buy when it gets close. If it stays above the price, either your estimate is wrong or it is over priced and should be avoided anyway.  Are you aware of [swing trading](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swingtrading.asp)? Spy. I always buy every week and add daily buys (10% of what I buy weekly) when it’s greater than 10% down and then 2x that when greater than 20% down, 3x when greater than 30% down. Continue until run out of cash


Ill add that I never sell so it isn’t really trading I wasn't but this question is more a version of DCA/BuyTheDip This has already been studied, it is indeed better to lump sum… you’re missing out on gains by sitting on cash like this To me it sounds like you're describing an introductory version of swing trading: buy things that have recently gone down with the assumption they'll correct back upwards. Doesn't sound like something I have the courage to handle vs just DCA as much as fast as possible haha I’ve backtested this exact thought using pinescript. Not sure what wall you’re hitting, but Claude can probably get your backtest compiling properly in tradingview for you. 

Ther only strategy I was able to get working somewhat profitably was using ATR bands to decide when to purchase the dips and placing bracket orders to lock in both up side and down side. 

Even the profitable strategy gets stopped out of the trade most of the time, but the few winners were able to make enough to compensate for those losses.

You are now sitting at $330.
Meanwhile, a simple S&P 500 index fund ($VOO or $SPY) is up over 30% in that same period with none of the stress.
For the people who held through all of that: Was the mental stress worth it?

If you had an auto weekly you’d probably be ok. 

You should be doing that with VOO or QQQM. Harder to feel betrayed by indexes, pretty easy on single stocks. 

Learn the lesson. Or don’t. Could be worse. If you had purchased Adobe 4 years ago and continued to hold it you'd be down by over 40%.

  
Let's just say that I wish I didn't know this. You are literally saying “if you bought Tesla at the peak” you would have gotten nothing. For most companies buying at the top(after an insane rally) it doesn’t do crap. …and some of us bought 3 years prior to you and are sitting at a 1800% return. Sometimes time in the market trumps all. I agree. Most people shouldn’t lump sum though. They don’t have the emotional experience for it. They blow their wad, 5% pullback, they panic sell. Better to have a scalable long term plan. 

Buying auto sp500 is basically what 401k’s do, which tends to people’s largest accounts. They tend to make normal rookie mistakes in their self managed accounts. For index funds it is proven that lump sum beats DCA on average That company deserves to be way lower together with HP, the definition of enshittification. I'm going to take issue with the terminology here. 


It's not ""proven"".  It's just what has happened more often historically.


If you toss a coin a 100 times and get 52 heads, it's not ""proven"" that heads occurs more often. It's just what happened  It's also just a simple mathematical fact that if something goes up over time, putting more money in earlier will produce a greater return, *on average*.

DCA evens-out market fluctuations. Lower risk, lower reward. Diversification across time. “I’m still bullish on the stock long term but I don’t hold any right now.”

LOL!!  I know you’re serious, but this sounds like such a joke.  You are bullish…but you don’t hold any now… I think you’re less bullish than you think you are.",415,0.84,191,0,Diabitiz,investing,"['TSLA', 'SPY']",4 year tesla investing journey 0 return little sunday night chart review brutal bought tsla back early december 2021 paid 335 share held gutwrenching drop nearly 140 ignored noise held almost four years sitting 330 meanwhile simple sp 500 index fund voo spy 30 period none stress people held mental stress worth auto weekly youd probably ok voo qqqm harder feel betrayed indexes pretty easy single stocks learn lesson dont could worse purchased adobe 4 years ago continued hold youd 40 lets say wish didnt know literally saying bought tesla peak would gotten nothing companies buying topafter insane rally doesnt crap us bought 3 years prior sitting 1800 return sometimes time market trumps agree people shouldnt lump sum though dont emotional experience blow wad 5 pullback panic sell better scalable long term plan buying auto sp500 basically 401ks tends peoples largest accounts tend make normal rookie mistakes self managed accounts index funds proven lump sum beats dca average company deserves way lower together hp definition enshittification im going take issue terminology proven happened often historically toss coin 100 times get 52 heads proven heads occurs often happened also simple mathematical fact something goes time putting money earlier produce greater return average dca evensout market fluctuations lower risk lower reward diversification across time im still bullish stock long term dont hold right lol know youre serious sounds like joke bullishbut dont hold think youre less bullish think
1msvvdn,2025-08-17,"$ASPI - Bullish on USA JV deal to enrich Uranium in Texas
See previous post here (and at the very end) for why I'm bullish on ASPI [https://www.reddit.com/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/1ig7hqt/aspi\_discussion\_long\_6000\_shares/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/1ig7hqt/aspi_discussion_long_6000_shares/)

Upped my position to 12k shares prior to this latest release from the company: [https://ir.aspisotopes.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/75/asp-isotopes-inc-and-its-subsidiary-quantum-leap-energy](https://ir.aspisotopes.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/75/asp-isotopes-inc-and-its-subsidiary-quantum-leap-energy)



I don't see how the market didn't find this news favorable. Little shocked to see the stock sell off \~10% - but then again - it is basically a penny stock with only 3 analysts covering it. So large moves are pretty normal for these guys...

Signing a JV deal to start production of isotopes in the USA, in my opinion, is incredibly bullish. My only thought for the stock being down is maybe the latest news of Trump and Putin maybe getting along could actually be negative for the stock. This would be because Russia controls \~50% of the global uranium enrichment supply. And as we all know, Russia is blacklisted by the West right now, so no western allies can trade with Russia (at least for the most part) which is has added to the shortage of Uranium worldwide. There's a slight chance that Trump and Putin actually make peace and sanctions are lifted, but i HIGHLY doubt they lift sanctions on products/materials that are considered a national security risk (like Uranium/ HALEU/ Rare Earths/ etc.).

Anyways, I think this stock is just getting started. With a market cap under $1B this could EASILY 10x (i still personally believe 100x) if they can execute on enriching uranium to create HALEU. They would virtually be the only western commercial supplier of HALEU which is used to fuel most modern day nuclear reactors (SMR's). And I believe it is widely accepted nowadays that Nuclear power will be essential to generate enough power/electricity to power the AI revolution and data centers.

Worth taking a risk on this in my opinion. Thoughts?

Copied in my old post below where I got over my DD of the company from 7 months ago:

**TLDR:** If ASPI’s technology is truly what they say it is – this could be a 100x stock. Which wouldn’t be crazy given a $400M market cap currently (growing to $40B would be 100x). They could be one of the few Western providers of HALEU to fuel the West’s nuclear ambitions while deploying absurdly low capex. Not to mention potential revenue coming from the nuclear medicine and semiconductor fields (although I think the true homerun is with HALEU). However, if their technology isn’t as powerful as they say it is, this could be a true nothing-burger. Regardless, it is a bet I am willing to take. **Currently long 6,850 shares and looking to add more.**

**Bullish Points:**

• **Potential to Lower Isotope Costs**: ASP Isotopes has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of isotope enrichment through its proprietary Quantum Enrichment (QE) technology, which is more efficient and less expensive than traditional methods like centrifugation. The company's Aerodynamic Separation Process (ASP) is also comparable in efficiency to traditional centrifugation but at a much lower cost.

• **Countering Russian Dominance**: ASP Isotopes could help the West reduce its reliance on Russia for uranium supply, particularly for HALEU, which is crucial for next-generation reactors. This is especially important given geopolitical concerns and the US government's efforts to establish a domestic supply chain.

• **HALEU Fuel Production**: The company's technology is positioned to supply HALEU fuel for next-generation Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), which are expected to drive nuclear industry growth. ASP's technology could be a low-cost platform to enhance HALEU production. Costs could be as low at $10M to cerate a QE plant to enrich uranium as compared to traditional centrifugation which costs in the $Billions. This alone is – if the technology is truly legit – could be massively impactful for the company and the whole industry. I believe the CEO, Paul Mann, wants to spin out QLE (the portion of the business that will work on enriching Uranium (HALEU) for nuclear energy. Need to keep an eye on this and how exactly that will/would affect the mechanics of owning shares in ASPI. But either way for now, the nuclear business is wrapped up with $ASPI.

o   Per the company’s website: “ASPI recently entered into a Term Sheet with TerraPower LLC which contemplates TerraPower providing funding for the construction of a HALEU Facility and TerraPower purchasing HALEU produced at the facility.” TerraPower is a Bill Gates backed Nuclear company. So I would assume at least Bill Gates thinks ASPI’s technology is worth taking a risk on partnering on. This happened on 11/14/24 btw, so old news.

• **Diverse Isotope Applications**: ASP Isotopes' enrichment technologies can produce a variety of isotopes for use in nuclear energy, nuclear medicine, and semiconductors, offering diverse revenue streams. The company already has supply contracts in place for isotopes such as molybdenum-100, carbon-14, and silicon-28.

• **Vertical Integration**: With the acquisition of PET Labs, ASP Isotopes has the potential to become a vertically integrated radioisotope supplier, creating feedstock isotopes for its medical arm. I’m not sure how big of an opportunity this could be but they do produce YT-176 which is the isotope used by Novartis’s Pluvicto (prostate cancer treatment). Well technically I think they convert the YT-176 to YT-177 for treatment, but you get the point. For this drug alone reached \~$1B in 2023. ASPI announced construction of a YT plant on 9/3/24 according to their website.

• **Attractive Takeover Target**: If the company demonstrates commercial production at scale, it could become an attractive acquisition target for larger companies. I don’t invest hoping for a takeover, but given the small market cap of this company, (\~$400M at last check), any big-name utility or hyperscaler could easily buy them out just for their tech.

• **Proprietary Technology**: ASP Isotopes possesses two novel, proprietary enrichment methods: the Aerodynamic Separation Process (ASP) and Quantum Enrichment (QE). I’m not an expert on their technology of course, but I believe it is proprietary to them. Would love to hear more on this as the whole thesis hangs on them being different and being able to construct plants at very low costs (especially for HALEU).

• **Strategic Locations**: The company is expanding into Iceland, which is attractive for its low energy costs, regulatory support, and proximity to a major shipping port. They will also add plants in South Africa.

• **Government Support**: The US government is actively working to establish a domestic supply chain for nuclear fuel, which is a positive sign for ASP Isotopes. It does worry me that they aren’t a US company, but building in SA and Iceland for now would be considered friendly and the US could do business with them. We know this given TerraPower has begun working with the company.

• **Established Operations**: ASP has already commissioned a small-scale plant and has commercial contracts. For now, revenue is still miniscule, but hopefully this will change soon.

**Bearish Points:**

• **Commercial Scale Risk**: While the company's technology has been proven in the lab (so they claim), the ability to scale up to commercial production has yet to be demonstrated. There is a risk that the company will not be able to reach commercial scale after successful lab trials.

• **Political Risk in South Africa**: The company's operations in South Africa may be subject to political risk, including the potential for unforeseen curtailments around the proliferation of enrichment technologies. This risk also includes concerns about the ability to export isotopes from South Africa.

o   I’m also worried about a Trump administration for ASPI. I’m not sure if this will be beneficial for them or not. Nuclear is bipartisan (one of the only areas that Congress agrees on), and while normally I would think friendly relations with Russia/Putin would be a good thing for the USA and the world, if relations get too friendly, it is possible Trump opens up trade again with Russia. This would definitely hurt ASPI’s growth potential.

• **Regulatory Approvals**: ASP Isotopes needs to obtain necessary government approvals and permits in South Africa for HALEU production, as well as in other countries like Iceland and for other end markets. I think they will be able to do this, but honestly idk how government regs and approvals work.

• **HALEU Demand Risk**: The demand for HALEU fuel is dependent on the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approving HALEU-based SMRs, which is not yet a certainty. $SMR has an approved SMR but doesn’t really have any legit customers yet (I’m also long $SMR and $OKLO). I do think the NRC will give approvals but I am unsure about the timeline. But if approvals do come, ASPI is in a great position to be a Western provider of HALEU.

• **Balance Sheet/Liquidity Concerns**: The company may need additional capital to execute its ambitious growth plans. In fact that is probably a certainty that dilution is on the board in the future. Maybe they can get more contracts with customers who will partner and help fund some of the costs of capex, but who knows. That would also come with some sort of downsides like being locked into only selling HALEU to that customer/partner for a certain amount of time (like the TerraPower deal).

• **Competition**: While the company claims its technology is superior to traditional methods and has lower costs, it faces competition from existing players in the nuclear fuel and isotope enrichment industry. Again, not an expert on this, but figured I’d note it again as it came to mind and is a huge risk. 

• **Shorts Taking Aim**: Some group called “Fuzzy Panda” put out a short report in late Nov 2024 that rocked the stock (fell from $8 to $4 in like 2 weeks). While I think this anonymous group called “Fuzzy Panda” made a bag shorting this stock, and they do bring up a couple legitimate concerns, I ultimately think the stock will shake this off. TerraPower (backed by Bill Gates) gives me some hope that the company is legit. Regardless, the stock is in the cross-hairs of the shorts right now which will add to the volatility of this already volatile stock.

1msgofp,2025-08-17,"Buying put options to hedge against downside risk
Let me start off by saying, I have never traded options and have been an indexer most of my life. 

I have a pretty concentrated position of VFIAX / SWPPX in my taxable brokerage accounts, with most of my bond allocations in tax-deferred accounts for tax efficiency. 

I’m retired now, therefore no more DCA contributions and would love to have some protection for my inflated brokerage account without having to sell any of my stocks, which would trigger a bunch of LTCG taxes. I also don’t want to try and time the market even though so many indicators seem to suggest that the market is overvalued. 

Is buying put contracts, on say SPY / VOO, a good strategy to protect against this downside risk? 

Would appreciate some guidance from those who do this regularly or use a similar strategy - collar maybe!? Thanks!
In short, yes. It's actually what it was designed for. 
Many people think of options as gambling, but in this case you're buying insurance. And it's exactly like any other insurance. You pay a premium (that slowly decays to time - theta). 

If stocks move up or stay flat, you lose your premium (the cost of put) but you still got your positions. 

If stocks go down, you can either sell the put now worth a higher premium, or exercise your put and sell at the strike you selected when you bought the put.

Its the definition of a hedge. Its wealth preservation strategy which is what you're looking for. I don't like selling calls... because if the position drops, you only gain the premium of the call, it won't cover your losses the way a put would. 
If the stock rises, you just limited your gains and now you have a taxable event as your shares hey called away. What is your income?  If it's low enough, you can book some of those LTCG on the taxable side tax free.  If that's teh case, you should do so every year you can - even if  you just put it right back in the same index. BOoking those gains to raise your basis and lower future taxes is huge. Or you can keep it out of the market and build up some dry powder to take advantage of any upcoming dips.

Options wise, I don't know enough to help you. I'll see what others have to say. Long puts can make sense as u/Doodl3s described. But a collar would be a lot more complicated if you are trying to hedge VFIAX/SWPPX positions.

A collar in your situation is a synthetic short futures construction. You can use a short combo instead - ie write an otm call and buy an otm put. But the same problem remains - you have to understand how to manage the short call leg. And if you have never traded options before - many brokers are not going to let you write any spreads with naked call legs.

If you use long puts - the usual challenge is choice of strike and expiration - that really will depend on your market thesis and/or hedging drag that you are willing to deal with - and that is a personal choice.

The other option is to use put debit spreads. That could possibly reduce the hedging drag and give you some downside protection. And it may give you slightly more flexibility. 

There are also some advanced techniques which can be used to leg into put spreads to reduce the debit expense and sometimes even for a credit. But that requires a bit more options experience. Retired, no more new cash coming in, and sitting on gains that feel way too risky to just leave unprotected, but also way too expensive to sell because of taxes. One bad mrket year could wipe out years of careful compounding, and you’ve got limited room to recver now. But going from indexing to options overnight is kinda like jumping into deep watr without knowing if there’s a current, you can hedge, but it's super easy to mess up sizing, timing, or costs, espcially with puts that decay fast if not timed right.

What's stressing you more, losing money in a dwnturn, or locking yourself into a protection strategy that eats away at returns if the market just, keeps drifting up like it usually does? You could buy some long dated spy puts but it's expensive insurance. 

You could do spreads but that's more advanced.

You could also sell some shares, and use the cash collateral to sell OTM cash secured puts if you want to de-leverrage without totally getting out of the market. Exactly what he said, I use selling calls instead but it’s for the same outcome and yields a similar hedging result Fwiw - selling calls in OP's case isn't appropriate because it's a lot more complex. The calls would be naked because OP hold's mutual funds. And many investors do not know how to manage naked calls even if the naked calls are backed by another instrument. All good reasons to buy puts instead, don’t disagree As a strict value investor, I don't do the options trading thing, because by definition options trading is super risky right out of the gate, so to speak.

What I do to lower downside risk when buying equities is to calculate intrinsic values using very conservative future estimates of growth, when I run discounted cash flow models. And, I also use relatively large margins of safety, as Benjamin Graham taught.

This approach allows one to sleep quite comfortably at night. ☺️☺️☺️☺️",0,0.36,11,0,FriendlyTiger3676,investing,['SPY'],buying put options hedge downside risk let start saying never traded options indexer life pretty concentrated position vfiax swppx taxable brokerage accounts bond allocations taxdeferred accounts tax efficiency im retired therefore dca contributions would love protection inflated brokerage account without sell stocks would trigger bunch ltcg taxes also dont want try time market even though many indicators seem suggest market overvalued buying put contracts say spy voo good strategy protect downside risk would appreciate guidance regularly use similar strategy collar maybe thanks short yes actually designed many people think options gambling case youre buying insurance exactly like insurance pay premium slowly decays time theta stocks move stay flat lose premium cost put still got positions stocks go either sell put worth higher premium exercise put sell strike selected bought put definition hedge wealth preservation strategy youre looking dont like selling calls position drops gain premium call wont cover losses way put would stock rises limited gains taxable event shares hey called away income low enough book ltcg taxable side tax free thats teh case every year even put right back index booking gains raise basis lower future taxes huge keep market build dry powder take advantage upcoming dips options wise dont know enough help ill see others say long puts make sense udoodl3s described collar would lot complicated trying hedge vfiaxswppx positions collar situation synthetic short futures construction use short combo instead ie write otm call buy otm put problem remains understand manage short call leg never traded options many brokers going let write spreads naked call legs use long puts usual challenge choice strike expiration really depend market thesis andor hedging drag willing deal personal choice option use put debit spreads could possibly reduce hedging drag give downside protection may give slightly flexibility also advanced techniques used leg put spreads reduce debit expense sometimes even credit requires bit options experience retired new cash coming sitting gains feel way risky leave unprotected also way expensive sell taxes one bad mrket year could wipe years careful compounding youve got limited room recver going indexing options overnight kinda like jumping deep watr without knowing theres current hedge super easy mess sizing timing costs espcially puts decay fast timed right whats stressing losing money dwnturn locking protection strategy eats away returns market keeps drifting like usually could buy long dated spy puts expensive insurance could spreads thats advanced could also sell shares use cash collateral sell otm cash secured puts want deleverrage without totally getting market exactly said use selling calls instead outcome yields similar hedging result fwiw selling calls ops case isnt appropriate lot complex calls would naked op holds mutual funds many investors know manage naked calls even naked calls backed another instrument good reasons buy puts instead dont disagree strict value investor dont options trading thing definition options trading super risky right gate speak lower downside risk buying equities calculate intrinsic values using conservative future estimates growth run discounted cash flow models also use relatively large margins safety benjamin graham taught approach allows one sleep quite comfortably night
1mscnob,2025-08-17,"Help me to understand the differences between GOOG and GOOGL & Starmine Analyst ratings.
My inderstanding is that GOOGL is the original full voting rights google shares, and GOOG are pretty much exactly the same thing but without voting rights.  Every explanationI've read on this tells me that for this reason GOOGL should be slightly more expensive that GOOG.   As a small investor voting rights are pretty much irrelevant to me.

Yet at Fridays close, GOOGL closed at 203.90 and GOOG at 204.91.   Ok, thats not a huge difference, but it's in the opposite direction I would expect.

Then looking at Starmine analyst ratings I see that GOOGL is rated 8.2 - Bullish, yet GOOG is 6.9 -Neutral.  Should not both stocks have pretty much the same rating?

Truly the next Buffet You're rather behind on this: r/ValueInvesting has talked about it so much it became a meme, and this last week Berkshire Hathaway (and several other large investors) announced a significant position in the company, after which the share price went up. 

If you want to just follow behind Warren Buffet you can do that, but you'll get better results buying brk/b than attempting to duplicate his trades at worse prices. Why didn’t your tools say it was a good entry point last week before Berkshire bought? What’s your PT? i hope :D I haven't seen it, I'll keep an eye out for it. Pardon my ignorance, what’s “brk/b” They showed me, but I can't monitor all the promotions myself, so help me and we'll earn money together :) At a minimum, I expect the price to reach 400, which is about a 30% increase from current values. They are the class b shares of Berkshire Hathaway; the class a shares are very expensive and thus not appropriate for most people to buy.

Berkshire Hathaway, if you're not familiar, is a conglomerate business fronted by Warren Buffet, and known for being a long-lived and successful example of value investing.  Value investing in turn is a strategy of, in Warren's words, ""buying great companies at good prices"", with the idea that the company will continue to do well at business and the market price (for public investments) or cash flow (for private ones) will eventually come back up as other investors' irrational valuation corrects.",0,0.23,12,0,VladKlinkoff3,investing,"['AAPL', 'UNH']",one promising stocks august 2025 hello everyone today would like share next investment previously shared investment aapl yielded pretty good profit hope well time short buying unh unitedhealth group incorporated several reasons 1 stable profitable sector 2 price fallen quite bit earlier growth potential 3 good financial performance year last year 4 tools constantly use analysis shown good entry point free tools use 1 yahoo finance great analyzing financial statements indicators 2 free screener finding buysell signals stocks indices etc 3 ai analyzing news information specific stock entire sector hope information useful help someone please consider food thought rather financial advice everyone takes responsibility investment risks research truly next buffet youre rather behind rvalueinvesting talked much became meme last week berkshire hathaway several large investors announced significant position company share price went want follow behind warren buffet youll get better results buying brkb attempting duplicate trades worse prices didnt tools say good entry point last week berkshire bought whats pt hope havent seen ill keep eye pardon ignorance whats brkb showed cant monitor promotions help well earn money together minimum expect price reach 400 30 increase current values class b shares berkshire hathaway class shares expensive thus appropriate people buy berkshire hathaway youre familiar conglomerate business fronted warren buffet known longlived successful example value investing value investing turn strategy warrens words buying great companies good prices idea company continue well business market price public investments cash flow private ones eventually come back investors irrational valuation corrects
1mrf6u6,2025-08-16,"Should I be doing more in terms of investing?
24 years old. 80k salary in tech.

Recently started my 401k and investing in general 

I do $400 monthly in FXAIX and about $400 in individual brokerage. I just choose ones I like: Google Apple, PLTR, nvidia and stuff like that 

Also have about $200 in BTC. 

Thoughts? 
Based on the 80k income, that's about a 12% invested a year.  That's not bad.  If you can comfortably do more, it would increase the rate at which you compound.  Need to break out a spreadsheet ... I'd probably stick to indexes, but to be honest you're doing alright. If you keep doing this every year for the next 41 years a compound interest calculator set at 8% interest (can't predict this though - just a decent estimate) says that you'll retire with \~2.5 million. If that's alright with you then you're doing it right! I will reinforce that you should stick to indexes though, VT is tax advantage accounts and VTI+VXUS in around 7:3 ratios in non-tax-advantaged accounts (check out r/Bogleheads ). Set to automatic. Don’t rely on self discipline. Doesn’t matter if it is companies you like or sp500 or NASDAQ… you will eventually learn this. 

Only three numbers matter: monthly income vs monthly expenses vs monthly automatic investment. Do stuff on the side if you want, sure. Sell only when you have something urgent to pay for. 

But sounds like you’re doing great!! The idea here is that the investment are split in half between retirement and also accesible money that I don’t have to wait till 60 years old to use. Will increase 401k contribution as salary goes up I was reading some of the comments on here. If you are wanting to invest in a brokerage account along with your 401K, that’s totally fine. Some people don’t even have access to a 401K at their jobs, so they do Roth IRA and a brokerage. 

The most important thing here is that you are young and you’re saving/investing. Keep investing at least 15% of your salary every year, even more if you want to retire early. 

Your stock picks are fine too. 

If/when there is a stock market crash, you have more time to recover because you’re so young. When there is a crash, don’t worry about your balance (you will still own the same amount of shares). The best thing you can do is save even more during that time because you will be buying shares ‘on sale’. And then when the market recovers, your balance will shoot up. [https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/substantially-equal-periodic-payments](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/substantially-equal-periodic-payments)

There are ways to get access to your 401k value before the age of retirement that bypass the 10% early withdrawal penalty.  One of those ways is a SEPP. The thing with indexes is that they ARE diversity. Really diversity manifest. One big list of stocks you buy into. There's not just whole economy or world ones too though, something that may interest you is sector ETFs, ETFs that track a single sector e.g. VGT being a technology sector ETF. There's also equal weighted ETFs where every company has an equal share instead of a share based on valuation, like EQWS which is an equal weight for the Russell 2000 index! No. The heat death of the universe will surely be its limit IRA yes. 401K you should spread it out evenly across the year unless you understand how matching works and your company offers a true-up.

While I’m here, you work in tech and all of your investments are in tech. That’s a problem. Cool. If you max out contribution limits you could easily retire early, or at least be economically self-sufficient to do whatever else you want.

You're in good stuff for now, but if a real downturn happens next year, which is more likely every day, you may want to go into value stocks like Berkshire Hathaway BRKB. If there's a stock market crash, tech stocks will rebound more slowly than value ones. BTC would also crash pretty hard if the market drops and it would be hard to tell when it could regain value, especially since it's not based on anything tangible, just transactional utility and the perception of scarcity. Banks are the ones who create $ by issuing credit, so there's a limit to what BTC can do.

1mre505,2025-08-15,"Move TSP $ to IRA Question?
I’m considering moving $200,000 from my TSP into my Traditional IRA and then investing it 50/50 between SPYI and QQQI. That way I can begin reinvesting dividend payments immediately which would pay out nicely, potentially, in 10 years.

Alternatively, I could move the $200,000 into my IRA and then gradually convert portions into my Roth IRA each year, staying within the 32% tax bracket limit. My issue with this is I would lose out on a lot of money as I could only move $10-12k year at my current income rate

I just turned 50, prior military and hope to retire in 10 years?
You don't have dividend reinvestment in a TSP?

1mr9s2g,2025-08-15,"Index Fund Investing Question
Just finished watching Hank Green's video on how he is changing his investing (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZMFp-mEWoM) and wanted to get your thoughts on it. Mainly, I am interested in his point of the top 10 companies of SP500 (FXAIX for me) index funds representing 40% of the fund. Of that 40% there is a lot of tech exposure (NCDA, MSFT, AAPL, META, AVGO, GOOGL).

Total Market index funds (ex. FSKAX) has the identical top 10 holds that make up 33% of the portfolio. Would it be prudent to add mid cap/small cap index funds or international for diversification?

Curious to get your thoughts on this!

  
Edit: forgot to mention that my portfolio is currently not just held in SP500. My portfolio is 80% Total market, 15% or so international and the 5% bonds 
It has _always_ been prudent to diversify into mid caps, small caps, and other countries; that's true no matter how big the top companies in the S&P 500 are. Since your U.S. exposure is total market, you already have small/mid-cap exposure. You don't need to add it. However, I would consider going up to at least 20% on the international side. Consider reviewing this discussion.

* https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1mmdap4/what_does_rbogleheads_think_of_hank_greens_new/ I think some people care too much about it.  They're the top because they have the largest market cap.  If other companies had higher market caps they would be higher.

If you want to do more of an equal weighting to help with your goals of diversification, then there are funds for that, but based on what I remember from previously looking at them (granted I probably only looked at one), over the long term they underperformed in comparison.  Do you get more diversification?  Probably.  Would you also potentially be capping your upside potential?  Maybe. International will be the most effective diversification as it has the lowest correlation with U.S. stocks of the options you mentioned.  

But it also depends what risk(s) you want to protect against, which you haven’t said specifically. This is a great point. Thanks for adding perspective. It becomes a trade off... What's the best way to do this though? Mid cap and small cap indexes?

1mr24xw,2025-08-15,"Do ETFs do anything for me that I couldn't do myself?
Just calculated that I'm paying $1263 per year in ETF expenses. I'm not thrilled with the idea of keeping hundreds of different tickers in my brokerage... but I could probably put up with it for an extra $100/mo.

The ETFs that I hold are already pretty 'low cost' (spy, rsp, vt, schd). Are they doing anything for me that I couldn't, at least theoretically, do myself? I can see what each of them hold and in what proportions. Do they get better order fills? Would I have more slippage when I rebalance periodically to match them? 
[deleted] I can all but assure you whatever you pick-up in fees will be offset in execution costs when there are index reconstitutions or rebalancing -- I don't mean your time, I just mean spread on trades. And if you're investing out of a taxable account, you're also going to lose out on the tax efficiency of the etf structure itself. No, you couldn't rebalance thousands of stock holdings yourself.  

If you can't understand that $1263 is very welcome, happy expense to pay, I don't know what can be said. Switching from SPY (9.5 basis points) to VOO (3 basis points) would help and would be an easy place to start.  You could approximate some of this yourself, but is it really worth all that work on a portfolio likely worth over $1M?  Seems like a small return on something that requires a lot of work.  Do you really want to buy the entire S&P 500 individually?  Or do all the selling and buying when the index changes? 

I am also assuming this is in a tax-preferred account, since cashing out and eating all these capital gains in a tax account makes no sense to save less than 10 basis points.

I would (again in a tax-preferred account) switch from SPY to VOO but probably nothing else. >The s&p500 only updates once/quarter, averaging about 7 company changes per update. $315/quarter for 15 minutes of clicking seems worth it to me.

Most people are also buying more stock throughout the year, and rebalancing against other asset classes, both of which would add significantly more work. There’s are numerous benefits with ETFs that would be extraordinarily hard to replicate with individual trades.

1) Cost - building a basket of individual stocks to mirror the indexes listed above would likely be more expensive than what you’re paying now. ETFs have authorize participants executing trades in huge blocks with incredibly small margins. Even if you weren’t paying commissions on your trades the poor execution you’d be getting on each trade due to payment for order flow (PFOF) would cost you much more than your current 0.1% annual expense ratios.

2) Portfolio Management - Properly mirroring four index funds and trading each position frequently enough to mirror performance would be a logistical nightmare. 

3) Taxation - ETFs are able to defer capital gains until the ETF is sold. Buying the positions individually doesn’t get that same benefit and you would realize the gains / losses of the positions you’re trading.

If you’re looking to reduce expense ratios I would encourage you to find similar ETFs with a lower expense. (i.e. swap VOO for SPY), rather than try to build them yourself. That sounds like it would lag the heck outta Robinhood. Could just choose a Fidelity Zero mutual fund like FNILX.  Or BKLC if you need an ETF. Is this a shitpost? Anyone with this much money doesn't have the kind of time on their hands to upkeep stocks individually. That being said, VOO has 1/3 the expense as SPY and would be a easier way to cut costs.

1mr1vo1,2025-08-15,"Where do you stand on Warren Buffett after the purchase of UNH?
I've always been conflicted on Warren Buffett. I see him as a fatherly figure who is very pleasant and sociable, unlike Charlie Munger who is crude. He is also caring because he is giving away 99% of his wealth to charities. He takes but then gives (almost) all of it back. This suggests a man of great talent and great character.

The problem is that he sometimes profits from people's vulnerabilities and promotes unhealthy lifestyles. Companies like Coca Cola and now UnitedHealth. This suggests that he doesn't care about people !!

Now I am beginning to think that if you want to pursue greatness, you cannot avoid engaging in some evil. Whether you're a politician, a businessman, or an investor where your decisions affect a great number of people, you will have to exploit people to make a gain. There's no avoiding it unless you want to be broke.
[deleted] Don't know much about the investors. In terms of morality, invest in whatever you think will make you rich or financially independent. Once you reach that goal, you will have the power to do whatever you want, turning the market towards a moral path or just keep getting richer.

I think there's a scene in Games of Thrones where one of the protagonists, John Snow, was questioning the morality of his platoon. His captain advised, ""A good leader must first learn to obey"" (or something like that). Once he reaches a commanding rank, he can lead however he likes. But until then, he must respect the commands of his superiors without questions.

The point is you just have to know the rule of the game, abide by it, until a point where people can't question you, as in when you're rich enough.

As for United Health, coming from a medical field, you may better invest in tobacco and gasoline industries. Health is in their name, but they're anything but healthcare related. It may make you rich as an investor, but if you're its member, no miracle doctor can save you when it denies treatments because it's more profitable for you to die then it paying for a cure. Their CEO was killed for a reason. I'll just leave at that. Honestly a bit disturbing.   Health insurance exists to prevent healthcare.  It's a middleman that serves little purpose other than enriching the wealthy at the expense of the needy.

I've thought about selling my BRK.B this morning because of that.

""It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you'll do things differently."" - Warren Buffett

Buffett might want to think about this one differently.   Some businesses aren't just businesses. Greed is a moral imperative if you want to do charity. Buffett pretty much mirrors my own belief on investing:  invest in the best opportunities for risk-adjusted growth, even in industries that some find morally questionable, and then use the profits for “good” to benefit the causes you believe in.  If you don’t profit from legal but possibly immoral companies and industries, someone else will and may not want to be altruistic with the gains. You can have your own opinions on it, but Buffet is very straightforward in my opinion, that the investing activities are completely separate from the philantrophy.




Buffet sees investing as a pure profession. He is not an activist investor that buys into a company to make them reduce CO2 emissions or some other goal. He is just a business outlook and financial statements guy. He goes at it as a job like a welder, a football player, a nurse.





The welder doesn't only weld in moral projects, he welds oil rigs and missile components as well. Doesn't mean he doesn't donate to Greenpeace on his own  time. The football player doesn't hold back because the guys in the othe team are nice people, but that doesn't mean he can't volunteer to tutor kids. A nurse doesn't clean your wound better or worse depending if you save stray dogs as a volunteer or work in a repo business.





Buffet does the business as a pure profit making endeavour. Then when he clocks out, he donates or supports causes.
And keep in mind Berkshire is a fiduciary of shareholders interests, Buffet is there to make money not support his favorite causes. With his own time and money he supports those causes. They will benefit from this purchase because creditors will lend them money at lower rates ESG thinking like youre doing just creates a higher discount rate for someone else, who will take that free increased return while you over-allocate to something more aligned with your moral tastes.

This is pure business, I bought UNH on the drop as well. Just because the US gov is cutting healthcare now doesnt mean its going to be in the future. My healthcare provider *is United*. I know how shitty Optum (their subsidiary) is, how shitty their claims approval is. Thats a clear sign to me how good they will be at driving profits, so its a good investment. I think it was and is oversold. That's  a valid opinion to have, I am just saying for Buffet is seems quite clear how he sees it and why to him there is no contradiction.




I don't know how it is in the US, but at least in Europe, especially the Nordics, the asset management industry has a large variety of ESG oriented investment funds that are curated specifically to only invest in more moral, sustainable businesses and wouldn't include any company involved in scandals, military industry, big CO2 emmiters, etc.




Maybe something like that would be good for you, they are basicaly ETFs that remove the companies they think have a negative impact.

This is an example, there are several:


https://www.nordeafunds.com/en/sustainablility/esg I would equate my use of ""gaining social credit"" to your use of ""living a moral life and making good decisions"" in this context.  I see NVDA. Someone else may see it as a producer of hardware that enables AI which will destroy our way of life ( it may ) and consume all our electricity on the way. 

While I wouldn't invest in illegal drug cartels if they had a ticker, pretty much anything with a ticker is fair game for investment to me.  I cannot either fix or ruin the world with my puny portfolio and I am not going to avoid good investments because doing so makes me feel good about myself. I feel good about my personal acts, not the acts of others.

1mr00ju,2025-08-15,"Consolidating my portfolio
Hello folks,

Apart from SPY and BRK.B, I also own 10 individual stocks. I used to own QQQ, but I decided to sell all of it and pick my own tech stocks instead. 

I was thinking of keeping them to a minimum, but I have now 10 individual stocks. I think it’s too much and I want to consolidate and have like 5-6 instead.

What would you sell (from this list) and what would you buy (preferably from this list, because I wanna decrease the number of stocks) using the proceeds from the sales:

AAPL
AMZN
CRWD
GOOG
META
NBIS
NFLX
NVDA
SMCI
SOUN
I used to DCA into Microsoft for close to 2 years. Got out cause I was breaking even. I don’t wanna sell one and buy another. I wanna sell one and put the money into others in the same list. It’s hard to individually manage 10 stocks MSFT is possibly more diversified and rooted than any of those, even if it is not very sexy for average joe. AMZN is the only one close. I’m surprised it is not in your list. Why sell at all? Just acquire more in whatever “pivot” you want… set a weekly buy and work to increase the weekly. 

If you sell for reasons other than needing the cash to pay for something urgent, you’re likely making a mistake. 

15 years from now, you can go back and look at what your sold shares would be worth had you just left them alone. 

Warren Buffet says he would be 100 times richer had he simply never sold. He considers himself the worst trader ever. 

The difficulty you’re running into is exactly why it is easier to just set an auto buy for VOO or QQQM. You will tinker with your “recipe” you won’t focus on the import thing: spend less, acquire more, let compounding happen unmolested You could consolidate down to a single fund while vastly increasing diversification (and thus, reducing uncompensated risk).

But you've decided that you want to pick individuals rather than use a fund. Whatever drove that decision should drive this one. Get FNGS...

1mqyb1f,2025-08-15,"Those of you still on the sidelines, does Buffett and BRK moving cash into the market make you more willing to get back in too?
Let me start by saying there is another discussion on the UNH and NUE purchases, that's not my question specifically.

My question is, Buffett has disclosed that BRK has deployed substantial capital in purchasing these 2 positions, I've seen many people post here in the past that BRK's huge cash stockpile and him being the oracle of Omaha, that indicated retail investors to be cautious. So is this now the ""green flag"" for you to get back in?
Let's keep this in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway just unveiled four new purchases of approximately $3.3 billion in total. That's a lot for you and me, but that's nothing for him. And at the end of last quarter Berkshire had $344 billion in cash. 

That's roughly the equivalent of somebody with $1,000 in the bank spending $8. It's nothing. Because they think the specific companies they purchased are underpriced. They aren't buying SPY. [deleted] He’s not moving cash into the market, they’re holding more cash than ever. The fact he’s buying some things is offset by sales of apple and Bank of America. Their net invested position isn’t changing substantially positive I am not on the side lines but one thing I really hate when people say stuff like ""Buffet is holding a record amount of cash "" and use that as an excuse to wait to invest or imply he is predicting a recession or what ever is, at the same time Berkshire is holding a record amount of cash , they are also holding a record amount of equities.

So the another head line could very well be like ""Berkshire grows their equity holdings to a new record high"" and both headlines would be true. Just depends what narrative you want to push Apologies, I should have clarified this was addressed mainly to those who live in the US. Because Berkshire thinks it can do better with those stocks. 

Regardless, if anyone out there is sitting in cash and using this as justification for getting back in, a) they’re probably a terrible investor b) There are worse reasons to buy. Their net cash has gone up. Some of that will be profits… but not all of it. Regardless of how they’re shuffling money around they haven’t dumped a ton of cash into stocks… so their buys have to be roughly equal to sales net… that doesn’t sound like a ringing endorsement of the market If you're getting into UNH then sure.

1mqqecd,2025-08-15,"Are we in an AI bubble?  Share your thoughts!!

Pretty much the same as the title, I personally own$META, $AMD,  $NVDA and $TSM.   It’s been a wild ride since last year.  Especially $AMD, went from a dead horse to one of my most profitable trades ever.   However , as an investor, the risk of those holding are getting higher as the market (especially in semi) is getting overheated (imo).  I just want to get a general consensus on how far this AI train will go.  

Thank you for your time and input.



It is very highly probable we are in an AI bubble roughly comparable to the dotcom bubble. Most AI investments have yet to turn any profit. Consumers don't want neither AI enabled products nor AI in customer service. AI had become synonymous with slop and poor quality. What you miss completely is that most large companies like Google are mostly immune to AI crashing. They have record profits without AI and AMD is leading the non-AI data center with Threadripper CPUs crushing Intel's traditional market. Also remember that large tech behemoths like Meta and Google is what emerged from the dotcom bubble. Same could happen as AI had its niches but nowhere near what the current craze that is happening. ""AI is the single biggest advancement since the internet and personal computer"" isn't mutually exclusive with AI being a bubble. Internet literally had its own bubble ... out of it survived the profitable companies. Many fell.. Wow what a broad research you clearly has made. What happens to these companies when they realize AI isnt generating money for them? What happens to NVDA revenue? Yawn Following this logic the dotcom bubble should have never happened because the internet was ""the single  biggest advancement"" of the IT revolution at the time and the world was barely scratching the surface and its wide adoption in late 1990s.

You're mixing up a technology's potential with the justification for inflated asset prices. This is a dangerous mistake to make in investment. In fact, this fundamental sentiment was a key driver of the dotcom bubble itself. I think we’re in a bubble but I think it’s much smaller than people think. We assume it will pop and be a several year drop like the dot com crash, but I think it will be more comparable to the 2022 correction. That doesn’t mean the bubble can’t get bigger and cause a massive crash in the future, but I think we need more of a frenzy for speculative small cap companies to get to that place. Either way, a few years after there will be an even larger boom once the real impact of AI takes hold. No. AI is the single biggest advancement since the internet and personal computer. We are barely scratching the surface at this point. People doubting will sound like people who loved the fax machine shortly. I've used AI a few times. And Google insists as spitting it at me. It's neat sometimes and annoying at other times. Wouldn't pay a dime for it, though, and couldn't care less if it fucked off the planet tomorrow. 

It's like the few times I used a VR headset. ""So cool! I don't want this, though!""

Hopefully, companies aren't relying on me for any fractional percentage of their monetization strategy. Are you telling me that printing out a meme at a friends house is still not considered revolutionary I’m in tech and work for one of the big public post-startups. AI is literally changing everything we do and is making our lives 10x easier. Systems problems that we would never be able to fix without years of IT work and internal battles we are fixing in a couple of sprints with a handful of developers. 

The rate we can make content and tools is truly mind blowing. 

We either get on board now or get left behind. I’m very bullish, despite me rolling my eyes at almost all consumer uses for AI. They got a bump from AI hype, but they're not really AI stocks.

1mqhgy7,2025-08-14,"What’s the Take on Apple?
Why do I feel as if Apple may have lost an ability to remain super relevant in 20-30 years after not being competitive with AI? 

What if Google takes over the phone market due to Gemini integration; would assume it’s strategically advantageous in comparison to Apple if you don’t consider their relationship with Open AI.
The people who buy iPhones don't care about Google or Androids. They will continue buying the latest iPhone. No idea why you feel that way. As of today, AI on a phone is all hype and doesn’t do anything useful. AI has proven to be a big Capex suck with no corresponding ROI for every company that has jumped into it. Apple eventually will be proven correct for not going full bore in that direction. They'll just finance their phones over 3 years and make the economy even more overleveraged. Apple is never first to the game when it comes to innovation. They have huge room for growth in the AI space. With their huge cash pile, they could theoretically just acquire the assets they need for AI. 

I honestly wouldn’t bet against Apple. Extremely low debt, huge cash flow, growing services, possible new products in the future like a lower cost AVP or some other new product pipeline. Poor Americans have been struggling to buy iPhones for decades. It’s not like they only became poor last year.  Not only is there not a single company turning a profit on generative AI, there isn't a single company with a plan on how to turn a profit on generative AI Probably because you're believing the hype in the media that they're behind in AI. 

Apple have NEVER been a first mover, but they do regularly launch the best product in the category, because they refuse to ship shit. They didn't have the first computer, or MP3 player, or tablet, or wireless headphones, or smart watch but they generally dominate the market they enter when they've figured out how to do it right and it gets mass adoption beyond the nerds. If we're still talking about iPhones, you can only go so far.

Unfortunately Apple hasn't built a vertical that goes out of that realm much. 

It's Mac, iOS and wearables it's not exciting anymore. I’m never using an Android phone.

I have a Gmail account and use Google and Google Maps; I still use an iPhone, Air Pods, Apple TV device and Apple Watch.

* Berkshire added 5M shares of UNH in Q2
* Stock up significantly in after-hours trading
* UNH closed regular hours at $271.49, now trading at $296.45 AH

This move reinforces Buffett's strategy of investing in dominant companies with strong moats. UnitedHealth continues to be one of the largest positions in BRK's portfolio.

**What do you think? Smart move by Buffett?**
Shows even Warren can be early. Probably down on his position. He can be more patient than redditors can - he will hold through a dip to $150 if need be. The market overreacted and he pounced. He buys things that are down and doesn't try to time bottoms. Him buying 'early' suggests that the market overreacted - not that he overpaid. We won't see 230 again. We absolutely will, lots more skeletons to come out and medicare advantage plans are a disaster right now. 

He may not try to time bottoms but he put less than 1% of his port in it. This sub is putting 30% of their port in it. You are not the same. I hate this.

1mq7ago,2025-08-14,"Investment Experiment - S&P 500 vs Blue-Chip companies?
I would like to preface this post by saying I am a 22M engineer and actively contribute to savings, 401k and Roth IRA. I am wanting to run a personal investing experiment in my taxable brokerage. My general idea is to pick 10 blue chip stocks (preferably diversified betweeen tech, energy, industrials, consumer, etc.) and run them against an s&p 500 etf (voo, spy) and compare the results y-to-y. This is mostly for my own enjoyment as investing is my hobby, but I am looking for insight on how to select the companies more than just saying “oh it’s Microsoft of course it’s a good company”. My plan is to not touch the baskets in any circumstance, that is unless one of the companies dives to nothing and collapses. I would appreciate any advice, thank you.
> I am looking for insight on how to select the companies more than just saying “oh it’s Microsoft of course it’s a good company”

The thing is, to make this realistic, you need to be able to mentally go back to 'Year X' and ask yourself, what were the blue chip companies *at the time* and see how they then performed subsequently.

In the 80's or 90's the obvious choices might have been like... IBM, AT&T, Coca Cola, Exxon, maybe Kodak (?), stuff like that. Gotta have the mindset of someone at that time not knowing the future. Use a place like Fidelity or Robinhood that supports fractionals and buy on a weekly basis. At your age, it is not a bad idea to get you some super long term buy and hold. Some NVDA, some MSFT, AAPL.  Whatever you like. 

The majority of the auto should be VOO or QQQM, granted. But at your age, get you some companies you like. Best of luck young buck!! I would start making a list of qualities you find important in a company you're investing in.  Things like low corporate debt, good management, not in a volatile industry or region, aggressively moving into the future (no Kodaks), not making products with declining popularity, etc.  Then seek out companies that best meet your targets.

These can be your own criteria, or a mix of yours and advice from financial consultants who inspire your trust.  Even then it's a crapshoot - I chose not to buy TSM at $90 because of China/Taiwan volatility, and it's at $241 two years later. Well nice experiment..my guess is the results would be very erratic..diversity may not be good..I’ve found there are usually sectors to avoid I use Morningstar ratings (you need Premium, which is free at the library). Buy on a four or five, sell on a one or a two stars. That basically means buy when they are at a good value.

I did something similar decades ago not to compare the two but with a small amount of cash in a taxable brokerage to learn how markets work better. Been at it ever since as I enjoy doing the work it entails (which ain't that much, tbh).

1mq2dgj,2025-08-14,"Can someone tell me if I’m investing too much at the start?
Quick question. I have little to no experience investing but want to start with a fairly large chunk of my savings. The idea is that this money is just sitting in a high yield savings account and i figure why not use it to start investing for the future. Would it be a bad idea to take around 40k and split it up with 50% going into broad market ETFs like VOO and SPY, 20% going into value investing like SCHD and VYM and BRK.B, another 20% for broad growth such as QQQM and SCHG, and the last 10% going into higher risk tech companies such as SMH and AMD? The question is, is this too much money to go straight in with? I still have plenty enough for an emergency fund and zero high interest debt. 
It's never too much Without knowing your specific situation it’s probably not great to comment but your plan seems well considered No it’s not a bad idea at all, if your emergency fund can ensure you don’t tinker with your investment then dropping it all in wins vs DCAing 2/3 of the time. People can have different percentages. It's based on what you want and need, not what others are doing.  Just stick with VOO VT VTI.  Forget all the others. Ok, you have good advice on which investments. What or when are you investing for? Also, make sure you’re dialing in your lifestyle for regular contributions going forward. You seem to have your ducks in a row, but you want to set yourself up to be a regular investor for many years to come. So live below your means and invest as much as you reasonably can consistently over time.

Finally, spend some money to live your life too! My only regret is not spending more money on a motorcycle when I bought mine. Rode it for 10+ years. Should have bought a fancier one when I certainly could have afforded it (and still made my investments). Interesting. Ive also had someone tell me about VOOG. Thoughts? My emergency is about 4-5 months of expenses. It works out for me in case something goes wrong.

1mq0gb9,2025-08-14,"Are multi-vertical tech ecosystems (AI + Gaming + Fintech infra) the next big investment wave? A case study discussion.
Over the past few years, we’ve seen how companies that control *multiple, interconnected verticals* can create stronger economic moats than single-focus startups. Think of Tencent (games + payments + social), Amazon (retail + cloud + streaming), or even Apple (hardware + services + payments).

I’ve been following a new wave of companies building similar “ecosystems” in emerging industries particularly at the intersection of:

* **AI SaaS tools** (content generation, agents, automation)
* **Gaming/metaverse platforms** (immersive worlds with real economies)
* **Fintech-grade transaction infrastructure** (instant, low-cost settlement across platforms)
* **Owned social networks** for direct user retention & acquisition

The investment thesis is that each vertical strengthens the others:

* AI tools drive developer adoption in the gaming/metaverse space.
* Social platforms reduce customer acquisition costs.
* Payments infrastructure monetizes user activity without relying solely on ads or in-game purchases.

From an investor’s perspective, I’m curious how others are valuing companies that:

1. Already have multiple working products in different verticals.
2. Monetize not just the end-user product (like a game) but also the underlying infrastructure (like a DEX, payment rails, or AI platform).
3. Operate globally from day one.

In my view, the right execution here could create network effects similar to those that made Tencent and SEA Group attractive to investors years ago. But the risk profile is higher because you’re betting on multiple product categories at once.

**Questions for the community:**

* Do you see this “multi-vertical integration” as a moat or as a distraction for early-stage tech companies?
* How do you think such companies should be valued on a sum-of-the-parts basis, or on potential ecosystem synergies?
* Have you invested in, or tracked, any companies operating in this combined AI + Gaming + Fintech space?

I’d like to hear your thoughts and see if this is a space investors here are actively watching.
These non-ad ads are annoying.  Can you express your ideas on this using your own words? But the tools and tech stack don't matter imo. Whether something is technically possible or not doesn't really make a difference when it's still a question of building the audience/market/whatever, and you simply cannot predict that. Are you talking about startups or established tech giants? Because I don't see how you can talk about controlling multiple interconnected verticals as a startup. 

Roblox is the closest thing to what you're describing I can think of, but it's a good example of how you have to succeed first at one thing, then worry about spreading out to multiple verticals. Good point, giants like Tencent got there by building dominance in one vertical first. The interesting question for me is whether the current tech stack (especially AI + modular infra) makes it possible for smaller players to launch multiple verticals from day one without diluting focus. Roblox did it sequentially, but the tools available now are very different compared to when they started.

1mpdyuh,2025-08-13,"What to do with $200k in AMZN
I've acquired $200k of AMZN stock over the last 3 years. I haven't moved it around much, and I'm questioning what to do with it.

I know conventional wisdom is against holding most of your portfolio in one stock and diversification to protect against risk is the usual recommendation.

However, I'm having a hard time selling off part or most to put into something else when I see its 2, 5, 10 years gains are all 40%+. I look at VOO, which has great consistency with 15% gains over that time, but it's obviously not as good as AMZN has performed.

I know past performance does not equate to future gains, but I have a hunch AMZN has a lot of growth ahead with their investment in AI, robotics, satellites, etc. 

What would you do? Hold it all there, sell 50% and buy something like VOO, sell 75%...? Let me know, thanks.
[deleted] While I really like this thought process, it’s also wise to consider the tax implications and model out how many years of S&P over-performance you would need in order to come out ahead - since you’re at minimum losing 15% of your working capital to the tax man I would leave it for the time being, no hurry to move it. They are getting ready to launch their Starlink competitor to offer internet service in rural areas. Also, they are expanding same-day delivery to rural areas. Also, AWS continues to dominate, and is only getting  stronger. Also, from the perspective of the current administration, they kissed the ring last week through cost breaks to govt agencies. I would hold for 6 months and then re-evaluate. Highly diversified business. Conventional wisdom for the working class is don’t put all your eggs in one basket, but the executives who get paid in equity have absolutely massive holdings in the company they work for… for example my dads investment portfolio a few years out from retirement up until last year was about 50-60% stock in the company he was c-suite for. 25% was VTI and 25% is equity in a privately held company that he is a partner in that will likely go public in the next decade. Since he’s sold out of his previous company’s stock, he’s down to about 20% of his net worth in it. He’s moved it into CDs, SGOV, and JEPQ/JEPi to prep for retirement income. He also gets profit sharing from the company he’s partners in and will be at until retirement, then serve on the board as they go public.

Any way, point is this is how most executives of publicly traded companies go from rich to borderline obscene wealth. Huge holdings in the company they manage Job security is another part of this. Your dad is not at high of a risk of having his contract terminated AND having his stock portfolio drop 50% without some type of high-level compensation/severance.

1mp6n81,2025-08-13,"AMD on the move - this could easily move past ATH (15%+)


I’ve written extensively about AMD so I will keep it brief today as we just hit a breakout.

1. Leader in chiplet design (years ahead of Nvidia)

2. Will capture non-Nvidia demand from hyperscalers, sovereigns, and companies who value open-sourced and unit economics.

3. Rocm is quickly catching up to CUDA - latest 7.0 is 3x inference performance improvement.

4. P/E reasonable if you take out Xilinix amortization.

5. $300B market cap vs NVDA approaching $5T, more than Germany’s GDP.

Anything could move past ATH Or AMD disappoints with GPU sales and the stock plummets. We will see.

But as long as intel does not get it's shit together, AMD will probably thrive. Nvidia just delayed Rubin because they fear it's slower than MI400.  So, I think there's a lot going for AMD. Definitely undervalued. The news that Nvidia is delaying their product to better compete with AMD is a threat. AMD is a real competition! It will hit ATH then crash 30%. Have fun. With Intel drowning, it's probably an easier business move for AMD to try and steal the server/hyperscaler CPU market from Intel than it would be to try and catch Nvidia on the GPU side.

Everyone freaking over GPUs while the world still needs an endless supply of x86 CPUs Especially considering inflation Just advanced money destroyer things I’ll be angry at OP if that doesn’t happen Not MI400,they delayed it to match MI455 apparently.

1mp6fpt,2025-08-13,"90% of investment is in AAPL
My wife and I bought Apple and our cost basis is $28. We have roughly 24k earned from this investment. The growth has obviously slowed but it’s still paying dividends and is pretty safe but I want to continue to grow this aggressively. We really don’t have much for investments so I would like to use this money to help us get to a larger down payment on a new home. That larger down payment is $100k-$150k. 

I will be 40 in September. I make around $200-250k a year and I’m the only income for the household at the moment. Wife is finishing masters program that we are cashflowing. No outstanding debts besides our primary mortgage and we have nearly $500k in equity with, we plan to rent it once we have a down payment for new home. 2 kids in public school (age 6 and 8). I have a few retirement accounts in which I am contributing.

Happy to answer any questions. This is my first post hopefully I hit the common questions.

 
Sorry, is there a question in there? Or is this a Q&A? He makes 250k a year!
Just work a year and voila youre G He wants advice turning 24k into 150k I can't give you any advice turning 24K into 150k, if you're making 250k a year with no debt except the mortgage you should be able to save 150k pretty quickly I just sold my 200 shares of Apple after a 835% increase. I don't see Apple being as innovative as they have been over the last two decades. When did cap gains tax become 25%? Should only be 15% for his income If you're thinking about buying a second home - why? You've got one with equity and presumably a lower rate than today. I live in Seattle, and won't touch the housing market with a 10ft pole here, mainly due to the rent price/mortgage disparity and very expensive labor. Couple all of that to your situation, where you want to become a landlord - if you are in the Seattle area have you looked at how tough tenants rights make it to be a landlord? No thank you I'll just take the SPY returns instead. 

I'd be more inclined to understand the motivation for getting a new house and wanting to become a landlord versus selling 24K of AAPL. How diversified are you in retirement accounts? How much do you have in retirement? You're going pretty heavy on WA real estate, in a market where I'm not so sure it'll have remotely the same growth over the next decade as tech layoffs and hiring impact how many people move here compared to the last 10. I’m not understanding what you mean by “we have roughly 24k earned from this investment”.  Does this mean the market value of the investment or the dividends paid from this investment.
 
I am also not understanding what you are trying to achieve - continue to grow the investment via DRIP or use the money for a larger down payment. So you are saying you bought Apple back around 2015 and have made 24k off of all of it? So you invested around 2400 at that time? And this is 90% of your portfolio? You have a lot of income.

1mp2jtl,2025-08-13,"Robinhood beneficiaries options
I have some money in Robinhood in both Roth IRA and Traditional IRA. Today I went to set beneficiaries and the options are not very appealing.

For example, it won't give me the option to set a ""primary beneficiary"" and a ""contingent one"", you can only set primary. Also it won't accept minors as beneficiaries so your children won't inherit your assets in case something happens to you and your wife?

This is really making me think about leaving Robinhood for good, is there a workaround? Maybe calling so I can add my family as beneficiaries of all my assets? Are they working on this? Anything?
My god, people that think they know are destroying the world!

FYI: In Schwab my wife is the primary beneficiary while my daughter (which is only two years old) is the contingent beneficiary. Further, if the worst happens theirs children will inherit. 

This is normal and I'm not the first one to comment about how Robinhood handles beneficiaries, lot's and lot's of people find it super weird. Please, go with your BS somewhere else since I'm pretty sure I know how these things work! I think your best option is to create an actual will. Time to join a big kid brokerage. 
Not worth the call. Takes less time to open a Schwab account and transfer assets over. Can also do the same in Chase App. 

Congratulations. You’ve graduated my friend.  Wait what?

Most of my money is in Schwab already but I prefer Robinhood to day trade and play with my IRAs (tax free), that's why I have the IRAs in Robinhood. Not to mention Robinhood gives you 3% on contributions, etc.

Not sure what you mean by graduated but thanks? Yeah, that would be a solution. A lot cleaner to have beneficiaries directly on IRAs vs. passing through the estate via will.

Does the money have to come out of the IRA to pass through the will? If so, the beneficiaries lose the option to keep money in inherited IRA for up to 10 years.

It is generally recommended to name individual beneficiaries for IRAs to avoid the complexities and potential disadvantages of having the IRA pass through the estate. IRAs are tax free everywhere. Schwab has Thinkorswim, which is far better for day trading than anything Robinhood offers. Get a lawyer and create a will. Your accounts will follow the distribution of your will over anything else. You get 3% match on contributions with the max being 210. Net of cost for the account it’s $150. 
Each match is dated to the contribution it comes from and the wait is 5 years. 

There are plenty other institutional promotions that have free brokerage IRAs and will pay you to shift your relationship over. 

If you value being able to be flexible with your estate planning and want the accounts linked to a firm with professionals that know how to handle assets to your beneficiaries, the legacy firms do a great job. 

As for the advice about getting a will and speaking to an estate planner… take that with a grain of salt. A will still requires you to name an executor. The executor is rarely checked on the handling of your assets after you die. 
Best instruction is one where you name beneficiaries. That is a free trust to designate your assets to a particular person with no probate involved. 

If you’re asking questions about beneficiaries and contingent beneficiaries, then you’ve graduated from Robinhood.  this doesn't have anything to do with robinhood, it has to do with your misunderstanding how inheritance works.  no brokerage will allow you to appoint a minor as a beneficiary.  the only way you can do this is in a will, where you name the minor as the beneficiary and appoint a custodian to manage the account until they are of legal age (18).

  
when you name multiple beneficiaries most brokerages wont support it, because upon death it means creating several subaccounts and re-assigning legal ownership of them, again nothing specific to robinhood.

it sounds like you want to consult an estate attorney.  moving out of robinhood is a good idea on the merits, because its a crappy brokerage, but for your specific usecase, you'll find the same frustrations if you moved to schwab, fidelity, vanguard, etc.",0,0.5,10,0,jvillasante,investing,['CCEP'],robinhood beneficiaries options money robinhood roth ira traditional ira today went set beneficiaries options appealing example wont give option set primary beneficiary contingent one set primary also wont accept minors beneficiaries children wont inherit assets case something happens wife really making think leaving robinhood good workaround maybe calling add family beneficiaries assets working anything god people think know destroying world fyi schwab wife primary beneficiary daughter two years old contingent beneficiary worst happens children inherit normal im first one comment robinhood handles beneficiaries lots lots people find super weird please go bs somewhere else since im pretty sure know things work think best option create actual time join big kid brokerage worth call takes less time open schwab account transfer assets also chase app congratulations youve graduated friend wait money schwab already prefer robinhood day trade play iras tax free thats iras robinhood mention robinhood gives 3 contributions etc sure mean graduated thanks yeah would solution lot cleaner beneficiaries directly iras vs passing estate via money come ira pass beneficiaries lose option keep money inherited ira 10 years generally recommended name individual beneficiaries iras avoid complexities potential disadvantages ira pass estate iras tax free everywhere schwab thinkorswim far better day trading anything robinhood offers get lawyer create accounts follow distribution anything else get 3 match contributions max 210 net cost account 150 match dated contribution comes wait 5 years plenty institutional promotions free brokerage iras pay shift relationship value able flexible estate planning want accounts linked firm professionals know handle assets beneficiaries legacy firms great job advice getting speaking estate planner take grain salt still requires name executor executor rarely checked handling assets die best instruction one name beneficiaries free trust designate assets particular person probate involved youre asking questions beneficiaries contingent beneficiaries youve graduated robinhood doesnt anything robinhood misunderstanding inheritance works brokerage allow appoint minor beneficiary way name minor beneficiary appoint custodian manage account legal age 18 name multiple beneficiaries brokerages wont support upon death means creating several subaccounts reassigning legal ownership nothing specific robinhood sounds like want consult estate attorney moving robinhood good idea merits crappy brokerage specific usecase youll find frustrations moved schwab fidelity vanguard etc

You're not going to have that luck buying it now, but at a quick glance I see that 65 analysts still rate it a ""strong buy.""  My advice: jump in with both feet.

That said, there are a lot of good mutual funds with large positions in the stocks you mention.  Maybe better diversification in places like SWPPX, QQQ, or IOO?

1mogaie,2025-08-12,"Need help finding treasury bonds to invest in
Not sure where to start..did some googling but can't find a whole list of mutual treasury bonds. I just want to invest in regular, standard bonds. No etfs, no muncipal etc..

Also if anyone knows a good amount to invest depending on the length of the bond? For example how much should I invest in a 20 year bond opposed to a 1 year bond? Let's say I only have a hypothetical $5k for both situations.
Any major brokerage supports buying treasury bonds.

There is no different amount for 20 year vs 1 year.  You could buy $50M of 1 year t-bills or $1k on 20 year treasury bonds.

The length of time should match your time horizon.  When do you need this money.  If you need it in 5 years then a 20 year bond is a terrible idea. You might be confusing terms.


Mutual Funds are investment pools. They can hold stocks, bonds, etc. Perhaps you're thinking of a bond Fund? 


You can buy bonds directly. I use Treasury Direct. I buy Bills and Notes. Pick your date to maturity, invest amounts, pick for instance, $2500 and 2 different auction dates, or maybe a 3 month and a 1 month. Set them both to automatically renew. If you need money, you can set the next renewal to 0 and it matures and cashes out. 


Or, you can buy on the secondary market through your broker. That includes private and municipal placements, public project, special purpose such as housing authorities, etc.  SGOV Don't use treasury direct.  Just use your brokerage. Bonds can easily be found on the major broker websites for purchase on the secondary market. 

If you have 5k total, or even 10k, I could envision buying 1 treasury bill/note each year for the next 5 or 10 years.  In other words,  ladder them.  Plan to hold them to maturity, then add again at the long end. You sound exactly like someone that should just use an ETF lol.  Use SGOV, set to dividend reinvestment. Go on with your day.

1moaxk5,2025-08-12,"Need Advice: Managing $450k Trust for My Mother’s Long-Term Care
Hi everyone,

I (M, 31) recently became the sole trustee of a trust for my mother (F, 60). The trust is currently worth about $450,000. I have some investing experience, but nothing on this scale or for this phase of life and I want to make sure I manage it responsibly for her long-term benefit.

Background: 
- My mother is in decent health, though she has some chronic conditions (currently managed and covered by Medicare).
- She doesn’t need , nor does the trust require minimum distributions.
- She lives in a fully paid-off tiny house on my property. It’s safe, secure, and close to family. I cover about $350/month in upkeep, which is manageable for me.
- She is happy with the life she has. 
- In 10 years, if the trust is at a good place for future care, I’d like to use moderate and responsible distributions to enhance her quality of life, for her to travel or do whatever else she wants in her golden years.
- I did not choose to be the trustee, I accepted my mother’s request, but this type of management is a little beyond me so I am getting as much advice as I can.  Both on Reddit and multiple advisors in the real world. 

Goal:
- I believe that I need to grow the trust from $450k to $1.1–1.2M+ to reasonably have a chance to cover the costs  for long-term care or nursing home costs without depleting it entirely. Ideally, I’d like for this to be completed by her early 70’s. 

Additionally, My career is still getting established, but I hope that in over the next 10 years to be able to cover larger costs myself without tapping into the trust prematurely. 

Current steps I have taken: 
- Secured a CPA and assessed 2025 tax liability (there is next-to-none this year) 
- Set up 2 brokerage accounts under the trust, (one for fixed income, one for long-term growth) 2 linked checking accounts.
- in the process of finding a financial wealth advisor I can trust within my brokerage for long-term counsel. 

Initial Plan: 
- Plan to invest ~$135,000 in short-term (0–3 month, SGOV) U.S. government bonds for liquidity while we handle some small necessary purchases during this transition.

The Big Question: 
That leaves about $315,000 to invest. 
My preliminary idea:
- 85–90% in short-term bonds for stability and monthly maturity to pay for initial legal costs this year while not touching principle.
- 10–15% initially in either a broad market index fund or the S&P 500 ETF VOO. 
- Dollar-cost-average the equity portion from short term bonds to equities over the next 12 - 18 month until the trust is about 60/40 - 70/30 split between equities/bonds. 

I’m conflicted for these considerations: 
- On one hand, the U.S. stock market seems increasingly disconnected from the reality of the country’s economic and fiscal policies. The S&P 500 appears determined to keep grinding upward, regardless of current events.
- On the other hand, with the S&P 500 at all-time highs again, the market doesn’t seem eager to break far beyond those levels until there’s a clear, sustained direction in international trade or economic policy.

This is all before even considering the somewhat unusual, and sometimes erratic  policy declarations by the executive branch. Not addressing growing tensions between the executive branch and the Federal Reserve, the new appointment of the Chair and how that might influence fiscal policy.

All of that being said, I know that am a layman in all of these matters and don’t pretend to know anything for real. So Any advice on these matters would be great. 

1. Asset allocation for a trust with this specific goal.

2. Is this realistic timeline or a wise goal for the trust? 

 3. Any considerations for general trust management that I might be overlooking.


Thanks for any advice!

Edit: formatting. 
Can I just say well done for being responsible for her care. People don’t realise that we will all need care in the future. The sooner you start planning, the easier it is on your love ones See the links on the sidebar over at r/Bogleheads for the reasons long term investments should be a low-fee index fund that owns the 'whole market'.   That would be VT or a 60/40 mix of VTI (US) and VXUS (international).   Those include 'everything' so other funds would be redundant.

VUSXX would also be a reasonable choice for the short-term liquid side - or if you want to work at it, T-bills of varying durations. These would be state tax exempt if that matters. Your mother is in good health, and has basically no expenses. I say she needs to do her traveling now, not in 10 years. If she is lucky, she may never need long term care. In my family’s case, my husband and I were able to travel by ourselves for 8 weeks in March/April. In July we had to cancel Africa Safari because of change in health status. This would not be a good idea To grow 450K to 1.2M in 13 years would require about an 8% return. Harder then you think, particularly if you have to reduce risk.  7% would be more likely (just short of 1.1M after 13 years at 7%).

Perhaps consider a 2025 target date fund which handles all the allocation: [https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vttvx#performance-fees](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vttvx#performance-fees)

You might look at [https://www.boldin.com/](https://www.boldin.com/) for some planning software. Keep in mind Social Security, medical (medicare is not all free), too (Boldin will walk you through all the things to consider around retirement planning).

I would ignore short-term politics and focus on a long term financial plan and stick with it. Something like the [Golden Ratio Portfolio](https://portfoliocharts.com/portfolios/golden-ratio-portfolio/). Don’t forget that your large bond portion is part of the whole portfolio. Follow-up: 
There is a planned annual distribution to my mother for funds to purchase 1oz of gold and 50oz of silver every year. She likes metals so it seems like a win-win for her happiness and a way to hedge against inflation gradually. I’m doing my best. Things are the best they’ve been in years. This. Travel at 60, not at 70.

We've actually started doing some 'retirement-style' bigger trips in our 50s because we've seen our parents age out of travelling and don't want to miss out. We just did a safari Tanzania in June and it was amazing, even if we had to drag our 12-year old along. (To be honest, it was great to be able to let him experience something like that at that age.)

1mnynih,2025-08-12,"What’s the first stock you ever bought and what did you learn from it?
Was it a well-researched decision or more of an “I like the company” kind of thing? How did it work out in the end?  
  
For me, it was AAPL back when I barely knew what a P/E ratio was. I just liked their products and figured the stock would do well. Luckily it worked out, but looking back, it was pure luck rather than skill. 
first stock: a gold mining penny stock……

what i learned: don’t invest into penny stocks, and do your own research and fully understand what you’re investing into before jumping into something —— it was a recommendation from a friend, luckily it was only $100 but i lost it all and the company went under. It’s forever in my portfolio since it was delisted and I can’t sell it. So I see it every time I log into my account. I bought SPY 30+ years ago… then VOO after it became available… retired at age 49.  Thank you S&P 500! Bought GE when I was in middle school with $1000 given to me by grandparents. 

All I knew was it seemed like a big steady company.

This was like 2006. Then it got hammered. Now it's above where it was then. 

Lesson? 🤷 I don't know enough about any individual company to say anything with confidence. I do, however, feel very confident in the results of shareholder capitalism broadly. Buy everything. PLTR, bought at $14 as I was seeing it on Reddit a lot. This was like 2 years ago. I sold for a small gain when it dipped a bit because Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock. Lesson learned: don’t listen to analysts. My first big buy was Yahoo.  I remember that stock would go from 170 to 340 in a couple of days and it was totally distracting.  At the time, there was no smartphone so you literally watch the ticker on CNBC and every 20 seconds, YHOO rolls around again in the TV screen and it was +87.59, + 91.56...+ 93.05, + 103.56, + 117.19, etc.   There would be a few of these every day when during the dot com boom. 

I literally have to skip class because I can't get off the drug of CNBC when your stock is the hot one for the day.  

Totally busted in the dot com bust but fortunately the lesson was valuable and I learned never to lean on a few stocks and learned the psychology of investing. Microsoft 

That I’m a genius Diversification is the only free lunch. It's the only way to be sure you own the winners, and a huge chunk of stock returns come from a smaller sunset of the overall market. 

In terms of being cautious, my risk tolerance is very high. I know in my bones that this money is not needed for 30+ years. So I do not care if my stock portfolios value goes down. I know American corporate capitalism will pull through. 

But if you're super nervous then maybe talk to a financial planner about having a little more conservative portfolio of stocks and bonds, instead of just stocks. I started investing in HON dividend re-investment program in the mid-1990 as a work colleague talked incessantly about HON over lunch. Not knowing anything about the stock market, I started investing $100/ month and then about 5 years later changed to $500/quarter and occasionally extra money over the years. Today, it is my largest individual holding (nearing 7 figures) having only sold once (100 shares) during Covid to re-model our kitchen. First stock.. bought a cool $1000  shares worth of AAPL in Sep 2010. If I did my math correctly, it’s about $9.50 or so pre-split. My dumbass sold it after it doubled sometime after.

1mntn2c,2025-08-12,"Secured First Real Job, Trying to figure out where I should be putting long term investments
24M, graduated last year and secured a government job with my county 4 months ago. Annual income is ~65k in a tax heavy state (CA), but LOTS of room for vertical growth financially. 4k in student loans but no other debt. 

Im trying to figure out where I should be prioritizing my investments. I have a Roth IRA with fidelity (80% FXIAX, the rest Google, Nvidia, and taiwan semi conductor) and opened a HYSA to hold my emergency fund. 

The county also offers a 457b, and Im trying to figure out if its something I should be investing in? I have the option to go pre tax or post tax dollars, but in general I just dont think I understand what the advantage is. Is it essentially just another investment account but with a higher yearly limit? And if the 457b IS something I should be putting money into, should I prioritize it over the Roth IRA? 
Here is my stab at making this simple.  

Never leave matching funds on the table.  Always invest to get the match.

You want to hit retirement with both Roth and Traditional money.  What ratio depends on things that are unknowable now, so just take a stab at it.

Usually Roth early in your career, then switch to Traditional as your income (and marginal tax rate) increase.

None of us know enough to find the perfect path.  So just do something reasonable and then go out and enjoy life.  Min reasonable, IMO, would be 10% of income into index funds. Yes, invest in your 457b.  Given your current income, I would contribute with post tax dollars (Roth).  Once your income reaches $100k, you might consider doing 50% pre tax and 50% post tax.  The Roth 457b is similar to your Roth IRA, but has a higher contribution limit ($23.5k/year).  You’ll probably have fewer investment choices, but it’s worth contributing to it.  If you plan to retire before age 59.5, you can take distributions from a 457b penalty free.  

Assuming you’ll have a pension and Social Security in retirement, the 457b would give you another lot of money to draw from in retirement. Would prioritize the 401k up to a match, then a Roth IRA, then the 401k to the 23.4k match, and then the 457b.

Invest in broad based equity funds, based on total stock market, or SP 500.

1mnsm15,2025-08-11,"300k cash now? Or wait till weeks over
I’ve got 300k in cash I wanna put into the market long term (10+ yrs). My orignal plan was to just lump sum it into the S&P 500 thru something like VOO or SPY and be done with it. But this week feels like one of those weird ones where a lot is happenning at once. Should I wait till week I over? I know I know…time in market is better than timing. 
Anything you choose to do will have regrets. Wait and the market will go up, buy now and it will dip a bit.  There’s are so many post from people trying to time the market. Sometimes we have to trick our brain into the illusion of control...if it helps, put 50k in per week for the next 6. That way you're not putting pressure on any one moment where you'll have the index price memorized to agonize over Honestly I’d put 200k in a HYSA and invest the rest. Time in the market is fine but in the face of slowing job numbers and inflation growing..wait one or two months won’t make or break you one bit. The answer is always now, you’re not taking this cash out for years and years probably decades. 

If you wait and the opposite of a crash happens you’re just buying into newer highs and you’ll sit on the sidelines forever. A time horizon of 10+ years means anything now is irrelevant. That is 2 presidencies and endless policy changes from now for example. Assuming you go with a simple index fund there is nothing to worry about, you should start getting returns or something will make you freeze up every week forever, which is common in most people who are getting started with investing and even some experienced people who get depressed about the world events.

Despite this I do understand how you feel, but at the same time I felt the same way exiting the housing market crash of 2008. I kept thinking, ""should I wait for a better time?"" and delayed an entire year when I would have had much better returns just starting as soon as possible, and prior to that I could have gone in at market lows but was afraid of how things were.

If it makes you feel better you can do smaller chunks monthly. There is very little chance for the stock market to spike up huge in a 1 year period so you can just do that if you feel better about it. In this way you can capture a small amount of downturn. dollar cost averaging. put in a set amount every month. Just DCA 10k a day I suspect that very few people responding to you know that the Bureau of Labor Statistic's CPI report comes out tomorrow morning (Tue).  Fewer know that today's WSJ reported that Trump's pick to run the Bureau is likely to be the chief economist from the Heritage Foundation.

It is good to look at the Internet for ideas and points to consider.  Don't ask for advice, because most of it will be deeply flawed.  People will tell you what to do in order to validate their own choices. Wait till September and dca into what you choose.

1mmmesw,2025-08-10,"Would you swap NVO with UNH, TTD, FTNT, OSCR, HIMS, SEZL, ABDE, UPS, SNAP?
Bought NVO at 70, at current price, am considering swapping it out with any of these tickers, because I feel the recovery will be slow because of the influence from Trump over the healthcare sector.

* UNH - down 55% this year
* TTD - down 44% this year
* FTNT - up 5% this year, but down 25% from last week
* OSCR - down 14% this year
* HIMS - up 225% this year, but down 18% from last two weeks
* SEZL - up 363% this year, but down 38% from last month
* ABDE - down 35% this year
* UPS - down 30% this year
* SNAP - down 18% this year.

Personally leaning towards FTNT/HIMS/OSCR because they seem to have higher potential.

Appreciate any insights.
Personally I’m holding NVO and adding UNH. Buy high sell low…

If anything, I am accumulating NVO right now. Sell me your shares. “do DD for me” no I wouldn't. Hello no. It looked like LLY was gonna win the PO weight loss battle until their trials had a 25% drop out rate. My money is on NOVO now. I have UNH and NVO. Bigger buy for UNH. Since you have NVO at $70, wait until they release the pill later this year and then sell. I have it at $48 and will be selling once the release come. Don’t plan to sell UNH short term. Is it because of its profitability and market cap that makes it more likely to recover in the next 1 or 2 years? Basically. I like buying cheap and unloved stocks. Healthcare and biotech have, generally speaking, done very poorly in recent years.  Of the 9 names some will over preform and/or underperform NVO.  It looks like bottom fishing.  

I like TTD the best among all the names above but looking for a slightly lower price.  The buyers will support that one again.  ",0,0.33,10,0,SwordfishBrilliant94,investing,['UNH'],would swap nvo unh ttd ftnt oscr hims sezl abde ups snap bought nvo 70 current price considering swapping tickers feel recovery slow influence trump healthcare sector unh 55 year ttd 44 year ftnt 5 year 25 last week oscr 14 year hims 225 year 18 last two weeks sezl 363 year 38 last month abde 35 year ups 30 year snap 18 year personally leaning towards ftnthimsoscr seem higher potential appreciate insights personally im holding nvo adding unh buy high sell low anything accumulating nvo right sell shares dd wouldnt hello looked like lly gonna win po weight loss battle trials 25 drop rate money novo unh nvo bigger buy unh since nvo 70 wait release pill later year sell 48 selling release come dont plan sell unh short term profitability market cap makes likely recover next 1 2 years basically like buying cheap unloved stocks healthcare biotech generally speaking done poorly recent years 9 names preform andor underperform nvo looks like bottom fishing like ttd best among names looking slightly lower price buyers support one
1mmkjzr,2025-08-10,"How do we feel about precious metals?
I am very diversified including assets like gold/silver. Wondering if I should sell into this meteoric rise…gold and silver prices up basically 40% in the past year. market is getting too hot?

At the same time I understand the macro forces behind the move with tariffs and falling confidence in the USD. Do we still think there is room to run or is this going to be a peak like we saw back in 2011?


I love how people here are “buying gold at the top is not smart” but when you point out that stocks are bonkers and a lot of the fundamentals for the AI bubble are eroding, “no there is no top, line only go up”  Precious metals can feel like a rocket ride when they’re ripping 40 %, but they’re still just shiny insurance policies. Gold and silver don’t create earnings; they mostly keep up with inflation over very long stretches and zig when stocks zag.

If you’re heavily overweight on a stock or sector and it’s keeping you up at night, it’s totally reasonable to skim off a little profit and rebalance back to your target allocation. A small slice (5‑10 %) can be a nice hedge against currency/debt worries, but betting the farm on metals is just another form of market timing.

Nobody knows if this run has legs or if it’s 2011 all over again. The macro story changes every week. Stick to a plan that fits your risk tolerance, enjoy the ride, and let the rest of your diversified portfolio do the heavy lifting. If I knew that answer, I’d be much richer than I am.

That said, people are viewing multiple other markets (real estate, equities) the same way. And they’ve been viewing them that way for the past 4 or so years. So are you going to pull out of one (allegedly) overvalued market and into another?

IMO a small amount of metals are useful for diversification. But I don’t speculate on future movements. [Gold to S&P 500TR](https://inflationchart.com/gold-in-spxtr/?logarithmic=1) rating is pretty low now. More than 3 times lower than in 2011. [Silver to S&P 500TR](https://inflationchart.com/silver-in-spxtr/?logarithmic=1) is ridiculously low - close to 1999 all time low now. It is quite possible that we still have a significant room for growth. I've been using the [gold/silver strategy](https://moneymade.io/learn/articles/trading-gold-silver-ratio/) to go in and out of gold and silver over the past couple years and has worked
 
So the rise to the top has worked well >If you're heavily overweight 


Stop body shaming me Gold and Silver are exactly the same as when it was created. The atoms don't change. The politicians and their corporate overlords don't want you to save, they want you to spend and hypothecate more and more debt slaves. The price you see for silver and gold is a paper/digital price, decided in the Fiat derivatives market. I like silver, for me, because it brings discipline to my personal finances. I stack and it's my savings account, liquid enough, so when I have an unexpected expense like a clogged EGR valve, I can sell a little silver to pay for the cost. Shiny enough that I find it satisfying and can resist buying things I don't need. Great in many ways. Ive been hedging with some gold since the US weaponized SWIFT/CHIPS to seize Russia’s foreign reserves. I’ve bought the top in gold numerous times in those years, surprisingly those purchases are no longer remotely close to the top. Strange how things work. 

Most people on Reddit are hyper focused on the daily charts to their detriment, the posts when gold goes down $20 on gold subreddits are hilarious, all the newbs being like ‘oh shit, is it going to 0?!?!?’

The only solid investing advice I’ve learned from Reddit is to not source investing advice from Reddit. Can't speak to how ""we"" feel, but only me.  I'm OK with 5-10% in gold for those trying to minimize overall portfolio volatility, because gold in particular has shown a near zero correlation with stocks and bonds and has passed that test for decades.  But I would do so as a permanent part of an asset allocation strategy, not as a market timing move chasing hot money, especially since PMs have already had a sharp run-up.

For those who don't mind more volatility, in the long run, equities still win historically. I also used GLDM and it is a hold for next few years.",9,0.6,56,0,corn_dick,investing,['META'],feel precious metals diversified including assets like goldsilver wondering sell meteoric risegold silver prices basically 40 past year market getting hot time understand macro forces behind move tariffs falling confidence usd still think room run going peak like saw back 2011 love people buying gold top smart point stocks bonkers lot fundamentals ai bubble eroding top line go precious metals feel like rocket ride theyre ripping 40 theyre still shiny insurance policies gold silver dont create earnings mostly keep inflation long stretches zig stocks zag youre heavily overweight stock sector keeping night totally reasonable skim little profit rebalance back target allocation small slice 510 nice hedge currencydebt worries betting farm metals another form market timing nobody knows run legs 2011 macro story changes every week stick plan fits risk tolerance enjoy ride let rest diversified portfolio heavy lifting knew answer id much richer said people viewing multiple markets real estate equities way theyve viewing way past 4 years going pull one allegedly overvalued market another imo small amount metals useful diversification dont speculate future movements gold sp 500tr rating pretty low 3 times lower 2011 silver sp 500tr ridiculously low close 1999 time low quite possible still significant room growth ive using goldsilver strategy go gold silver past couple years worked rise top worked well youre heavily overweight stop body shaming gold silver exactly created atoms dont change politicians corporate overlords dont want save want spend hypothecate debt slaves price see silver gold paperdigital price decided fiat derivatives market like silver brings discipline personal finances stack savings account liquid enough unexpected expense like clogged egr valve sell little silver pay cost shiny enough find satisfying resist buying things dont need great many ways ive hedging gold since us weaponized swiftchips seize russias foreign reserves ive bought top gold numerous times years surprisingly purchases longer remotely close top strange things work people reddit hyper focused daily charts detriment posts gold goes 20 gold subreddits hilarious newbs like oh shit going 0 solid investing advice ive learned reddit source investing advice reddit cant speak feel im ok 510 gold trying minimize overall portfolio volatility gold particular shown near zero correlation stocks bonds passed test decades would permanent part asset allocation strategy market timing move chasing hot money especially since pms already sharp runup dont mind volatility long run equities still win historically also used gldm hold next years
1mm185w,2025-08-09,"Investing as a 21 college student
Hey yall 

I wanted to ask if these stocks are good to invest in for my taxable brokerage account and my Roth IRA. I am a 21 year old college student investing around $120/month in my taxable brokerage account with fidelity and $237/month for my Roth IRA. If anyone has any advice let me know please and thank you 

Roth IRA 
QQQM 50% 
VTI 30%
VXUS 10% 
GOOGL 10%

Taxable Brokerage 
VTI 25% 
QQQM 25% 
NVDA 25% 
Visa 15% 
APPLE 5% 
MSFT 5% 

Love that you're diving in at 21 – your biggest asset right now is time, not fancy stock picks. VTI and VXUS give you a piece of thousands of companies across the U.S. and the rest of the world, so you're already well diversified. QQQM and the single stocks (NVDA, GOOG, etc.) lean heavily into tech and will swing around a lot; that's fine as a small 'fun' sleeve, but don't expect them to magically beat a plain index without more risk. Most people keep 80–90% in a broad market fund or two, then use the remainder for companies they follow for fun. The exact percentages matter way less than consistently adding to your accounts and having a cushion so you don't have to sell during a downturn. Keep it simple and let compounding do the hard work. Since u have time at your advantage try to do it 80-20 ratio. it totally depends upon ones risk profile. I am at 60-40 yes Yea if you’re nervous qqqm def better than qqq as the former is geared towards longer term investors and has lower expense ratios. If you do feel uncomfortable there’s no need to lose sleep over it while we’re still young, just put it into a more stable etf. At the end of the day time in the market matters the most so we have the biggest advantage starting young Currently I’m working 8 hour shifts at my college part time job and it’s super chill and I barely do any work which gives me time to stare at stocks all day. QQQ is more volatile so I can make more profitable transactions in the shorter term. Not exactly day trading though I will admit that doing this is kinda immature. Time in the market > timing the market at the end of the day but I’m just really bored at work so I need something to do Dump it all into nvda before their earnings report (jk don’t do that probably not a good idea).

I’m in a similar boat to you, generally the consensus seems to be to put it into reliable ETFs.

1mlui74,2025-08-09,"Google’s Decade Long Bet on Custom Chips Is the AI Wild Card Wall Street Hasn’t Priced In, Profitable Businesses Will Run on ASICs, Not GPUs, GPT-5 making it move?
The rollout of ChatGPT-5 could be less about a leap in model capability and more about a strategic infrastructure shift from NVIDIA GPU-based inference (Azure) to Google TPU-based inference. If correct, this represents a major cost structure disruption in AI serving, one that the market has not yet priced in, with direct implications for NVIDIA’s data center margins and Microsoft’s AI economics.

Google has too much risk right now with the Department of justice. Else I would say it’s an opportunity. Watch out when the market realises when ChatGPT is not running on Nvidia.

Could it just be:
GPT-5: New brain?
Nah.
Same brain, new landlord.
Bye-bye NVIDIA GPUs on Azure, hello Google TPUs.
Bye, Felicia. 👋
google doesn't sell those TPUs and are still constrained by producing them at TSMC. it probably wouldn't be a lot better if they did it at samsung. What does it matter they don’t sell the chips if they rent them? If anything that seems more bullish for GCP Anthropic’s Claude runs on TPUs inside Google’s data centers. I don’t see Google ever selling them market. When they can bring more workload to their own data Centre. Nvidia just open sourced Blackwell with FP4 production capabilities.  tl:dr  unless TPU has this capability today, it's not competitive with Nvidia's Blackwell architecture which RAISES PERFORMANCE 30X over Hopper.

[https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/delivering-1-5-m-tps-inference-on-nvidia-gb200-nvl72-nvidia-accelerates-openai-gpt-oss-models-from-cloud-to-edge](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/delivering-1-5-m-tps-inference-on-nvidia-gb200-nvl72-nvidia-accelerates-openai-gpt-oss-models-from-cloud-to-edge)

How does GPT5 change any of that?

Here is the [Nvidia slide showing the perf gain](https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1bi1rok/blackwell_inf_compared_to_hopper/#lightbox) from a year ago. And yet the entirety of Google's workloads runs on TPUs. Clearly, they are flexible enough. Everything looks like a transformer these days, anyways, and every workload is based on matrix multiplications. Which is what TPUs are designed for.
They are more scalable as well: thousands of chips in a TPU superpod, but only 72 Blackwell GPUs connected by NV link. Unfortunately you are sighting false marketing claims that have been circulating for years and for which there is no justification. Zero basis in reality. Perform the expensive training once on a GPU, then handle each prompt with a TPU. There’s much more inference & prompting, then is the need for training. state-of-the-art inference optimizations (FlashAttention, quantization kernels, tensor parallelism frameworks) are developed for CUDA (Nvidia) first, so TPU adoption can lag, but JAX and PyTorch/XLA support has improved, the GPU ecosystem is still far more mature for inference.

There’s no need to throw the TPU away, you don’t need to get rid of them. The mathematics matrices and tensors make up a lot of what’s going on in TPU. There’s many companies that want to cost-effective way to run their models. No, what I'm saying is the right tool for the right job.

You seem to be under some notion that GPUs are ""less than"" or inferior in some way to a purpose built part like an asic.  Bitcoin mining is simple, there is one algorithm, it just get harder and harder to unlock more value as time goes on.  It was a perfect case for an ASIC and an obvious and economic reason why ASICs replaced GPUs for BTC mining in 2012 or whenever.   However you will notice in ETH mining there was never an ASIC developed, that algorithm was suited to GPUs which were widely spread before they went to a proof of stake model.

AI models are nothing like BTC.

Why GPUs are the processor of choice for AI is because they are programmable or flexible.  AI models get tweeked and new attempts at problem solving are commonplace.   ASICs by their nature are necessarily limited in what they can do, and this is why they've had a hard time gaining traction.  An asic might take two years to develop and come to market, but the industry is too dynamic.  By the time that product is ready to deploy, it's obsolete.  (The notable exception is Google who can continue to throw internally developed workloads at it.)

Maybe ASICs have a place in the future, but if you look at TPUs to GPUs at any given point in time (and it's VERY difficult to do because of the closed environment around TPUs) TPUs are less capable (run fewer models) and generally less performant than the GPU of the same process architecture by the time they're displaced by their next gen brethren.  Google even quit (or has severely pulled back) submitting TPU to the MLPerf benchmark organization.

ASICs have been promised as the GPU killer from the beginning times of AI computation (which I've been following since 2015).   But the semi industry have never really landed a successful merchant ASIC part for the space.  Today advancements are happening too quickly for them to keep up with a) the flexibility of a programmable GPU, b) Nvidia's relentless pace of hardware and software innovation and c) the CUDA software ecosystem.

I realize it may not and you can't ""time the market"", but surely VTI or whatever will fall well below 300 again in the not too distant future.... Makes me sick missing out on six figures for no reason! And I don't know what percentage to put in which. All in VTI/ Some SPY? Some VOO? Idk.
Then wait till it gets even higher > understands you can't time the market

tale as old as time Google the S&P 500 and zoom out to 2007. We've been at all time highs for about 15 years now. The stock market reaches all-time highs fairly often, occurring on roughly 31% of months since 1926 or about a quarter of the time since 1950, with the S&P 500 hitting new records on about 7% of trading days.

Ai slop answer.  Don’t try to outsmart yourself here.  Yes it could go down.  But it could also go on a 20% tear and then even a correction will be above the previous ATH. The stock market is within 5% of ATHs 40%> of the time. Act accordingly. Exactly. Its more likely that it'll go up. SPY @ 630: Why didn't I buy at 530?

1ml5ycm,2025-08-08,"A response to ""lower interest rates, why?""
Another redditor posted [this question](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ml11ly/lower_interest_rates_why/) and I got carried away with my answer.  
It does not fit the comment space, and I thought it may be interesting for a larger audience than the comments from the post. Please note that I do not have any political affiliation, I am not even american, and I am only providing a semi-educated commentary about the FED's job.  
\------------------------------------------------------------------  
The FED has two mandates: maximum employment and low inflation (nowadays officially 2% [FED dual mandate](https://www.chicagofed.org/research/dual-mandate/dual-mandate)).

One very simplistic way of thinking about the FED is the Taylor rule ([Taylor Rule wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_rule)): essentially, if the FED sees employment and inflation raising, it should raise rates in order to *cool* the economy. Vice versa, if employment and inflation are going down, it should lower rates in order to *heat* the economy.

This is econ 101. 

What is interesting is that, normally, the economy is mostly hit by demand shocks. We think about demand shocks as changes in the demand for goods, which, for a constant supply, increases inflation (prices are a point where demand and supply meet) and increases employment/lowers unemployment (to make more goods firms hire more labour).

Keeping rates systematically below a given point (what we call r\*), makes it so that when a demand shock hits: prices go up, unemployment goes down, labour is squeezed, so wages need to increase, which means prices go up and on and on. Effectively, this is what happened in the US - and globally - in the 70s ([the anatomy of double digit inflation](https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c11462/c11462.pdf)).

Therefore, economists tend to think about the economy as a series of equilibrium: there is an equilibrium interest rate (r\*), an equilibrium unemployment rate (NAIRU or u\*), and many other fundamentals, which we call **stars**. There **stars** tend to move for several reasons. For example, an economy in which people have high rate of unionization may have a higher NAIRU than an economy with low unionization rates. Therefore, not all economies are the same, and not all stars are the same. Here is an example from a paper I like a lot, which tracks r\* in all major economies: [global trends in interest rates](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25039).

This is also econ 101.

There are (in my opinion) three sides of what has been going on in the US in the last 8 months.  
  
First, inflation is on an overall downward trend, but still far from the rate of 2% ([FED inflation](https://www.federalreserve.gov/economy-at-a-glance-inflation-pce.htm)). Normally, we would look at this as a trivia problem: inflation is higher than target, let's keep rates high. However, because the data we get tends to be late, we may also try to extrapolate its trend.

For example, the European Central Bank, which is basically the FED but for the majority of countries from the EU, lowered rates even when inflation was above 2%, and still managed to get it to target. You can see EA inflation [here](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/macroeconomic_and_sectoral/hicp/html/index.en.html) and rates [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ECBDFR). This is because they saw it was on an overall downard trend, assumed that real inflation was going to go down anyway, and took a more aggressive stance. 

In October, t[he FED did the same](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFF). The rates were higher than now, and had been lowered as the FED was afraid that inflation would have othewise quickly gone below 2%.

Second, his is where tariffs come into play. The Fed tracks inflation expectations from the SPF ([survey of professional forecasters](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/real-time-data-research/inflation-forecasts)). The professional forecasters are not extremely good at predicting what is going to happen, but they do capture the business sentiment fairly well. Looking at the median of the surveys, you may see that after Trump's election, inflation expectations start to rise again because of tariffs.

That is because tariffs are really tricky. They are not a *demand* shock like the one we talked about before. They are a *supply* (specifically *technology/productivity)* shock. Technology shocks are a type of shock that depresses the labour market while being inflationary. For example, a new cost saving tech is introduced to the market: this makes it so that products are cheaper, so people can buy more of them, and the labour market is doing good, but inflation is below its optimal value. Dealing with supply shocks is a nightmare for economists at the FED.

The problem with technology shocks is that the two sides of the Taylor rule - inflation and employment - are not going to the same direction. Currently, if you look at inflation (or in this case inflation expectations), by all means you are supposed to *increase* rates. Inflation is raising (2.2 in April vs 2.6 in June). Inflation expectations are also rising.

Third, employment. Until recently, our impression was that the labour market was doing good. If you look at the FED announcement, they cited lower demand for labour (which we track from [vacancies](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LMJVTTUVUSM647S)) and a lower labour supply (because of the new immigration policies), but overall growing [employment](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS) and a very low unemployment rate (you can put [unemployment](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE) and [NAIRU](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NROU) in a single chart and see that unemployment is below the NAIRU).

However, **the job revisions are signalling a recession incoming**.

\-----------------------            --------------  
Effectively, the FED has been served a hot potato.  On one side, you have a labour market which is ***not strong*** by any metric, which means you are supposed to **lower** the rates to support the economy.

On the other side, inflation will probably raise even more now that the tariffs are starting to effectively come in. Imagine a paradox in which all you buy is 100% imported. On average, inflation would be 15% compared to the previous month, and more compared to the previous year. While this is not the case, in a scenario in which inflation is already rising, adding tariffs on top is not a good idea.

So why do [analysts think the FED is going to cut rates in September ](https://www.reuters.com/business/jpmorgan-brings-forward-fed-rate-cut-forecast-september-2025-08-08/)?

It is because a recession is probably undergoing, and it is getting worse and worse by the day. On one side, this means that the little element that gets multiplied in the Taylor rule coefficient for the labour market gets higher. On the other side, randomly raising prices means overall lower economic activity. Basically, because during a recession people are buying less goods, the prices go down because there is a declining demand.

Remember the demand shock from before? Right now, the US economy is undergoing a large negative supply shock, and a semi-large negative demand shock. Both of them have negative effects on the labour market and overall economic activity. But they have contrasting effects on inflation. Realistically, the technology - tariff - shock will prevail on the demand - lower econ activity - in increasing inflation.

So, let's answer the question. Should the FED cut rates? I do not know. **But I know they will**. However, inflation will probably go back to the large levels we have seen during the pandemic.

\----------------------------------  
Finally, one bonus question:

Is Trump right when he says JPOW should have cut rates before? Basically, **no**.

The reason is very simple. Had JPOW cut rates before, inflation would have raised to over the current 2.6%, and the labour market would have been in slightly a better shape. However, the likelihood of managing inflation would have gone virtually to zero. 

EDIT: Fixed typos and formatting.
Stagflation is a dangerous game. You're on point here and I can't help but wonder what you think about the treasury bond market in relation to all this.

We know that according to Trump the bond markets got ""yippy"" when his first tariff chart started to crash the stock market. This surely forced him to delay them. We're allegedly ""back"" to there with tariffs, yet we're near all-time highs in the market. What will he do when the yield gets too high again? Yeah, I am also fairly surprised by what is going on with the market and tariffs, simply because the reaction to the first tariff announcement implied something like a -10% on the market if I remember correctly.

Today, we should be at about 9% from January. A lot of that gain happened after the EU trade announcement.  
  
One explaination I can come up with is that there was a reduction in uncertainty. The biggest non-american trading partners (EU, JPN, SK,UK) had a set tariff of about 15% and Canada and Mexico are apparently managing to trade easily thanks to NAFTA (although I haven't looked that much into it). I think it may have been a sign that that was the moment the market thought there were finally sufficiently good business conditions to start investing again. 

Another thing to keep in mind is that the 9% gain goes basically out the window if you consider exchange rates.   
100 USD in the SP500 in January meant 97 EUR.   
109 USD in the SP500 today mean 93 EUR. 

This may still be too large an evaluation for the current situation.

Trump basically said he likes having a weak dollar (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veo6ksI5H8c) arguing it improves exports. Apparently, Trump's new appointee to the FED is the architect around dollar's devaluation (https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-administration-mar-a-lago-plan-to-weaken-dollar-is-deeply-flawed-by-kenneth-rogoff-2025-05).

This takes effectively an anti-consumer position, because it lowers internal competition; and a pro-manufacturer position, because it lowers competition. But manufacturing in the US is deeply integrated with global supply chains, so the short term effect on manufacturing in the US is also negative (one proxy would be employment in manufacturing https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MANEMP)  
  
I kinda think he got the idea of the US being a manufacturing superpower from seeing China and how his advisors were scared of the power Chinese manufacturing had on US supply chains (from chips and such). That, combined with his 70s view of the economy as ""making things"", is fundamentally incompatible with the current economy. Let me ask a question I've been thinking about since we got the bad jobs data. If the Fed lowers the rate, would it actually increase jobs? We have been seeing an outsized portion of Capex spending by tech companies in AI with the explicit purpose of reducing the number of jobs they require. If granted access to cheaper borrowing rates, it wouldn't be crazy to imagine that it is mostly spent on efforts to reduce jobs instead of growing them.

That's just one sector, but every sector is at least actively considering replacing jobs with AI anywhere they can and at the earliest opportunity to do so. The dollar is either the world currency or is progressively devalued, but it cannot be both. Floating exchange rates to not foster investment. An international investor that wants to invest on NVIDIA has no way of protecting itself from randomly set exchange rates. That is part of the reason why, even though growth prospect for the EU are not great, investment has started flowing there. It is a large open market, which is the closest thing to the US. 

That is just a bad capital allocation for the global economy. Investors would like to invest on the US service sector, but they are facing additional risks. Moreover, they may get randomly taxed for some reason [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/16/donald-trump-revenge-tax-could-threaten-foreign-investment-into-us-analysts-say](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/16/donald-trump-revenge-tax-could-threaten-foreign-investment-into-us-analysts-say) 

""What will he do when the yield gets too high again?"" I think we need to wait and see. For now (september to next year), there is a world in which the FED lowers rates, the market does not buy enough treasury to keep the yields low, and the FED does lots of OMO. 

In a very distant future in which inflation gallops, and economic activity is not too bad, and interest rates need to be raised, we will see how truly independent the FED may be. But by then who knows how many, even within the FED, will want it to still be independent. After all, the new Trump appointee says "" pure independence is incompatible with a democratic system."" [https://media4.manhattan-institute.org/wp-content/uploads/reform-the-federal-reserves-governance-to-deliver-better-monetary-outcomes.pdf](https://media4.manhattan-institute.org/wp-content/uploads/reform-the-federal-reserves-governance-to-deliver-better-monetary-outcomes.pdf) Shhhh, OP is vry smrt > it's a matter of upgrading your iPhone every 4 years instead of 2 and your typical person owns 27 pairs of sneakers and don't need 28-35.

So we're just making up imaginary people now and claiming they're representative of the average american? I had a feeling you'd have something to say, and I appreciate your answers. 

I hadn't really thought about the government weakening the dollar on purpose. It is sort of a cheat code to make things look good on paper aside from the stated intent.

I've heard a bit of noise about efforts by the E.U. and U.K. to incentivize more investment into their own markets. With your Nvidia example I wonder if we're doing that for them. The Fed is short for ""Federal Reserve"", not an acronym, and doesn't need to be set in all-caps. Initialisms which may be appropriate depending on the context include ""FRS"" for ""Federal Reserve System"" or ""FOMC"" for ""Federal Open Market Committee"".

1ml1elh,2025-08-08,"Fortinet Stock Analysis (-25% Price Drop)

I recently did a deep dive on Fortinet, and here are my takeaways.

The stock recently got leveled after their revenue growth from a hardware refresh cycle underwhelmed wall street. The team gives very modest and reslistic guidance and doesn't celebrate their performance and instead gives a formulaic roadmap of their trajectory, product/service rollouts and mid term goals. 

Fortinet competes most directly with Palo Alto Networks but positions itself as a more budget-friendly option. For small and mid-sized businesses, Fortinet is often a primary cybersecurity solution (even though the market is fragmented and most companies have to use more than one cyber security companies services). In larger enterprises, it is more commonly used as a cost-effective firewall or SASE option for regional or secondary facilities, while the core network and main data centers are usually protected by Palo Alto Networks, Zscaler or Netskope. 

Fortinet is well-regarded for delivering high-quality firewalls that are both energy and cost efficient compared to competitors. This focus on performance per dollar has helped them build a massive customer base of around 700,000+, far ahead of Palo Alto’s roughly 90,000 customers. The trade-off is a much lower average revenue per customer. That large installed base is where their moat really sits today.

The growth opportunity for Fortinet is in upselling its existing SMB-heavy base into cloud-native SASE services and gradually shifting the business model toward higher-margin subscription revenue. Right now, the company still makes most of its money from hardware sales with cross-selling and upgrade cycles layered in. They most recently announced their upcoming move to SASE and view them self as a contender for the #1 position when it comes to SASE market share. 

In hardware firewalls, Fortinet holds about 50 percent of the global market by unit volume, making it the clear leader. By revenue share, Palo Alto leads, reflecting its higher prices and focus on large enterprises. Fortinet’s lower-cost positioning also gives them room to raise prices over time if they choose. Management has a track record of prioritizing customer satisfaction, often focusing on designing more energy and cost-efficient products to meet the needs of their customer base

It’s true that Fortinet was slower than peers to embrace cloud-native security, but it may not be too late. Many of their SMB customers have not fully moved to the cloud, and for a lot of them, switching to a different security ecosystem would be costly and disruptive. That inertia gives Fortinet some breathing room to catch up. They will probably not be able to convert enterprise companies to use FTNT in their core data centers. But once again, they work great as a secondary solution.

What do you all think? Am I missing anything here? 
My company uses them and their ""Don't ask me again on this device"" button has never worked once, making me hate thinking about them. I'm in. Fortinet has no SMB program, they lost in a super cycle for HW Refresh, as we are in 4 years after covid.

Fortinet is top level in CVE vulnerabilities, the last 18 months, that’s an absolute no go and shows some deep product issues and will decrease margins.

Fortinet has no 50% of the market it’s some 10% 3-4 place.

Moving to the Cloud isn’t for Fortinet, they are a Data Center FW company.

You don’t seem to understand the sector. I think companies periodically over time have collectively made that button useless. My remember this account, don't ask me again buttons just do nothing nowadays. Good call here. I hold a small position in Fortinet for now but the other players reporting will certainly add some more clarity to the matter. SMB stands for Small to Medium sized Business which is what makes up most of Fortinets customer base. 

Quick google search shows Fortinet is not even in the top 5 of cyber security companies with the most CVE vulnerabilities. 

They have a 50% market share of existing firewalls by product sales volume . Not by revenue. They have high sales volume, but at a cheaper price than their competitors. 

Fortinet is expanding its SASE (secure access service edge) offering by integrating its security and networking capabilities into a unified cloud-delivered platform. Their biggest growth driver going forward.   

A simple google search would have saved you time typing this up. But I'm happy to help clear up your confusion. I think you wait until after Palo Alto reports on 8/18. If they hit and guide up it’s a specific Fortinet issue. If not it’s an industry issue and might not be a bad play. But my money is on PANW hitting. As a former Palo Alto employee, I really hope you buy more Fortinet. hmm.. are you saying that fortinet revenue is also dependent on how well its products integrate with apps from its bigger peers? hmm.. are you saying that fortinet revenue is also dependent on how well its products integrate with apps from its bigger peers?

1mkuq5z,2025-08-08,"Move a large amount of money into the stock market now, or wait until fall in case of a market correction?
In my rollover IRA, I have about 50k in a Schwab Prime Advantage Money Fund (SWVXX). (I put the money in there last month after transferring it from a previous 403b.) I wonder if I should start putting that money into ETFs (VOO, VTI) or individual stocks (BRK/B, MSFT, AAPL) to get more growth, but I also wonder whether I should wait for fall to do so, as many are anticipating a market correction due to the lack of job growth, interest rates being cut, etc. 

Another wrinkle is that I **may** move to Europe within the next year (though it's still quite unclear), and if I do so I will have to switch from ETFs to individual stocks due to taxes in my target country (essentially, they'll tax the shit out of foreign ETF gains whereas the taxes on foreign-held individual stocks are at the normal rate). 

Any advice, input, thoughts would be welcome! 
most people fail trying to time the market like this No one knows what the market will do. Anyone who tells you what it will do with any confidence is full of shit. 

You have three options:
* Invest it all now (this is historically optimal)
* Invest a bit at a time over the next N months or years (called dollar cost averaging). This is not optimal but protects your downside. 
* Wait until a market crash. You might get lucky but usually you end up watching the market go up. 

On average the market goes up (otherwise why would you invest in it.) 

(Not financial advice and I don't know shit.) Market will go up +20% from here and then “crash” -5% and OP will feel like a genius when he buys. WHEN - not IF - there is a correction, it may be so much farther up from here that it never gets this cheap again. You may be waiting forever. Time in the market is almost always better/easier than timing the market That money was already invested ?

I am not sure why if you have a 401k that is fully invested in the market and then do a roll over , why do you think it should be DCA back in ? It was already invested into the market right?

The roll over shouldn't affect anything? If you did not do the roll over you wouldn't randomly go 100% cash just to DCA would you?

A roll over changes nothing . what if the drop takes 10years and doesnt even come back to the levels where we are rn?  
then what? You have a possibility of a near term expense with your move & you are getting a 4% yield in your current investment. I would at minimum wait until after you decide if you are moving to Europe and/or complete the move. This really depends on how active you are and your risk tolerance.   If both are low, ETF/Mutual Fund S&P500 and forget about it.  Individual stocks will require a little more research and can be way more volatile than most would like it.   It just really depends like I said. Honestly, timing the market is a gamble — even the pros mess it up. If you’re nervous about dumping the whole $50k in now, DCA it over a few months so you catch dips if they happen.

Your possible Europe move is huge here — if ETFs get taxed hard there, you might just start building positions in the individual stocks you’d hold long-term (BRK/B, MSFT, AAPL) so you don’t have to sell later.

SWVXX is at least giving you some yield while you decide, so no rush-panic needed 👍.

1mkteh6,2025-08-08,"Long Term Capital Gains Tax Minimization Strategy
Wanted to get your feedback on a tax strategy based on this hypothetical situation to minimize my taxes and avoid wash sale rules (other rule I'm not considering?), while also getting similar market exposure:

Sell Lot 1: $SPY +$100,000 gain (holding for 1+ year)  
Sell Lot 2: $SPY -$51,650 loss (holding for 1+ year)

Net Long Term Gain: $48,350

Buy: $48,350 $VOO, a similar position but buying a different ETF would not trigger wash sale rules

This would save me about $7,252.50 in federal taxes for the year. Is doing the above every year an effective way to reduce my taxes over the long term? Is there an ordinary income (assume I make $200,000 from my normal job) or other piece I'm missing?

Based on the long term capital gains tax (federal) IRS rules below (let's ignore state tax details for now)

|**Tax rate**|Single|
|:-|:-|
|0%|$0 to $48,350|
|15%|$48,351 to $533,400|

Source: [https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/capital-gains-tax-rates](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/capital-gains-tax-rates)

  

Capital gains rates are based on your total income, not just your cap gains sales. 

Your $200k salary will have you in the 15% bracket. Short-term gains are taxed *as* ordinary income, i.e. the additional $$ is taxed at that marginal rate.

Long-term gains are taxed at 0, 15, or 20% based on your total income. You would be in the 15% bracket. there is no statute of limitations on tax fraud. The IRS could be refunded in 8 years and with AI these things will become much easier to spot. 

Also, while it's unlikely this in itself will trigger something, there are always random audits and if OP is audited for something else, it would be easy for an agent to spot this violation. >Buy: $48,350 $VOO, a similar position but buying a different ETF would not trigger wash sale rules

If the IRS challenged this, they could easily argue SPY and VOO are substantially identical and disallow the loss. 

Ordinary income does factor in, so you wouldn't be in the 0% bracket. Tax advisor here, you’ll be taxed at 15% of the net gain, so $7200 is your consequence of the $48k net.  Purchasing a new but similar ETF will not trigger wash loss sales because it’s not the same identifier. 

On your 1099-B, they’ll actually consolidate those LT gains/losses onto one line at the end and you can use that single line entry in lieu of listing out each individual sale. You’d have to make literally $0 in wages for you to see a lower LT capital gains rate.  

You plan for 15%, hope that deductions and credits whittle that down at filing. Wash sale is only applicable for claiming losses. You're selling for a net gain. Your losses from selling lot 2 just offset some of the gains from selling lot 1.

You can only get into the wash sale scenario if you only sell the specific shares from lot 2 for the loss. But keep in mind you can only offset $3k of ordinary income per year with capital losses but you can carry over losses in excess of $3K to subsequent years (up to $3K per year) indefinitely I believe. Technically yes, you could save money putting 48 k of LCTG per year, but I think it’s on the first 48000 so you’d need no other income ( I hope I’m wrong !) Several problems here any money you make from the sale of stock is added to any other inomce you have and your tax bill will be determined by that total ammount.  You cannot calculate your tax until you add in your other inocme.  Which would push you into the next higher tax bracket. 

A wash sale occurs when you sell stock at a loss.   Meaning no captial gains.  So the capital gains you show would not occur instead you have zero or negative income from the sale. I would probably just use VTI instead of VOO. Could swap back to VOO after the wash period expires if desired.

1mkk31x,2025-08-08,"50k savings, unsure how much to risk and need help understanding
I have 50k saved into a HYSA and I thought that was the smart thing to do with no risk involved but I've recently got curious about stocks and have been looking at things like VOO, SPY, RSP. I'm wondering what the right plan is for me and how much I should be investing and how do I know the right time to withdrawal.

I'm currently making 4K a month after taxes and my rent is 1.2k with utilities included. I dont want to put all my savings into stocks especially early on when I'm unsure of how it works and the risks involved. I was thinking of putting part of my future paychecks into my fidelity account I just want to know which stocks to pick and how much I should be dedicating to stocks.
QQQM is more risk, but not is not compensated risk, and there is literally no reason for a risk adverse person like OP to consider it. How old are you? Put together a total for all your monthly expenses and give yourself a 6-8 month emergency fund to sit in a HYSA. 

Start with 10-20k to invest in since you're new to investing and put most of it in VOO or any SP500 index fund. You should consider this specific investment as a long term investment. Look into ETFs or mutual funds like SWPPX if you don't want to touch individual stocks.

You should consider opening a Roth IRA as well for tax free investing towards your retirement. How about a nice 3-fund portfolio?  US stocks, international stocks, and bonds?  If you are risk adverse, and want less volatility from stocks, use a higher bond position.

Something like 40% VTI, 30% VXUS, and 30% BND.

>I just want to know which stocks to pick

Don't pick stocks.  Most stock pickers underperform the market.  Just buy the entire market with index funds.  Visit r/bogleheads and learn more.  Read a couple books. Personally put every dime in voo/google. I keep like 3k in my checking account. If I ever need more money I usually know it's coming and will either save up or withdraw from brokerage.

In the voo you'll basically double money every 10 years and in the long term I would not worry Chubb insurance - siriusxm - SPY if you don’t want to learn and just want to be consistent and save. Not financial advice. 
But you could move it into SGOV. That’s what I did. 
It earns like 4.25% APY and it pays monthly and you just reinvest it. Or you could just put like 20k in SGOV and 30k into VOO. 
If you want a lil more risk you can do QQQM and VOO. QQQ is just 50% more tech exposure. 
Make sure you have an emergency fund first. How long does it take to get any significant growth from these, is it something like 5 years or 10+ years and when would it be a good time to withdrawal What about VOO?

1mkeiwp,2025-08-07,"""Down 42% in Four Months - Tech Heavy Portfolio Getting Crushed""
I'm posting this partly for accountability and partly hoping someone can relate. My portfolio has gone from $85k to $49k over the past four months, with the worst damage happening in the last two weeks where I lost $18k.

My strategy seemed solid on paper: heavy allocation to established tech giants that I thought were ""too big to fail."" Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon, companies with massive cash flows and dominant market positions. I figured even if growth slowed, these would be relatively stable compared to speculative plays.

Boy, was I wrong.

The combination of rising interest rates, AI bubble concerns, and regulatory pressure has absolutely hammered my holdings. What I thought was a conservative approach to growth investing turned into a masterclass in concentration risk.

Here's what's eating at me: roughly $6k of this loss is my actual contributions, while $30k represents gains from earlier this year that have completely evaporated. I went from feeling like a genius in Q1 to questioning everything I thought I knew about investing.

My current dilemma: Do I start rotating into value stocks or defensive sectors? Do I double down on my thesis that these companies will recover? Or do I take the L and move to index funds like I probably should have done from the start?

The hardest part is watching my timeline for financial goals get pushed back by years. I had plans that depended on this portfolio growth, and now I'm basically back to square one.

Anyone else getting demolished by their ""safe"" large cap positions? How are you adjusting your strategy, or are you just riding it out?
How is that even possible? Were you jumping from one to the other and caught each drop? I’m also very tech heavy and wildly up this quarter Bud, all of those stocks are wildly in the green over the past 3 months. What in the world are you talking about. Op must have full ported into Intel as their ""tech"" allocation How have you managed this? They’re all up big time over the time frame you’re talking about. Stop fucking with your portfolio How have you achieved a 42% drop on those stocks? You're purposefully leaving out information here. Hast to be a completely fake post.  This level of failure is almost impossible in this market. Then you know the reason, had you kept your money in you would be up. The mistake wasn’t the allocation at all as your post suggests, it was the fact you didn’t stick with it. That kind of emotional response is a clear sign that you have too much risk in your portfolio for your risk tolerance.

The increased volatility is causing you to make bad decisions. Either get your emotions in check or lower your risk and volatility. No, we can’t relate. You had to be fucking with options or timing the exact bottom to sell and top to buy to be down this much. You sound dumb….

1mk5l2q,2025-08-07,"I don’t Understand How to get Dividends
(26F) I opened a traditional IRA on the App Public. I only got dividends once. I’ve never invested before but I thought I’d start. 

I’ve contributed $314 and my portfolio value is at $404

Here’s what I’ve invested in (in no particular order) : 
	1.Apple (AAPL) 2.Palantir Technologies (PLTR) 3.NVIDIA (NVDA) 4.Amazon (AMZN) 5.Alphabet (GOOGL) 6.Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) 7.Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF (SCHG) 8.Tesla (TSLA) 9.Microsoft (MSFT) 10.Meta (META) 11.JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM) 12.Rigetti Computing (RGTI) 13.Chime Financial Inc (CHYM)

Some pay dividends monthly, others quarterly.  Look up the stocks you own to find out how or if they pay.  Not all stocks pay dividends. Wrong. At least Alphabet and Meta both do dividends. We're cooked with people citing AI as factual :( 1. Like the other poster mentioned, some stocks don’t pay dividends (typically growth stocks). Some do (typically value stocks).

2. Stocks pay dividends on a regular schedule, usually either monthly or quarterly or yearly. There are also special one-off dividends sometimes, although these have fallen out of favor in favor of stock buybacks (since investors don’t get taxed by that).

3. Companies will announce a dividend as well as a date you must be invested in by in order to receive the dividend.  It looks like those pay quarterly dividends. I dont know about CHYM, and rigetti prob doesn't (?) ( im too oazy to look up the ones I don’t know ) but all the others are quarterly. How old us your account? If less than two quarters, that’s probably why. : )  Not sure if anyone mentioned this, but there is such a thing as an ""ex dividend date,"" and you need to purchase the stock the day before that to receive the upcoming dividends. A simple Google search of (stock name) dividend date or something along those lines will pull up all sorts of websites that track dividend amounts and pay dates (I usually use Market Chameleon). Good luck!! Ohhh that’s helpful. I opened it in April, so it’s going on two quarters right? It’s with schwab and s&p 500 right? That’s the only overlap I’m aware of. Then again I know very little about this stuff. And I was concerned with dividends because that’s all investors rave about Barely 2 quarters, so yeah, around the end of each quarter you’ll see them dropping into your account (or reinvested, if you clicked that box). Each company’s pay date is different.

Reinvesting is preferred unless you need to use the income right away

I’m not familiar with that app, hopefully  you can look up each stock profile. It should list the dividend’s ex date and pay date. As long as you own it before the ex date, you will be paid the dividend for that quarter. 

You probably received a bunch of June dividends.  He didn’t say it was a fact- just citing his source! Thank you for commenting tho, this all helps me How? You have to invest in dividend paying stocks. You have to be holding that stock on the record date. Then your brokerage will deposit the money received from the company on the payment date into your account. Typically, you can elect to have those dividends re-invested right back into the same stock that they came from, or you can use those funds for other purposes.

A distribution (rather than dividend) is the word used to describe payments from a fund. The fund received dividends from a company and then the fund pays distributions to the share holders of the fund.

1mjxe6e,2025-08-07,"MSCI world, hedge vs unhedged
I'm a British investor, and I'm growing concerned about the prospect of the dollar weakening, which seems such a big point in Trump's agenda. 

Like many people, I'm putting my money in MSCI World, which is heavy on US companies. And it seems likely that while my investment next year may grow at 8%, this profit would be cancelled if the dollar weakens 8% against the pound.

I've seen that there are hedged funds that cancel out the effect of currency, like ishares Msci world EUR hedged. Is this the safe alternative to go for? 
It is assumed that currency exchange rate effects are zero in the long term, meaning currencies are mean-reverting.


Hedging costs money so the if the above assumption is correct, long term unhedged should outperform long hedged.


Dollar mean reverted after the surge in 2022. If you look in the last 5 years, the dollar is still up a bit meaning a unhedged portfolio outperformed. Personally I’m not but you don’t have to be 100% in, you could do just some funds for a world tracker (hedge your hedge?).  Or you could look for a world fund (Excluding US) for 40% and add a 60% a hedged US only fund?

You wouldn’t be down 8% because a world fund would still only be 60% in $, so it’s about 4.8%.  What about the other 40% of your fund, what will their currency be doing vs the £.

How much are the extra fees?  An extra 0.35% a year?  You are losing that from your growth each year, there is a reason we look for cheaper fees.  

If you are buying small amounts monthly (as most do from salaries), rather than a lump sum you will gradually be buying more American stocks for less if the £ has more buying power.  So the question is do you think over the time you are investing the $ will remain low, go lower or bounce back?

Equities are volatile so the currency fluctuations seem like noise to me.  If you were looking at US bonds with a set rate I’d consider it more, as you are looking for more stability and they are supposed to be a hedge against equity volatility. Currency hedging is pretty cheap at this point. And while unhedged should outperform slightly over the very long term due to the fees, one can outperform the other for very extended periods (as demonstrated by the past 15 years or so). 

I've moved to a 70/30 split unhedged/hedged for my international exposure. This will help smooth the ride and offers diversification benefits. I addition, we spend in our local currency. Not hedging is making an explicit bet that your local currency won't very stronger relative to foreign currencies. I don't think we should take that as a complete given, and at least partial hedging seems like a smart bet. Hedging costs can be thought of as an insurance premium in this case. And again, it's pretty cheap insurance.",1,0.56,3,0,JollyMolly817,investing,['UNH'],msci world hedge vs unhedged im british investor im growing concerned prospect dollar weakening seems big point trumps agenda like many people im putting money msci world heavy us companies seems likely investment next year may grow 8 profit would cancelled dollar weakens 8 pound ive seen hedged funds cancel effect currency like ishares msci world eur hedged safe alternative go assumed currency exchange rate effects zero long term meaning currencies meanreverting hedging costs money assumption correct long term unhedged outperform long hedged dollar mean reverted surge 2022 look last 5 years dollar still bit meaning unhedged portfolio outperformed personally im dont 100 could funds world tracker hedge hedge could look world fund excluding us 40 add 60 hedged us fund wouldnt 8 world fund would still 60 48 40 fund currency vs much extra fees extra 035 year losing growth year reason look cheaper fees buying small amounts monthly salaries rather lump sum gradually buying american stocks less buying power question think time investing remain low go lower bounce back equities volatile currency fluctuations seem like noise looking us bonds set rate id consider looking stability supposed hedge equity volatility currency hedging pretty cheap point unhedged outperform slightly long term due fees one outperform extended periods demonstrated past 15 years ive moved 7030 split unhedgedhedged international exposure help smooth ride offers diversification benefits addition spend local currency hedging making explicit bet local currency wont stronger relative foreign currencies dont think take complete given least partial hedging seems like smart bet hedging costs thought insurance premium case pretty cheap insurance
1mjh9ct,2025-08-06,"Did I pick a good investment?
I have $104,500 in SPY, I can handle 50% drops, and I can wait years. I want a safe investment that can't go bankrupt.

Gold just doesn't have the gains I'm looking for, and it can be just as volatile on the downside as SPY. These are set and forget investments. I do not have time to keep track of what is happening or trade.
VOO would probably be better than SPY, lower fees The numbers don't lie.  [https://i.imgur.com/UXk7pkL.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/UXk7pkL.jpg) 15% bitcoin is … a bold choice.

5% at most - at most. I mean, like \~22.5% into gold is probably not everyone's cup of tea, I don't blame them, I didn't think it was worth it for a long time until I read [The A B C of Money](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/25102198.pdf) by Andrew Carnegie, when I then decided to get my allocation closer to that as conclusion I came to as a consequence of it's size (it has to be 7x bigger than AAPL for a good reason, probably, and probably deserves an allocation in kind, unless it really is just an irrational overpriced torpedo).

It is overall a poor investment, but, it is probably better than some random stock someone might pick, it is uncorrelated which is a plus, and it is a sort of beta generating asset just the same for precious metals as The S&P500 is for equities, and Bitcoin is for crypto.  You'll probably get enough alpha from the Bitcoin alone and the S&P500, does the rest really matter that much?  I'm fairly confident if you just buy those 3 things, in really any amount, you'll probably do okay, it just makes sense to do it by market cap to me for simplicities sake (as the S&P500 is already somewhat set up that way).

I mean, things could change, interest rates very well could just keep going up and we're all doomed anyways and everything get's crushed, that's what the Floating Rate Notes are for.

It could be dumb, it could be an overallocation, it could be overpriced, but I really do think in general people are woefully underallocated to it, so maybe saying having such a large allocation will make someone think to at least consider *some*. If SCHG goes to zero, the entire US and probably the global economy would be in serious trouble, which is highly unlikely. But if BTC goes to zero, life goes on like nothing happened. ETF. Use GLD or IAU.

Physical gold costs to much to buy and sell. People say they can handle 50% drops….until it actually happens. During liberation day, the so called ‘long term investor’ suddenly became the crying ‘short term trader’ 

Anyway I’ll stop shit posting. Yes, SPY is good. Robinhood? At this time, I somehow think SCHD is better. VOO is already flying at 50000 ft high, maybe I am just not daring enough, but I really wonder how much higher can it go? That's why BRK keeps all those cash, but for us small time investors, I have no idea what we can do if we sit on our cash. It's surely a dilemma. Lastly, you can take the risk and you have time, but I worry if the next major crash can recover quickly as the past ones in the last couple decades. Who knows? I wish there was an answer somewhere.

1mjc4x3,2025-08-06,"AMD (AMD) $162, 5% lower after a decent beat and guidance.
08/05/2025

AMD (AMD) $162, 5% lower after a decent beat and guidance and upgrades from analysts.

**Looks like a classic sell on news after a meteoric 100% rise this year.**

**Overall, I had trimmed 30% of my position on Friday, and don’t plan to buy that back. Planning to hold on to the rest.**

1. AMD Q2 revenue of $7.685B, up 32% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter,  $270M beat over $7.415B estimates.
2. Better guidance for Q3 of $8.7B, up 13% quarter-over-quarter and up 28% year-over-year V consensus of  $8.323B. Mostly on data center growth from M1355 ramp up.
3. This does not include projected $1.5B of lost China revenue, which is still awaiting approval.
4. Market share gains over Intel in CPUS from EPYC server chips, and Ryzen client chips.
5. Gaming Radeon GPUs would have been better if not for supply constraints.
6. The weaker segments, embedded is finally turning around, while gaming will remain flat in Q3
7. Weak margins remain a key concern though, which has always been AMD’s weakness and reason for the poorer multiple and lower valuation.
8. There is widespread expectation that AMD would be able to raise AI GPU prices, which are still substantially cheaper than Nvidia’s Blackwell’s but there was no explicit confirmation during the earnings call - perhaps a reason for the drop,
9. Benchmark reiterated its Buy rating on AMD PT $210 from $170. KeyBanc maintained its Sector Weight rating on AMD. Oppenheimer kept its Perform rating on AMD's stock.Meanwhile, Mizuho raised the price target on AMD's stock to $183 from $175.

Diversify in your semis because upside surprise to nvidia is more limited. Invest on the expectations and tail events. My dad, who got his Econ phd back in the 60s, had a saying, buy on rumor, sell on facts. And I think that’s what we’re seeing here. But high, sell low, and buy again at almost double is the literal opposite of the strategy you should be following. AMD was a good stock when it traded on the success of their (gaming) GPU and desktop CPU business. Nowadays some expectations regarding data center growth are already priced in but AMD just does not deliver on that front.

1mjaw0p,2025-08-06,"How do tracking stocks have any value?
Consider Ramaco Resources, a metallurgical coal company and a rare earth play.  Their primary class A shares are listed under “METC”.  In addition, Ramaco offers a tracking stock,  class B shares under “METB”, which ostensibly exists to track the performance of the rare earths business.  

My understanding is that in general, tracking stocks like this have no voting rights and no claim to residual earnings.   Which causes me to wonder, how do these tracking shares have any value at all, and under what circumstances would I invest in METB instead of METC, if METC is the class of share that has a vote and a claim to profits?   

Ramaco can say METB tracks the rare earths business, but how is it anything more than a piece of paper to which the company arbitrarily assigns certain profit streams?

1mj9xz4,2025-08-06,"AMD Q2 Earnings was a headfake and why it’s trading at a discount now.
AMD reported earrings yesterday - here’s the recap.

	•	Revenue Beat: Q2 revenue hit $7.7B (+32% YoY), beating estimates of $7.4B, driven by strong client and gaming segments.

	•	EPS In Line: Adjusted EPS was $0.48, broadly in line with expectations, though margins compressed due to a $800M China-related export charge.

	•	Data Center Miss: Data center revenue rose 14% YoY to $3.2B, slightly below expectations ($3.3B), impacted by MI308 sales restrictions.

	•	Strong Q3 Guidance: AMD guided Q3 revenue to $8.7B, above consensus ($8.28B), led by AI chip ramp (MI350) and client/gaming strength.

Stock is down 8% today but I believe the market has wildly overreacted on the data center miss and the quarter over quarter decline.

Not going to get into the details and my thesis today, but beneath all the noise yesterday was this gem.

The release of ROCm 7.0 - AMD’s answer to Nvidia’s moat that is CUDA.

AMD is positioning itself to reap the benefits of the inference computing cost being the majority of where capex will be spent in the future on AI.

Think of Nvidia as providing the supercomputers for generating the weather models, but AMD wants to be the iPhone that just shows the weather app.

A bit of tangent but getting back to ROCm 7.0 - it’s 3.5x more powerful than its prior version.  That’s a significant leap forward and shows that AMD will be gaining traction with hyperscalers like META.

It’s not a matter of if, but when. That’s why I am doubling my AMD position today at these discounted prices.


Data center demand is through the stratosphere. The fact that they missed on data center revenue is a huge red flag I think. Data Center miss is due to the MI308 being restricted for sale into China. A few weeks ago (July), the administration said they plan to grant AMD an exemption going forward, which will then remove that obstacle.

If you listened to the earnings call, every metric from revenue to EPS, etc. included a statement showing what it would have been had China sales been included. With those numbers counted next quarter, things will improve dramatically :). It‘s everytime the same with Advanced Money Destroyer. There is always this „insignificant“ problem during earnings. It should be remediated fairly quickly. Sometimes it is sometimes it isn‘t. But one thing is for sure. The next little thing is waiting around the corner. 😃 [deleted] Nvidia said they would write off $15 billion in China sales and still increased data center revenue by more than all of what AMD collects. Nvidia is adding $3-5 billion in revenue every quarter and guided to that much growth even without China. There may be more growth and maybe the rising tide lifts AMD in the meantime, but Nvidia is winning now. I mean it missed data center expectations by 3% and it still grew 14% YoY. Doesn’t exactly seem like a problem or lack of demand


Overall revenue beat estimates by 4% with 32% growth. Guidance for Q3 beat estimates by 5%. 


These are numbers long term investors should be looking for. Look up AMD xilinx amortization as to why the pe is sp high It’s obvious to all that Nvidia is the leader - They have 80% of the market after all :).

That doesn’t mean, however, that their growth rate will ‘lead’ going forward. Most agree that AMD will take market share in the next 12-24 months due to an higher expected revenue growth rate in the next couple years. The MI 350 and MI 400 models coming out this Fall and next Fall will be the first actually competitive products they will have had vs. Nvidia. 

Were AMD to reduce Nvidia’s market share down to say 70% over the next two years that will have MASSIVE positive ramifications to AMD’s share price. You are correct on the numbers.

How does everyone love it but see no upside? Even weirder, the stock is up 171% in 2024 and another 25% in 2025, trading at 55.96 P/E with a $4 trillion market cap, most semiconductor peers trade at 15-30x earnings. $NVDA at nearly 56x is pricing in perfection for years.

The competition is real now. Huawei's Ascend chips are growing in China, and NVDA took a $5.5 billion charge on H20 chip restrictions, here ‘Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Stock Price Prediction for 2025: Where Will It Be in 1 Year (July 30) - 24/7 Wall St.’ Plus Microsoft announcing $30B quarterly capex, here ‘Meta, Microsoft stocks rise on strong earnings and AI spending boom,’ means everyone's building their own chips. How long before NVDA's moat erodes?

Some analysts see $5 trillion market cap potential, found here ‘Analysts raise Nvidia price targets after Trump's China chip decision. One sees $5 trillion market cap ahead,’ but 24/7 Wall St has a cautious $147.70 target - that's 15.8% downside, article found here ‘Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Stock Price Prediction for 2025: Where Will It Be in 1 Year (July 30) - 24/7 Wall St.’ That's a massive spread between bull and bear cases. 

92% of GPU sales. Do you expect GPUs to be bought this year? I do. Everyone has been greedy af for the past decade, imagine having been fearful lol I think nvidia is far ahead of the comp. They also have software and if AI is the future, then we are just at the beginning. If Microsoft is still thriving then nvidia has room to grow as well I doubt that they will see any meaningful competition in the short term.

But i am confident in being way too late to the party to see any meaningful gains by investing in them. I agree for the most part, looking to sell my NVDA holdings(50% profit) and hoping to enter back at a lower point. I've been invested in NVDA nearly 20 years.  What a post like this doesn't get is that Nvidia has nearly always been expensive.  DCF is not going to work, hasn't for the last 10 years.  Why?  Because Nvidia is out inventing markets that don't exist yet.   You will never be able to rationalize the investment. 

And it just goes on to continue to make new highs. 

Folks don't understand the technological leadership.  For example, yesterday Nvidia just made good on their promise for 30X performance improvement in their Blackwell chip.  Think about that.  All the smartest minds in technology investing, scheming, positioning against Nvidia and they come out with a product that blows their last generation (Hopper) out of the water not by 1 or 2X, by 30X -- all this while everyone (AMD, AWS, Google, Huawei, everyone) compares themselves, unfavorably for the most part, to Hopper. 

I've bet on the man, the CEO is every bit as talented at Jobs or Buffet.   He's made me very wealthy. Since I’m one of the few that actually works in AI on this forum, nobody is really competing with NVIDIA.  There’s some low end stuff from AMD for inference, but that’s about all it’s good for.  Nvidia has a massive advantage in both software and hardware and that’s the key factor. Be fearful when everyone is greedy Yes! but do you think they can hold onto this for next  5-10 years? Or even 3-5 years? Their backlog is less nowadays. To get H100's in any reasonable quantities was behind a long long wait

1mirjgt,2025-08-06,"Investment opportunities with weakening dollars?
What do you guys invest if dollar keeps weakening? 

1. Stick with US companies. 
Reasons: big companies especially tech companies have much revenue from foreign countries (e.g. Apple with more than 50%: https://myfinsight.com/aapl/income). The impact is mostly neutralized

2. Foreign stocks. 
Reasons: foreign assets convert back to US dollar become more valuable (e.g. CQQQ up 20% this year. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CQQQ/)

3. Gold, Bitcoin etc. 
Reasons: same as above.

eh. I don't think its the right time to throw money in.

We are at record highs with an idiot threatening the next great depression. Hard assets. I went big on precious metals this year. Those tend to do pretty well in a stagflation environment. Avoiding crypto like plague - if Jim Cramer is telling everyone to buy, I’m gonna do the opposite. !remindme 12 months lol fair enough Whatever problems you might think the us economy has the chinese one has ten times over. CQQQ is up 20% this year, great, now look at the 5 year graph. 

If you want to buy int stocks, that’s great, but why would you buy a single country when there are etf that diversify between multiple countries? What’s also interesting, if we look at the reality, with no fiat backing, crypto is worthless. People trade crypto as a proxy for fiat — primarily USD. Its value is directly proportional to its market capitalization per token. Crypto literally cannot function without fiat systems carrying the burden of exchange.

 A crypto token as a store of value is a laughable concept because how will anyone transfer the value of a gold bar via crypto, if the entire system is baseless???? Not happening. Crypto shills are wildly irrational and delusional people.

In reality, if everything crashed, cryptocurrencies are worthless. Your friends will not take your crypto, your grocery store will not take your crypto, the banks will not give you anything of value for your FartStinkPeePee coin.

Crypto has zero intrinsic value and real world utility. Crypto is relevant in the first-world because: it’s easy to commit securities fraud and get rich from it; and can be like trading collectibles. XRP is flat out securities fraud and every crypto ICO is just an unregistered securities offering scam. 

As banks slowly come online into the real-time transactions market, cryptocurrencies will lose their only possible exit strategies. 

IMHO, cryptocurrencies are just novelties. Having a serious crypto currency allocation is like putting all of your money into rare Pokémon cards hoping t get rich someday: it’s probably easy money for a while until the market finally wakes up , leaving you as a bag holder… don’t be exit liquidity. 

Crypto is this time periods “stamp collecting,” or “rare baseball card collection.” I didn’t mean it in that sense. China has a lot of, and that’s a lot, of systemic issues. Instead of investing in a Chinese etf I would recommend and etf that diversifies between multiple countries to reduce country risk. Real estate is the best inflation hedge.

It makes no sense.  VFV and VOO are both S&P500 funds.  Literally no reason to have both.

You seem to think adding more tickers adds more diversification.  That's not the case.  Scrapping all this and buying VT would be a more diversified portfolio.  Any deviation from that needs a good evidence based explanation.  Like chasing small/value premium or something.  There's no reason to prioritize ""growth"" stocks (XGRO).  They do not historically have higher returns than value. How did you choose those? Randomly? I don't know , we can't read your mind , you gotta give us some reasoning why you picked all of these funds Vfv and voo are functionally the same. 
Xef and vxus are similar. 

The rest is a crapshoot. I dunno what kind of portfolio you're constructing. No, you are way too heavily concentrated in growth/tech which are highly correlated. This is a well-diversified portfolio for a beginner. Consider adding some bonds (BND) for stability as you gain more experience. /r/Bogleheads and the 3 fund portfolio.

Diversification does not need to be complicated. Growth has killed value for the past 15 years. I get the dilemma that ""over a long time"" yada yada yada. But you may be waiting a long time before this becomes a real long term trend that value outperforms.

Part of the issue is that the way that ""value"" is calculated as a factor for ETFs is very limited, ignores so many other important factors you would normally account for in value investing, and still has a ton of market risk due to generally higher debt levels and more pro-cyclicality in the value sector.",6,0.75,8,0,Front_Bat3307,investing,['MSFT'],diversifying properly wealthsimple account invested following 700 xgro 150 vfv 100 voo 100 xefto 100 vxus 50 figma 50 msft 50 apple 50 nvidia 50 exxon mobil 50 goog investing sectors niches taking much risk advice could nice started investment journey month ago makes sense vfv voo sp500 funds literally reason seem think adding tickers adds diversification thats case scrapping buying vt would diversified portfolio deviation needs good evidence based explanation like chasing smallvalue premium something theres reason prioritize growth stocks xgro historically higher returns value choose randomly dont know cant read mind gotta give us reasoning picked funds vfv voo functionally xef vxus similar rest crapshoot dunno kind portfolio youre constructing way heavily concentrated growthtech highly correlated welldiversified portfolio beginner consider adding bonds bnd stability gain experience rbogleheads 3 fund portfolio diversification need complicated growth killed value past 15 years get dilemma long time yada yada yada may waiting long time becomes real long term trend value outperforms part issue way value calculated factor etfs limited ignores many important factors would normally account value investing still ton market risk due generally higher debt levels procyclicality value sector

1mi3njz,2025-08-05,"Buying Foreign Inflation-Protected Bonds as a US Investor?
I'm about 10 years from retirement and have been slowly building a ladder of individual TIPS to hold to maturity to cover basic expenses between retirement and claiming Social Security (roughly 2035 to 2050).  Now that it's clear that the current US regime will fire statisticians that make it look bad, I'm reconsidering whether US TIPS will be a reliable hedge against inflation over the near to medium term.

Do any US investors on this sub buy foreign inflation-protected bonds?  ETFs available for this purpose seem to have relatively high expense ratios, and of course you're stuck with the duration of whatever the given fund has chosen.  And as far as buying individual foreign bonds to hold to maturity, (1) I'm not sure the extent to which you can do that from a US-based Schwab/Fidelity/Vanguard account, (2) there's currency risk, and (3) deciding which bonds to buy from which countries seems like a bit of a headache.

Other than foreign inflation-hedged bonds, I seem to have two options.  First, pause purchase of new TIPS for a few years and put all new money into equities, accepting increased volatility in exchange for something that's a more reliable inflation hedge.

Second, make no changes.  Continue buying TIPS as previously planned, because there's no cost-effective way to mitigate the risk of political manipulation of the CPI calculation (or maybe trusting that the market will incorporate that risk into the purchase price for TIPS on the secondary market going forward).  This has the virtue of being the least market-time-y option.

What do you think?
I don't see why the inflation rate for a country you don't live in would be relevant to you. Yeah i wouldn't. Maaaybe when the dollar was extra strong compared to Euro, but it's not anymore. A lot of countries don't even have TIPS afaik. There are a dozen or so countries that offer them, but this specific problem might not be one with a cost-effective solution.  

Also, foreign inflation-protected bonds only help in a scenario where US inflation is lower or the same as ex-US, US inflation numbers are manipulated, and ex-US numbers aren't.  They don't help if, for example, US inflation is significantly higher than ex-US inflation. True.

1mhppwu,2025-08-04,"What factors to consider while selling TIPS ?
I bought some TIPS, by mistake ( got confused on the treasury website where i actually wanted to buy a Series I bond, during the high yield years)

**Question** \- what factors to consider if I should sell these at a loss (may be to harvest stock gains) ? Should i persist for some 'x' amount of time, before throwing in the towel (and may be buy NVDA to cover up for all the losses :D )
If you still feel that way, and feel like your money is better elsewhere (or in cash) then there shouldn't be any reason to keep them. The only thing you would be losing are the 3 years of maturity you've ""earned"" on them, but you could say that wasn't worth the price you paid, so far.

However, if you have the time, here's a post by Jurrien Timmer that might give you some more insight: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/closer-mile-week-8425-jurrien-timmer-snkre/?trackingId=wDNgBk%2B%2BSAqR2D%2F3hUCxSg%3D%3D

> The soft jobs data pushed the forward curve back down to 3%, with the market now expecting the next rate cut in September.  With the TIPS break-even curve stable at the 2.50-2.75% range, in my view a neutral policy would be around 3.50-3.75%.  That means that the market is expecting that the Fed will go past neutral and into the accommodative zone. Hypothetically, if you had not taken any losses (or hypothetical gains), would you spend your current balance on TIPS today?
If yes, what would be your time horizon, x? What is the year to date return? Any bond purchased at the beginning of 2022 will have lost value as that was one of the worst years for bonds. But, they should be doing OK recently.

When do they mature? 

Are they in an IRA or 401K?  TIPS can be a bit of a pain in terms of taxes if in a taxable brokerage account due to ""tips phantom tax"". They went down in value because yields(future expected return) went up. Yields and prices are inverse of each other.

TIPS had negative yields at the time you bought them, but at current prices, they yield about 1.5-2% + inflation.

Buying Nvidia wont magically fix your mistake unless you have a time machine. It's already had its run. ha, i would probably never have bought TIPS, bought it by mistake originally :( it matures in 2032 (10 year TIPS bought in 2022) and is in taxable brokerage

1mgwm23,2025-08-03,"""At that P/E rate, it would take 'X' years to recoup your investment""
I heard this today on a video about palantir. The guy said it has a P/E of 670, meaning it would take you 670 YEARS to get your money back.

I searched google and had a long conversation with ChatGPT that went nowhere. I now understand P/E ratios when it comes to ""*A P/E of 670 means you pay $670 for every $1 the company earns annually""* because I heard a great vending machine analogy and I read a comparison about Microsoft.

(**Machine** **costs $2,000 up front. makes $200 a year; P/E = 10x**).

What I **don't** understand is the notion that it would take **ME,** the **STOCK INVESTOR**, that much time.

I feel blindsighted by the fact that the only money I will ever see is from when the value of the stock goes up.

The ""670 years"" thing to me makes no sense. Not that it makes no sense, as in I understand where it's coming from, but it's just untrue to me. It makes no sense **simply because I don't get it**, and can't find any resources that know what I mean when posing my question.

The root of my problem may be my ability to explain my confusion, but I tried to do my best to put it all together here, and the clarity seems perfect to me. Maybe the issue is everyone takes this phrase a face value and doesn't think about its meaning?... Idk.

The vending machine analogy was a great way for me to understand it when it comes to someone who actually gets the profit, but I'm completely failing to comprehend its connection to investing.

(Video with timestamp for context: https://youtu.be/raE9f9swVxU?si=UgpbCeGxiwqEY20G&t=666)
In the old days, people used to invest in stocks primarily to get a dividend, which is a share of profit you receive proportional to your ownership stake (i.e. number of stocks).  Most companies these days reinvest their profits into growth (or use profit to buy back shares) rather than distribute dividends to shareholders.

When they say it would take you X years to ""get your money back,"" they mean at current earnings your proportion of the profits would take X years to pay back the capital you spend to buy the stock.  It has nothing to do with selling the stock. And that X years calculation assumes that earnings stay exactly the same, which most people are betting is not the case. If the company continued to make the same profit now into eternity, it would take 670 years to recoup your investment because you’re paying 670 years of profits discounted to present value It is confusing because there are two (theoretical) ways to make money investing - receiving dividends/profit directly, and appreciation of the stock price.  They are loosely related, in that the more profitable a company is, the more valuable it is perceived to be.

Historically, P/E ratio was a method to determine how valuable a particular stock was relative to other stocks, and for decades has been a bedrock of stock valuation.  Seen from the perspective of someone chasing dividends, it makes perfect sense - if two stocks have the same P/E ratio, your dividend per dollar invested should be the same for both stocks.

In more modern times, stock price appreciation has overtaken dividends as the primary way that people make money from stocks. It is essentially speculation, betting that the stock price will increase for various reasons, as opposed to the more antiquated sort of investing that expected a relatively constant profit from an established company.

In the last 30 years, P/E ratios have increasingly diverged from stock prices.  Stock valuations have become increasingly speculative, i.e. not based on any fundamental principles but on the expectation of future profit.  I suspect much of this is driven by the massive increase in currency supply - there is simply a lot of money circulating in the economy that has been created out of thin air, and only so many places to put it where it won't rot with inflation.  It'll keep working until it doesn't. This is it. It also is the stepping stone question as to how does growth factor into valuing a stock. 670 p/e is awful if 0 growth. Now if you have 200% growth, possibly undervalued. Then you start looking to ROI and MEROI Let’s suppose you don’t buy a stock. You buy the whole company. And you want 100% of the profits to your pocket.

It would take you 670 years until you can get your money back. This is the most clear answer ive seen so far. The idea is still a bit foggy but getting cleared. I think one of the roots of the problem is how the guy used the phrase/ the context he said it. 

  
I put a link to the video and timestamp at the bottom, id love it if you could give it a watch and help me understand if this notion is true To be a worthy investment, you want your rate of return to be higher than the risk-free rate. If your hypothetical investment grows at 2% per year, you're better off just buying bonds or treasuries.


And since a total stock market index fund is basically the baseline longterm investment vehicle for most people nowadays, you really need your investments to beat the total market index--otherwise you're just better off in the index.


But investing based off of anticipated future share prices isn't investing, it's speculating. When you invest in a company, you're offering up your money today in exchange for anticipated future profits. P/E captures that perfectly, and share prices typically move in tandem with projected forward earnings.


Palantir is sustaining a 600x P/E because it is expected to grow its earnings substantially in the near-term. If Palantir's earnings double every year for the next 4 years (which is basically what's being projected by buyers), it'll have a 37.5 P/E, which is a reasonable P/E for a blue chip growth company.


Something like bitcoin has no anticipated future profits because it generates no earnings. Its price is totally dependent on the greater fool theory--speculation that someone someday will pay you more than you already paid. There is nothing like P/E for bitcoin because bitcoin has no value other than your hope that someone else will buy it from you in the future. Welcome to 2025 where a vast majority of the best stocks have insanely high P/Es It’s not a lie. It’s about the fundamental value of a stock. 

It’s about putting things into perspective, and making you ask yourself if something is overvalued. You wouldn’t pay a kid $67,000 for their lemonade stand just because they profited $100 selling lemonade for a year (this is basically what Palantir is valued at now). You would have to expect the kid to start selling way way more lemonade in the future to justify this price.

Would you invest into the kid’s lemonade business at this valuation? Why do you think Palantir is different?

Some investments are less about fundamentals and believing the asset/business is going to earn money, and more about the assumption someone else will buy it from you again for a hopefully bigger price at some point (greater fool theory). Like expensive paintings, bitcoin, tesla, palantir, gamestop, etc. And, following your point, sometimes you have a 100/1 P/E with 1000% growth and yet it's overvalued.

1mgl5qe,2025-08-03,"Bearish on Tesla - tell me why I am wrong!
I own a model Y and a few Tesla stocks but I am increasingly finding it challenging to see how the current valuation is sensible.

- Cars - Margin pressure is not going away. Sit in a BYD car and you will know why. Tesla remains strong but will not have market dominance especially as both legacy, Chinese and Korean makers catch up. Look at market share in EU and China. Superchargers are great but still are primarily used during trips. I did a roadtrip in Germany and every place I stayed in had a charger. Used superchargers twice and they were 20% occupancy. My take is you add the market cap of bmw, Mercedes and VW and add a buffer you are looking at 200b.
- Robotaxi - there is potential here but seriously they have competition. Also assume Tesla Robotaxi is 50% the size of Uber (which is a globally scaled brand and did 11 billion trips and has a thriving food delivery business) the market cap is 100b
- Optimus prime - at best it's a 10b valuation because it's so early in it's product life cycle. Google and look at the competition. The Chinese are a formidable force with immense support from their government.
- Solar - it's cool, but at this point it's a primarily US product with competition.

Overall, if I am being generous, it's a $400b company. 

Tell me what justifies the $1t market cap. So many people can't be wrong, so I must be missing something really basic. Some analysts are saying it will almost double from current levels. 
You’re wrong because it’s a meme stock, it’s price isn’t based on the realities of the business “Tell me what justifies the $1t market cap”

Nothing. 

“So many people can't be wrong”

Yes they can.

Be careful betting against Tesla. The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent You're not wrong, but good luck making money shorting it. Tesla trades irrationally and best to just ignore it. You’re not wrong When you have tens of thousands of disaffected young men, with nothing going for them in life, who have bought high and invested their identity in a cult of personality, the rational markets hypothesis goes out the window. This is the real answer. what does that have to do with what I said? I’m not suggesting anyone should buy the stock or anything Another day, another Tesla or Google post. Well one mistake is you’re seeing the Uber business and robotaxi as 1-1 in terms of market value. If autonomous vehicles do become a thing it will be transformative because of ease of use, cost, privacy, etc. This will cause the ride hailing business to massively increase.

I think this is what the OP is trying to say. Gonna need more risk if you're targeting 20M after one year IVV and A200 already give you strong US and Australian exposure, but adding an international ETF covering Europe and Asia would diversify your portfolio and reduce home bias.

>	vanguard institutional total international stock market index trust. 

While you are correct that they are not *exactly* the same, the difference in performance will be negligible to VTSNX.

So just use VTSNX as a surrogate. I track all of my investments from my retirement account and individual accounts on google sheets.  For those funds that are offered in my retirement account that are not publicly available, I track them by finding another fund that tracks the same thing (if possible), try to compute a multiple of the difference between their two prices (usually based upon past close prices), and then in google sheets I take the publicly traded fund, modify it by the computed multiple, and it then gives me a close approximation of what the actual fund is doing. Some banking/brokerage apps let you track balances of 3rd party brokerage accounts. Another option could be to rollover/transfer everything into VG, where your 401(k) is, since Fidelity Roth IRA isn’t tied to employer. For aggregating everything in one place, a lot of people have success with services like Personal Capital (now Empower Personal Dashboard) or Kubera. They both have their strengths. Empower is great for a free, high-level overview and retirement planning, while Kubera is a paid service but can track a wider variety of assets, including crypto and international accounts. Have you looked into either of those, and what are the main features you're hoping to get from an aggregator? I have the same issue with a Vanguard target date fund. In my aggregated online setup I use the symbol available for the fund as a placeholder for the institutional version. But, when I manually update, I take the dollar value of the institutional shares and divide by the current price of the symbol I have access too and use that as the number of shares to enter in the aggregated online setup. When done after hours, and done correctly, the two will show the same value. There is a slight drift across a month's time and I just correct for it monthly when manually updating the aggregated list.

In terms of back-dating, I'm not sure you can do that using my approach due to the ""drift"". Perhaps if you had the total value 1.5 years back? Still, re-invested dividends, and other investments over time would probably not be correctly accounted for. but will it muddy the accuracy of the analysis since the share price is different between the two?

Unfortunately 403B is very hard to get data readily available unless you give us your access (don’t). It’s very hard to map the funds to a public ticker. 

I suggest you approach it to take is write down the allocation numbers for your existing funds and funds of interest. Focus on 2 primary groups of allocation 
- stock weight and bond weight 
- stock country or just region weights (US, Euro, Asia, etc)
- set 2 targets 
  - what’s your desired asset allocation. (90 stock/10 bond)
  - what’s your desired geographic allocation (within stocks 50 US, 50 intl?)
- look at the funds that can get you to it and rebalance to that weightings. 
- there are some math you’ll have to do to calculate how much dollar value is 90% stock and so on. 
- those 2 high level allocation weight generally drives a lot of your risk profile.


Add on: you can probably achieve target with as little as 3 funds. Try to keep it super simple and not over complicate it.

I've been invested in this for several years at this point. A quick Google search reveals (and has already been news for a while at this point) Monogram's 510(k) approval.

The last three milestones are contingent on increasing gross revenue by December 2028, 2029 and 2030, and I do believe have not been hit yet, so I didn't include them here.

Am I wrong in thinking that when this deal closes, I should receive pretty much immediately $4.04+$1.04+$1.08 for each of my shares?

1mf0udr,2025-08-01,"CVX at $100 is my target for a buy
I wouldn't pay more than $100 for CVX. I'm gonna get that buy zone soon enough. Aramco is on my side, they are dumping the oil market and it'll catchup to the US soon.

At $100 though, CVX would be a great buy.

I think the capital structure of the oil majors is fine, I just think their ""driller's treadmill"" is too severe right now and doesn't justify the price. $XLE is way too expensive. $CVX is my favored of the pack. But I think $XOM is slightly stronger but is too greedy with their cashflow as a shareholder.

There's other better oil companies down the stream but I prefer to stay in the majors.

OII is a great oil play for instance at the technical level. But I never bought it even though I check it time to time for health of the industry since they rely so much on ROVs.
I’m highly skeptical you’ll see CVX at $100/share, but if you do, I’ll be right there buying with you. You have to go back around 3 or so years to find that price.

Out of all the US oil companies, vertically integrated XOM/CVX are the best able to weather a storm. The smaller upstream players like FANG and OXY are the ones that technically will see margin pressures.

At the end of the day, O&G is cyclic and the way these companies handle markets being flooded is to cut working capital (layoffs) and shutdown wells (which will actually hurt the economy)

1memyer,2025-08-01,"Some people treating Amazon, UNH or even UPS as a Mullen, AMC kind of stock.
Come on people….! 

They are making money. Stop moaning about all those great businesses. 

I saw one post today saying “Amazon is real crap stock” 

And the same person holding AMC/GME in his/her portfolio. 

Really?

Just stay away from individual stocks if you can’t handle the volatility. 




Amazon is real crap stock and I hope it crashes back to under $100...

so I can buy more hahaha I think it’s less about not wanting to hold individual stocks but rather people complaining that the stocks they have don’t make short term gains while the internet and reddit are constantly shoving news about stocks moving 5, 10, even 100% in a few days. I’m sure a lot of people had fomo when OPEN DNUT all spiked Does it matter if it's profitable but drops 60% ? This, that’s the plan…! Yes you should like it *more* after the drop not less UPS is up 20% from where it IPO'd about 25 years ago. It's not a 0 tomorrow or anything of that nature, but its not good either and when they announce that they're going to lose half the business of their largest customer (Amazon) by 2H26,  I don't know what entirely replaces that. Carol Tome is a good CEO but I don't know what someone can do to transform what UPS is at this point. 

UNH is a situation where people think that buy the dip mentality can be applied across the board when household names decline but in this case when people don't take the time to understand the dynamics of the intentionally very complex insurance industry, they're not getting the full picture - then the stock goes down another $50.  And then another peer reports lousy earnings too and they all go down further. NVO has gotten short-term too oversold /obliterated but that's another name where Reddit thought buy the dip without really getting the full picture of why the decline happened would work. It went down 21% the other day after they lowered guidance for the second time in three months and so far...has just kept heading South. 

AMZN being down is an instance where people's investment time horizon has become ""until the line stops going up."" People on here are waaaaaayyyyyy more ultra short term then they were several years ago.  Stock is still up 21% YTD and yet there's going to be so much complaining that it's down. People complain about GOOG incessantly and it's like, ""Okay, sell it and buy something else""- and they never want to.

 I will say that AMZN's perforomance over the last 5 years is ... not great. Plus, I'm sure Bezos has more to sell. Earnings beating the estimate and it’s down after hours makes no sense. That’s become the norm lately. Great quarter. Profits and it sinks the following day. Fundamentals aren’t what they use to be  UPS is hamstrung by higher labor costs due to their Teamsters contracts.  Amazon is non-Union in its warehouses and uses non-Union drivers and gig workers.  No pension payments, lower healthcare, etc.  It used to be that UPS had the established local infrastructure to be the only game in town (USPS aside).  Now that Amazon built out local infrastructure, it does not need UPS. How is UPS not a crap stock. Been going down since like 2020. Think it’s back to the same levels in 2012. I will admit that when I started trading, that kind of stuff caught my eye all the time.  Didn't study the market with any depth, and bought a bunch of penny level biotech stocks.

1mehsu8,2025-08-01,"Would You Rather Hold NVDA or VOO for the Next 6 Months?
From what I have seen since pre-covid, capital is constantly flowing from one sector to another. I don't believe diversifying into different companies, is as important as the actual sector or asset class.

For example, US stock market was down bad in first 2 quarters because of tariffs, but gold was doing well. Had you sold off all your stocks when the market was on a downward trend, you would have dry powder to rotate your money to where capital is flowing, which was gold.  

Right now, AI and Tech has momentum again and in my opinion, it's better to hold NVDA instead of VOO since VOO lumps in low performers to help you ""diversify"".

But that doesn't even mean anything if the entire market crashes. NVDA is S&P 1 so it's not like you're throwing into unproven companies, and it certainly has a lot more to gain from the momentum than VOO.

Thoughts?
This is the repeat question of individual stocks vs index funds VOO; holds plenty of NVDA already along with everything else. Look at the top S&P500 stocks from 2010, 2000, 1990, 1980 and see if they’re still near the top. Both No one knows.

1megpzy,2025-07-31,"AMD will reprice during earnings next week. Most still won’t understand why.
My tech earnings calls this quarter have been accurate (GOOGL, MSFT, META, RDDT). AMD is next.

What’s being missed:

AMD is gaining quiet traction from Nvidia in segments that care about control and efficiency - specifically open-source AI deployments. That preference isn’t ideological, it’s architectural.

The core demand is coming from three categories:

	1.	Sovereign buyers (EU, Middle East) who won’t bet their AI stack on a black-box vendor.

	2.	Hyperscalers (MSFT, META, Oracle) selectively onboarding AMD into their model training workflows to reduce vendor lock-in.

	3.	Startups and smaller firms where unit economics matter, and AMD’s open-source orientation offers clear flexibility advantages.

The idea that Nvidia has a permanent hardware monopoly is a form of mental laziness. AMD doesn’t need to “beat” Nvidia - it only needs to absorb the non-Nvidia demand that’s scaling underneath the narrative.

The market is large. The shift is already happening.
Most investors are still pricing AMD as if it isn’t.

No ones missing it bro, they just don’t value AMD. I’ve been a big holder of AMD since 1.89/ share. No one listened back then and they are doing the same now. 

In the end they will see what has been there all the way since 2015… I’m long lol Alright bro 80% of tech stock has been up after earnings calm down CUDA is NVDA’s biggest moat at this point. Does your “open source AI deployments” address that? Or is that just a phrase that looks like it means something until someone with any domain specific knowledge looks at it.

I’m long AMD but let’s be realistic about the size of the gaps here. I was dropped on my head as a child I held NVDA since 2008. I've sold it all now. I still have all my AMD. > The idea that Nvidia has a permanent hardware monopoly is a form of mental laziness. AMD doesn’t need to “beat” Nvidia

The problem with this theory is that the companies buying AMD GPUs don’t know what they are doing because, if they did, they’d buy Nvidia GPUs instead as that is what their competitors are doing. These companies won’t last compared to those doing business with Nvidia.

If you don’t work in this field and just listen to conference calls you have no idea the lead and capabilities Nvidia offers over… Well everyone.

I think AMD offers value in the CPU space over Intel. That is their strength but their support sucks for Enterprise. AMD in my mind has turned into a prosumer company. I love them in custom white label server/home builds. Would I spend hundreds of millions building a data center using them for CPUs and GPUs. I don’t think so. Big “That preference isn’t ideological, it’s architectural.”

Isn’t this bot language? Various sections seem like what a LLM would produce plus the post history spamming the same posts to multiple subs isn’t a good sign. Who is going to bet 1-5GW deployments on hardware nobody has deployed before?

Hyperscalers deploy according to customer demand. It is lacking for anything non-nvidia. See previous point about trust when allocating capex/opex.

AMD is not “open source” in the way you’re talking about it. These products are ultimately export controlled so nothing is open source. 

AMD currently lacks rackscale products but they are on the horizon. Whether they execute well, remains unknown. This goes beyond the specs of individual chips.

All that being said, I do think AMD will eventually grab market share. It just won’t be this earnings. 2027 maybe.

1meeasm,2025-07-31,"META will have to stop buybacks or offer debt to offset AI investment cost
https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000162828025036719/meta-06302025xexhibit991.htm

Page 7 ""Condensed consolidated statement of cash flows"".

In 2025 META has spent $46B on investment activities on the back of $50B in net cash provided by operating activities.  In q2 investment activities was $300M more than cash provided by operating activities ($25.6b v $25.9B)

They have also spent $35B on financing activities in 2025, $22B from buying back stock.  In q2 $16B was used for financing activities $10B from buybacks.

This has drained their cash and equivalent position by just over $30B in 2025.  To continue to fund their AI investments which are supposed to be another $30B for q3/4 and then $60B in 2026 they will have to stop the buybacks or take on debt.
I mean one of the benefits of doing buy backs vs dividends is investors do not tend to revolt if you need to stop by backs

In theory a company should do buy backs when they have excess cash and no where else to deploy it. if they find something to deploy it on (expansion , acquisitions ) well stop the buy backs

Now you can argue if AI is worth it, but META seems to think it is, and investors seem to be bullish on AI so I don't see this being an issue in the short term. These companies have very low leverage, adding $50-150B in debt is 100% on the table. One thing to keep in mind is that the hefty employee compensation commonly includes stocks for meta. The buybacks ideally maintain the same dilution levels at a minimum to prevent that from affecting valuations. It's a major thing to keep in mind for tech stocks. I think it will actually be well received, these companies have been adverse to employing much debt. But debt is a powerful tool. They can use it to fund projects but also to buy back more stock and pay dividends. Signally that they are open to using debt aggressively when it's called for is a good thing IMO. 

If they were not printing money in their core business it would be a major red flag but they are making more money than they ever had by far. I agree I think it'll move the market when people hear a ""cash printer"" is having to leverage up maybe I'm wrong? If you are ignoring their markable securities (35B) and the additional 16B they invested in their non-marketable securities then sure.

Their CFO is very good. Companies generally don't want to tie themselves down unless they have to. There is limited value in telling the market we will issue debt in 6-18 months when maybe something changes between now and then. If you compare the market value of the equity, $50B in debt is immaterial. So there is no cause for markets to worry about how they will come up with it. 

I can tell you, some long credit managers are salivating at the idea of being able to buy up lots of 20-30 year bonds from FB, Amazon, MSFT. 

There will be ample demand for their bonds at even only a small spread over treasuries. 

Now, the biggest risk is that these investments don't translate into any meaningful revenue. And if that happens, paying for them is not going to be the concern, it's what that means for these company's long term future. Or increase cash from operations which is what they are doing. There's no doubt about it - the CAPEX in Big Tech right now is completely unaffordable. Because I think Ai is the next ""nuclear bomb"" I think a lot of it is driven by national policy and not by commonsense.

Acquiring the ability to make nuclear bombs or civilian nuclear power didn't make any company ""astronomically rich"".

Ai is going to end up being just as necessary, powerful a weapon that does very little to the bottom line.

These companies have to be subsidized at some point or they will all implode like INTC. There is a 1% tax on stock buybacks, but it is based on net buybacks.

1me9j08,2025-07-31,"Nvidia’s China-bound H20 AI chips face Beijing scrutiny over ‘tracking’ and security concerns
You know how the US has been concerned about how Chinese technology may have security concerns. That Chinese tech is spyware. It seems the Chinese have the same concern about US tech. They are now openly looking into whether they can trust Nvidia GPUs. With the US history of putting backdoors into US tech before shipping it overseas, that seems to be a reasonable concern. Will the Chinese actually allow the H20 to be sold in China? I guess this explains why no Chinese company has applied to get an export license for the H20.

https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/31/china-probes-nvidia-h20-chips-for-tracking-risks.html
lol Murican politicians literally called for planting tracking and backdoor into NVDA cards days ago. The H20 is not the ""most powerful chips in the world"". The Huawei 910C/920 is just as powerful. So they aren't beggars. They have their own solution. Thus why they are putting up barriers to the H20. Since they really don't need it. This isn't the first barrier. Before we even put up the export ban, China was already talking about banning the H20 due to it being so power inefficient. It’s just an attempt at Astro turfing reddit to make people believe that China is ahead of the United States in every aspect, very common from Canadian-Chinese immigrants. Again you’re attempting to Astro turf on reddit just look at your account it is completely bias towards… again CHINA. 


There’s a lot more to the chips than just manufacturing and China clearly cannot keep up otherwise they would not be batting an eye at Taiwan which they want for chips. > If they had other chips available they wouldn’t be crying about this and just outright ban the chips.

They aren't crying about it.

> China cannot produce similar chips to nvidia and that is fact.

The fact is China can. As in they actually produce their own chips. They don't rely on a third party to produce it. Nvidia doesn't make anything. It needs TSMC to make their chips for them. Huawei makes it's own chips. Those are the facts.

https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/huawei-already-has-a-new-chip-to-rival-nvidia-ai-gpus If all the want is the H100, then why do they want it at all? Since the 910C can match the H100. The 920 should be able to beat it.

The H100 is 2 gens old. Behind Grace and Blackwell. Even Jensen says that China's own chips are only 1 gen behind Nvidia. *""Anyone who discounts Huawei and anyone who discounts China's manufacturing capability is deeply naive.""*

[Jensen Huang, CEO of NVIDIA](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202507/1338520.shtml) Huawei allowed intelligence services, particularly British intelligence, access so they could see if there were any security concerns.

1me96vx,2025-07-31,"Shorting a little more SPY
With shorting you start small and if it keeps working then keep building the position. Not quite the same as DCA'ing into longs where, for me at least, I just have target portfolio allocations and add in bulk when able or when the price looks right.

But, today SPY looks like it's just weakening before August and will retest the 100 day moving average which is below 200 day moving average. Price ALWAYS retests 100day moving average if it crosses above 200day.

So this type of trade is now seeming high probability.

I use call-credit spreads to make synthetic shorts. This way I can control break-even cost basis. I'm keeping my cost basis a nice healthy \~3-5% higher than the current price.

So far this has been generating more and more money lately so it fits the ""if it's working add to it"" maxim of short trading.

I can remain ""mid-to-long term bullish"" but still keep a short-term bearish outlook because of that fact that price always retests the 100day crossing above 200day area.

But, in actuality unless the market has a healthy pullback and soon, I'm extremely long-term bearish because rate cuts will hit the market like a ton of bricks, flood the housing market with supply, dump prices all across the board and reveal just how weak the economy really is as equity in many asset classes goes into the toilet.

We aren't there yet. Fed keeps delaying Armageddon by a month at a time, like Trump says: ""See you in September"".

Yes by then the global economy is probably a dumpster fire and Powell will look like a fool waiting that long to cut.
A call credit spread isn't a synthetic short. It has a very different p/l curve at expiration than an actual synthetic short. 

How do you expect long term rates to react if the Fed actually cuts the overnight rate? 

Longer term rates are market driven. And iirc - the last rate cut didn't really have much impact on the 10 and 20 year. I think those rates actually went up when the short term rates were cut. It matters to people that don't understand the differences. I use both synthetic shorts and call credit spreads regularly. They serve different purposes.

If your goal was to reduce the delta of an existing long SPY position - using a synthetic short, short combo, or call credit spread have very different P/L curves and serve different purposes.

Your comments and posts are very laissez-faire in style. But I recognize what you are actually trying to do. But these kinds of rambling posts and comments will not be helpful to most people. That is the nature of derivatives. Yes - it is all synthetic. But the term ""synthetic short"" normally introduces a collar to an existing position. A call credit spread doesn't have the same collar effect. And it can require different types of management. 

As an active trader - you likely understand how to adjust the trades. 

But in this subreddit - most people will not understand what you mean. If you don't take the time to be specific and you are simply posting whatever comes to mind - it's not going to be well received in this subreddit. Feel like I'm watching the first act of *Bad Lieutenant* To expand on my use of ""synthetic"" it's because everything is all the same. You can make a ""synthetic"" position equal whatever you want it to be. It can be long, short, Beta 1.0 to Spy, or beta 0.5, or beta 2.0. Etc etc.

It can cost prime+2% interest, it can cost 1% interest. I think it's important to realize that you can just do whatever and it's all the same.

You can turn ""GLD"" into ""SPY"" if you wanted, it's all ""synthetic"" to me. The 10 or 30 won’t start serious movement until this tariff BS is handled. I see your point, but 2026 we get a new Fed chair and we know who they’ll be loyal to and what that person wants. Food for thought, it’s different times. Regarding rates - the last rate cut had the EXPECTED impact that any first rate cuts have, go look through history - mark first rate cuts on a chart and just watch what happens. The first rate cuts especially in an early phase of a business cycle tend to do ""nothing"" to rates. And long-duration rates tend to just be volatile.

We've seen that exact behavior.

All rates form a ""price curve"" if you want to chart it where they do what I call ""cheese knife"". The look like a cheese knife as they get to a ceiling. Look at a 1month rate and you'll see it looks like that as it approaches the Fed Funds rates.

Long duration rates do it too, it just takes longer and has bigger volatility, as expected.

We are now in the ""end"" of the cheese knife phase for long-duration. When the Fed starts cutting again it'll be chasing the long-duration curve. Let me be less hostile, I called it synthetic because it's a manufactured short position, not a bought short shares paying interest. The interest on short shares and the defined risk on a credit call spread is the same difference. The actual ""resulting expiration price"" would be your paid-interest if any. It's all the same stuff.

Whether or not it behaves like short shares is irrelevant. That's just ""beta"" or deviation from expected return to some index.

With the latest tech earnings yesterday  blowing it out of the park and much more growth anticipated. Where are we even going from here?  Markets are at all time highs, mainly from tech.  All of them are so highly valued right now. I would like to invest more but how much higher can they go before it drops?

 Rates will not come down because GDP numbers show growth and tarrifs putting pressure on this to raise prices too. Although it seems retail is absorbing the costs for now, I anticipate they won't for much longer.

I won't talk about crypto or stablecoins here

Can't beat the fixed income rates now though especially for ones closer to or at retirement.

Rest in cash/money market at 25%

The money thinks the market is good.

You can disagree with that if you want, but the signals all show they believe the AI is a boom, not a bubble. Except that they generated $3,000,000,000 of unexpected revenue.

1mdva00,2025-07-31,"Is it worth buying a hedged ETF for 3/4x the total expense ratio?
So basically I was thinking about buying an S&P 500 ETF (leaning towards the SPDR Acc.) which has a 0.03% ter. However most of the etfs similar to this one are all currency unhedged. I live in Europe so I use EUR. Is it worth buying the iShares Hedged etf (IUSE) for 0.2% ter, but having the peace of mind that it is currency hedged? Or is the ETF being unhedged not something I should really worry about? Thanks.
it is something you should worry about.  But imo the USD is done falling against the Euro.  The difference between .03 and .12 isn't a huge sum either way, so whatever makes you sleep better at night, would be my answer. Yeah, currency risk is definitely real. I'd agree the USD has probably bottomed out against EUR for now. The expense difference is minimal in the grand scheme - we're talking about a 0.09% difference annually. If hedging helps you avoid panic selling during currency swings, that peace of mind is worth the small premium. Just pick one and start investing,  that's what matters most. Long term always unhedged for me I'm unsure whether the USD will fall against the Euro, but then again I think the difference between 0.03 and 0.20 is quite significant. If for the sake of the argument one makes 1000 euro in profits, a 2euro cut vs a 0.3 euro cut is relatively significant.

** Edited the amounts cause they were calculated wrong which also made me realise how insignificant it is. Yeah. Either way I'll be in for the long run, so I'm guessing things will even out either way. 200 on 1000 would be 20%, not 0.20% ChatGPT can't do even basic math.

1mdsoia,2025-07-31,"Could tariffs be good for Amazon?
So in the lead up to earnings there has been a lot of talk about what to expect. Seems to me the two main themes have been:

- AWS should continue with huge growth, as we’ve seen from Google and msft’s earnings reports with their cloud sectors reporting 32% and 34% YoY rev increases.

- Tariffs will have hit the retail side of the business and could mean figures come under expectations.

Now it’s this second point I am wondering about. I understand much of Amazon sales would be hit with tariffs but I would have thought that the tariffs also meant that users of Temu, Shein, AliExpress have all moved back to Amazon and are now hoping to avoid tariffs (at least on some purchases) via Amazon.

So I’m wondering could this traffic shift to Amazon actually offset any negative impacts from tariffs, even possibly resulting in an unexpected upside from returning customers?
The tariffs on Amazon’s Temu level products are the same as Temu’s Temu level products so I don’t understand a thesis that tariffs create differentiation in their shared market segments. Amazon itself (not sure about the sellers on the platform) might be able to leverage overall lower shipping costs as they move goods in bulk, and they might have potentially already imported a large quantity of items when the tariffs were not being applied, while others mostly ship individual items from outside the US directly to buyers. Other than that, I'd assume Amazon would be affected by tariffs the same way. Yeah, exactly. Tariffs hit the same products the same way no matter who's selling them. Amazon isn't magically exempt from the same import fees Temu pays. Don't see how this creates any advantage for Amazon at all. This is the thing, once again feels like this hurts Temu, shein, AliExpress more than Amazon.

I feel like this kind of news basically shuts those sites down totally in the USA. Trump suspends exemption for low-value imports under $800…consumers are the ultimate losers here. All retailers are going to raise prices…by how much? We’re going to find out soon enough. It’s going to hurt, everyone needs to buckle up… The thinking is that, 100% of Temu’s products would have tariffs.

Maybe 50% or 70% or 30% of amazons products have tariffs depending on your shopping style.

Even if you are buying something you know originates from China and should have a tariff, you’re still more likely to buy on Amazon because the supplier might’ve brought a shipment onshore before the tariffs hit.

Seems like everyone would’ve just stopped using Temu etc in the USA post tariffs?

Edit: the other part I’ve ignored is also the uncertainty. So you could order today from Temu with a 45% tariff but by the time it arrives at customs the tariff might now be 150%.

1mdm2qx,2025-07-30,"I am confused - Why is this Call oddly priced?
I was looking to do a Covered Call on DUK for 130 for OCT25.   
When I saw the oddly situated ask at 135.. What am I missing. Even the 140 is higher?

  
[Link to image here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K969lzdd4DPADwGYXluq12pcRy4ZmKf-/view?usp=sharing)  



Options markets on individual stocks are very illiquid except for near dated options, around the current price and near major events. 

Notice there is no ask for the 140 call, and volume on all of these is extremely low. 

Basically, the 140 strike call is probably just a (why-not ask) from some HFT. If someone is willing to pay it, they will take it, but otherwise there is just very littler interest. What these tables show for out of the money calls can be deceptive. In addition to needing to look at the chart for recent trades, it's important to know that there can be significant interest in dark pools that simply don't show up on the table. For example, I recently sold hundreds of deep OTM Puts (Jan-16-2026) (not for DUK). According to the tables on Schwab, there was no open interest. FWIW, the premium turned out to be fairly close to what the tables said. Could have been a coincidence. The spread was large. Volume is not that bad on these. 130 oct17 call is $95, and 135 is $47.

RSI is at 57, so there’s some room to get a better price for the call 

Id set a limit order and forget it Option quotes can be funky with illiquid options. Quotes can be stale (the option may have last traded earlier in the day and with underlying price move, a higher strike call can appear to be less expensive than a lower strike call).  

Your time stamp says 4:10 PM.  At the close, traders cancel orders.  That can lead to very wide B-A spreads.  Your $140 call appears to be more expensive than the $135 because the B-A spread on the $135 is still tight, thereby artificially making the midpoint of the $140 call larger.

1mdly7r,2025-07-30,"Help Understanding Google Finance Lists
I have a Google Finance list setup to watch a stock, but I don't understand all the numbers in there.

For context I put in that I purchased X number of this stock on a certain date.  I figure the green number on the top left, 6.51% , is the total return for this stock since purchase.  And the green number on the right, Total Gain 5.67%, is the return for the total portfolio list.  But this is a single stock, single purchase portfolio.  I don't understand why the numbers are close but not identical. What am I missing?

Forgot to mention, the top left number changes with the display range, which makes sense.  But if I put it out to YTD, which covers the point I purchased the stock, the numbers are even more off between the chart and the portfolio number. 

[https://imgur.com/a/TUUSCK7](https://imgur.com/a/TUUSCK7)
If you bought the stock at a different price than the closing price, your value is still the same, but your gains would be different. Good call,  because I manually specified the purchase price. I played around with it and i believe the chart shows the portfolio *value*, while the Portfolio highlights shows the actual *gains*. It's basically a quote chart, multiplied by how many shares you have. Correct, which is why I don't understand why it's not the same. I didn't know if I didn't have something set up correctly or I wasn't understanding how it was displaying the numbers. I'm starting to think that it may just be an oddity in the way the way Google shows the return based on the time filter of the chart. It must not report back to my purchase date exactly. 

For example the purchase date was in May. If I do year-to-date for the range my portfolio it shows a return of 3.72% on the chart.  The actual return is 5.67% over that timeframe.

I can only link to a 5 year chart but it goes back further. 

I would also recommend going 100% VOO but if you are willing to take a risk, you could do worse, though I wouldn't touch OKLO in your circumstance. Way too speculative and hard to predict that market, even though it's memeing now. That makes sense. Don’t try to understand my logic, I’m new to this so probably just a rookie mistake on my end lol. Do you have any recommendations on how I should have my portfolio? Thank you for the advice! Just buy VOO. Unless you really really really really know what you're looking for, and I'm talking better than Warren Buffett, don't try to buy individual stocks. 

Go watch Common Sense Investing and Plain Bagel videos for a few years to start figuring stuff out. Just buy low fee index funds. 

I would dump it all into VOO with some minimal exposure to hedges. Instead of concentrating into specific stocks you can just leverage up the underlying index with something like TQQQ. You keep the diversification but now take on extra beta due to leverage.

Diversify a little bit with gold and ZROZ but if you have a small account you don’t really need to worry about it too much. You don’t reccomend buying nvidia or other tech stocks outside of VOO? I’m willing to take a risk but I want to make wise choices as well. Should I sell my VIG? Nvidia is 7% of VOO. As is Microsoft. 

Google is 2%. You've already got a lot of those by buying VOO. The point of something like VOO is cheap diversification, which you then undo by doubling down on expensive stocks.

I make around 300-400 a week and am looking to set myself up for the future. I’m trying not to take many high risk positions. Should I hold everything for now and keep investing in the same stocks? Liquidate some less high performing stocks and keep the cash? Divert to some other stocks because my outlook isn’t great? Any and all suggestions are great as I am not super well versed in this field and am trying to build wealth for the future the right way. 
Just so you know, NDAQ is just the actual exchange. It doesn’t track the nasdaq composite. Need QQQ instead if that’s what you’re trying to do NDAQ is a single company. It's the company that does the NASDAQ 100 (which qqq essentially tries to mimic). 
Qqq is an ETF with 100 companies 
NDAQ is one company Cool. 19 years old! Wish I knew earlier and was like you.

I'd probably start off with a good company and not worry too much so I can sleep.

May I introduce TSMC (Taiwan Semi Conductor) for you to consider. It makes chips for many AI focused companies and their orders are packed for the next couple years.

I am not sure who will win the AI race but I am very confident TSMC is making the chip for the winner.

Best of luck. Cheers. A small suggestion, at least make sure to know *what you're buying* before you start. Throwing money blindly at the market is a sure way to lose it all. It doesn't even take 5 seconds of googling to know the difference between Nasdaq the company and Nasdaq the index. If I were you, I'd just put the money into qqqm or spy/voo. Maybe 90% of it.  And 10% on companies you feel strongly in after doing research. Market goes up, market goes down, market goes up again. You are doing your future self a HUGE service by investing as young as you are.

1mcuu9h,2025-07-30,"How long did it take you to have confidence in your investment decisions?
So I (35M) just started playing around with trading stocks last week (I have absolutely zero experience whatsoever), and am unsure what I should expect the learning curve to be like?  I'm curious, from the community, roughly how long did it take  you to get the hang of things? For example, should I give up if I can't break even in 6 months? a year? (should I even be thinking about that?) Should I avoid stocks and stick to index/ETFs until I have more capital? So far, I've lost about 3% of my account (its a small 5k account, but does constitute most of my savings lol), and I'm not sure how disappointed/forgiving of myself I should be lol

In a related question (if anyone feels like sharing), I wonder what peoples' general thoughts are about learning this stuff alone, online, from random google searches / social media, vs from coursework, friends, professionals / mentors? I feel a bit rudderless right now doing things on my own tbh, and I wonder what guidance is most practical/efficient. Thanks.
Yes, you should stop trading and stick to broad index funds It only took me a few months to become confident that my decisions are shit. Don't trade stocks with money you aren't ready to lose. 

If you're scared of losing, just buy and hold for 40 years and 85% of the time, you'll win by doing nothing. 

For most people, the sheer amount of time and effort they spent into researching investing, if they put the same effort into say personal relationships or their career or dating, they'll be significantly happier than whatever 2% alpha they generate. You should probably start with index ETFs as a solid base, and if you want, give yourself a *small* amount of money to play around with every paycheck. But honestly, the broad research says investing regularly in (and staying invested in) index funds is the best path to building wealth.

Don't be trading in and out every day – that's gambling, not investing. 

Start reading the news (and read broadly) to form your own opinions about what's happening in the world and how that impacts the markets. And there is no real exact timeframe when you'll feel like you've got it all figured out – best to stay humble and remember you're continuing to learn throughout. You could ride a bull market for years only to realize you weren't ready for the first bear market you encounter! It isnt worth it, because you bring no information thats different from the market. You cant ""train to be a trader"". Vast majority fail, and those who do are niche super smart algo quants.

If you need to catch up to some future spending goal, then unfortunately your only way to dial up compensated risk past 100% is leverage, which comes with costs and danger for an emotional person. For example, instead of being 100% VT, you may need to be like 45% SPUU (2x SPY) / 55% ex-US, for 145% equity exposure, something akin to that.

Or utilize short box spreads to buy more stable leveraged instruments like RSSB (100/100 VT/IEF) but 1.5x exposure for 300% exposures to VT and IEF. I had confidence when I traded a single stock over and over for 18 months until I had made enough for the down payment on my first house. After buying the house, I started again and rode that stock all the way down until the company went bankrupt. Now I put everything in VOO and commercial real estate. keep your 5k as your active portfolio and invest the rest into index funds. If you are a good investor, you should be able to grow you 5k account higher and higher without continuing to contribute to it. If it goes to zero, you should stop. Been a market participant for 24+ years. Been a professional manager for five years. I sleep like a baby but I trust the odds and try to not make decisions myself.

I like to understand what is going on BUT I trust the odds regardless. Time Traveler: ""I want you to remember this word, okay? It's kind of like a code word: Yahoo. Can you remember that?"" - ""Frequency"" (2000).

1mcqhal,2025-07-29,"Premise: AI is not a bubble, it's a binary event
The binary event is whether the hundreds of billions or even trillions invested in AI either A) provides a good roic or B) does not provide a good roic.

Companies like meta have been investing massively in AI.  Companies like Nvidia have benefited massively from the capex from companies like meta.

So the premise follows that if meta has been making poor investments they will be punished when it's discovered.  And the discovery that investment into AI offers poor roic means Nvidia will see massive reductions in revenue and margins.

Companies focused on electrification, data center build out, etc have also seen growth and multiple expansion from the AI build out.  That is to say the ramifications of the AI capex spend is far reaching and has large effect on the current earnings and projected growth in the markets beyond Nvidia and meta.

And this premise goes both ways, if hundreds of billions or even trillions invested provides a good roic growth will be massive.  If meta gets a 10% roic on $500B it would add $50B to operating income, nearly doubling their current!

And thus it acts like a binary event.  Thumbs down it could take the market years to achieve the same earnings as today, potentially a lost decade.  Thumbs up and we'll be talking about how cheap these $1-4T valuations were.

Curious on people's thoughts on the matter if they have any.
AI is not binary because AI is not a single investable asset. It's a bubble, bro. It's just like the internet stocks. Internet wasn't a binary event. And even if it were, it would have varying positive and negative ROIs depending on the business use case > So the premise follows that if meta has been making poor investments they will be punished when it's discovered. And the discovery that investment into AI offers poor roic means Nvidia will see massive reductions in revenue and margins.

That sounds a lot like something you could say about any bubble before it bursts. Every bubble happened because the people involved thought there was huge upside and subsequently turned out to have been overly optimistic.

The only difference I see with your analysis is you’re labeling “we don’t know if this time is a bubble or not” as a “binary event”, but that’s just because we live in the present and see past bubbles from the perspective of knowing how they turned out. Isn’t that just a bubble??? Idiot It's a bubble....probably the biggest one ever It's almost exactly like the Dot Com bubble. 

We have a lot of company just throwing ""AI"" on their name without doing anything with AI (or barely doing anything with AI), had a ton of hype around AI, and now we'll get to the weeding out event as more and more investors start asking to see returns on the staggering amount of money companies are paying for AI.

We do have an unhealthy tech space that is much more concentrated than in the Dot Com era, so I would expect that the sorting probably just kicks out a ton of low-lying companies that are just fixing ""AI"" into their titles and keep the massive companies that can actually spend money on this stuff.

But it will be profitable. At the very least, once it can start really doing jobs, I expect companies like Google, Meta, etc, to rent out their AI to companies and make a lot of cash off it. I wish this was chatgpt because at least then it wouldn’t suggest ROIC is a binary. It’s like saying numbers are binary since there are negative and positive ones. Like $1M isn’t better than $50, because they are both positive and not -$1.

Even so, a binary event would allow for a bubble. 

Poorly invested funds in a frenzy is a bubble. The underlying concept can be absolutely sound and have it be a bubble. Like the dotcom bubble. Internet was for real. Companies that added .com to their name because they created a website, and then saw a huge investment are bubbles. Amazon was not. 

Same happened with crypto where some companies added coin or blockchain or crypto to their name and suddenly they rocket off to space. 

Same with AI, plenty of bullshit companies that buy an Anguilla domain and will get investment. A new innovation or technology does not need to be an either/or proposition. Bubble or binary. It is expected that as a new technology appears to be emerging there is a race to create, adopt and integrate. It may or may not work out. Without the investment it won’t be known. There will be winners and losers regardless. There may also be a new dawning of technology. I do understand that there is also the temptation “not to be left behind” so businesses feel obliged to be seen to be pushing the boundaries to compete or stay relevant. This may indeed be wasted capital. Then again the law of unintended consequences applies and also shakes up the old way of doing things to stimulate further assessment or innovation. Will it work? Who knows. Ai certainly is having an impact. The end result will evolve in time. For right now lots of companies are making huge gains that may not be sustainable after the dust has settled. As always each investment should be considered on its own merits. At it's peak the nasdaq 100 was over 200 PE during the dot com boom.

But if you're very good already, Ai is an amazing time saver. Allow me to illustrate.

I just tore apart Southern Company's investment thesis that Hyperscale Datacenters are driving growth of revenue that justifies 40 year-high multiples.

I'm short SO thinking this isn't true. I was able to grab statistics on datacenters existing, building and planned, in the entire territories of Southern Company. Divide their divisions by power and by natural gas, sort which data centers relied on their own natgas generators (because SO's nat gas provider is not an power plant operator in that way...a data center would have to consume their own nat gas).

I was able to get stats on new MW capacity per subsidiary, and get a percentage of how much of that expansion is Hyperscalers.

For instance Georgia Power's territory is only expanding its MW capacity for hyperscalers by 5%.

And Georgia Power's territory is the LARGEST growth of Hyperscalers into 2027. So 5% growth over 2 more years doesn't seem an amazing reason for 40 year-high multiples.

I think the multiples are related to fear and people are crowding the safe trade for the same reason I'm shorting the SPY and oil.

  
But I also short SO because I understand THEIR business and understand it's overpriced, and that ""safe havens"" don't exist. In a market crash, SO will go in the toilet with everything else.

But I was able to pull a ton of information, cross reference it, and source it with Ai. An amazing tool if you know how to use it and know how to avoid all its problems.
In just minutes you can falsely confirm all of your assumptions and biases! How useful!


As a bonus, you'll even be told how sharp and insightful you are 🙃 Nice try, ChatGPT.

It’s the current fad, sure, and many other services sprung up to deal with that. However, all the big websites are already using cloudflare, and Cloudflare upsell is how they run their business. Which brings me to the second point; how cloudflare runs their business.


As I mentioned Cloudflare has a free tier that’s insanely generous. Their paid plan is also ridiculously cheap. It’s a no-brainer for any business to get a couple of niceties but it’s also clearly a loss leader. They make all their money analyzing those users usage patterns and calling up those companies to upsell them on other various (often significantly more expensive) services cloudflare offers. They go through cycles of firing all their sales teams, working on products, then hiring a sales team to sell them to their biggest clients, rinse and repeat. I can easily imagine the amount of calls and contracts they can very easily close with a “Just click that button and you’ll block (or get paid by) AI bots”

The ugly part is their financials. They are not a young company (15 years old), but they have also never turned a profit. They have 50% their revenue YoY 18-22, though slowed down to 34% and 28% for 2023-2024. All of their cash flow is diluted by their employees and CEO stock options. 

I was watching it on IPO back in 2019 and remember thinking I’ll wait until they turn a profit. Then I decided to get into 10k in Jan of 2021 ($72 cost basis) thinking I’ll just buy it and forget it. 4 years later and still no profits. I’m up significantly of course. I wanna think that this has no way to go but up in 10 or 20 years. But I keep reminding myself that the company is already 15 years old. I’m waiting for the earnings call this week. Expecting (hoping for?) a significant revenue jump, but not expecting profits sadly. 


My biggest worry is not fully knowing how big that moat I mentioned is. It’s not rocket science to replicate, so not Nvidia, TSMC, ASML type moat. It’s more about the execution and logistics. Microsoft, Amazon, Google cloud drop a Cloudflare competitor yesterday. In fact they all have various “close enough” offerings that are just insanely expensive because they don’t operate anywhere near the efficiency of Cloudflare in that domain. 
Cloudflare is a great company, but I don't think it is a great stock. I like the company, but I would wait them becoming profitable.

Promise of edge computing hasn't really materialized, local computing is cheaper, colocated computing performs better.

Cloudflare cannot grow margins with just CDN and network services, so they need this edge computing, but I don't see it happening in large scale. Been holding for a few years and very happy about that. Wouldn’t add at these levels, but that’s as much to do with the general market as $NET. I haven’t researched them…in your opinion, why haven’t they been profitable in 15 yrs? Personally I think they are shaping up to explode higher in the next few years and am buying more. I’m a software dev and their products are amazing. Investors aren’t technical though so don’t really understand them but us devs sure do. I think I’m arriving at the same conclusion It doesn’t really matter how awesome the company is from a technical prospective when it comes to investing. As a consumer or a user, I love companies that waste their investors money to subsidize my stuff. Burn it all until you go bankrupt and I’ll just move to another company. As an investor though, I avoid those companies. Well it does matter because the technical underpinnings are what makes the products great. You don't understand Cloudflare's products so yeah, don't invest in it. Cloudflare isn't burning investor cash, they haven't raised anything since the IPO. How do you think they can post losses every quarter and still keep going? How do you think public companies raise funds exactly? They doubled their debt and the number of outstanding shares since 2021. That’s how they raise funds. They take on debt and issue shares. If CloudFlare needs $100M, they can print ($100M/current share price), and now they have raised $100M. Going from 146 million shares to 341 million shares at ~$80 a share that’s is raising 15B since their IPO through their stocks, i.e investor money. They have also doubled their debt. You don’t understand how business works, why invest? It’s just gambling at a certain point.

I have over 10k in my bank account just sitting there and feel like it’s time to start investing my money. I’ve looked into SPYs and other stocks like nvidia and Tesla (tech) and want to know what would be the best plan of action for someone like me. Average in on my price and buy certain amounts?

I’m sorry if this ain’t allowed just feel like I’m just losing time , I know I’m not going to become a billionaire over night but want to get things rolling. 
If you don't know anything about accounting, forget about buying individual stocks and focus on ETFs if you're looking to invest your savings, it's good to start with a solid plan. consider diversifying your investments to spread the risk. stocks, bonds, and even some real estate can be good options depending on your risk tolerance. also, keeping an eye on market sentiment can help inform your decisions. i built a tool called the Trump Market Index that tracks how Trump's statements affect market feelings. it might give you some insights as you decide where to put your money. just remember to do your research and maybe consult a financial advisor too. good luck! If it's part of QQQ and doesn't outperform it (eg. Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple) then just buy QQQ instead.

If it outperforms QQQ even if it's a component of it then it may be worth buying some shares (eg. Nvidia).

I'd say keep 40-60% of your portfolio in QQQ. Pick other ETFs and stocks for the rest. If it isn't outperforming QQQ then you better get something good in return from it, for example international diversification like EWN and DXJ.",2,0.75,4,0,NiteZTV,investing,['SPY'],plans investment money savings 10k bank account sitting feel like time start investing money ive looked spys stocks like nvidia tesla tech want know would best plan action someone like average price buy certain amounts also percentages invested companies like nvidia tesla apple invested spys qqq im sorry aint allowed feel like im losing time know im going become billionaire night want get things rolling dont know anything accounting forget buying individual stocks focus etfs youre looking invest savings good start solid plan consider diversifying investments spread risk stocks bonds even real estate good options depending risk tolerance also keeping eye market sentiment help inform decisions built tool called trump market index tracks trumps statements affect market feelings might give insights decide put money remember research maybe consult financial advisor good luck part qqq doesnt outperform eg microsoft amazon google apple buy qqq instead outperforms qqq even component may worth buying shares eg nvidia id say keep 4060 portfolio qqq pick etfs stocks rest isnt outperforming qqq better get something good return example international diversification like ewn dxj
1mbnqxx,2025-07-28,"Stoicism in Investing and the Importance of Portfolio Rebalancing
Let me preface by saying everything below is for folks investing in individual stocks/trying to generate excess return and learn about markets - if you’ve got a set it and forget it in index funds, that’s the right call for most people and this post isn’t for you.

Decided to post again on moves I’m making / have already made with my portfolio starting last week and extending for the next couple weeks through earnings. I’ve gotten some positive feedback / requests from newer/younger investors to provide my investment perspectives, so posting this in the hopes it helps some folks build a mental model for how to think about markets and hopefully not to get run over (avoiding big losses is as, if not more important than making big gains in investing). I studied Classics as well as Economics in college, and am always reminded when investing of the importance of stoicism (or in market parlance, mean reversion). Things are almost never as good or as dire as they seem and knowing this influences how I think about markets and how I look to profit through changes in sentiment and market cycles.

First, it’s critical to understand this isn’t a doomsday post but rather it’s important as individual investors to understand market sentiment. In the words of Warren Buffet “be fearful when others are greedy.” Not recommending anyone dump their whole portfolio tomorrow or enter a costly short position, but given we’ve had a 26% run up in 3 months (and much more in certain AI stocks), it’s time to start thinking about taking profits on positions that have materially run up and getting out of positions where valuations are insanely stretched (e.g, if you’re in PLTR, TSLA, Cloud Flare, etc). I’m personally exiting a number of positions and increasing my cash position to ~20-30%.

Positions I’m trimming/exiting:
AMD (out)
BTC (trimmed to <2% of portfolio)
Uber (waiting on earnings to trim/exit)
Draft Kings (waiting on earnings to trim)
CEG (out)
Google (still very long, holding core position but selling my long-dated options over the next few weeks as we hopefully bleed up toward $200 post a very strong earnings quarter - was my single biggest position).

Simple reasons behind this portfolio rebalancing:
1. Several AI stocks I invested in back/before April have run up materially and now are a larger portion of my overall portfolio (increasing portfolio volatility and risk). Have to recognize many of these stocks are priced at or near perfection at this point. It wouldn’t be shocking to see some air come out of this balloon in the short term, though I do believe in the longer term trend.
2. September historically is the worst performing month for the S&P, coupled with the fact that we’re starting to see peak euphoria tendencies (meme stock rallies, wild IPO rides, huge option bets by retail investors who have limited to no experience), spells for me time to reduce my risk.
3. The market right now is priced for the rosiest of scenarios. It seems to believe the economy will remain resilient AND rates will be cut ~2 times this year. I think one of these is likely to be true, but these scenarios are likely to be mutually exclusive, I.e, economy stays resilient and Powell keeps rates steady or economy starts to falter and we see the cuts, either way we surprise to the downside vs expectations. The market is also heavily weighted to the AI trade and is now above 30x earnings (average is closer to 22x the past 30 years)
4. I think the impacts of tariffs haven’t played out in the economic data yet (there’s a lag on these policies as they’re enacted, enforced, and inventory clears) and wouldn’t shock me to see some prints in the fall that start to rattle markets (given where we’re at now from a historical P/E perspective it won’t take much). I don’t think it’s Aug 1 that’ll send us but some higher CPI / lower consumer spending/confidence prints in the early fall that spell weakening economy or rate cuts being off the table.

This is all to say, at a market level, we’ve hit euphoria and I believe the balance of risk is now skewed to the down side. As a long-term investor, I’m always long the market but to different degrees, but for all these reasons, I’m trimming my nosebleed valuation stocks, adding to those with more reasonable valuations, and building a cash position. If we get a 5-10%+ dip (which I think is reasonable given the markets sensitivity to a 50 bps change in rate expectations), I’ll start layering into select positions again. As always, these are my views, not investment advice. Good luck out there!

One way or other at the end of the day this is still a  justification in trying to time the market.  
As per Buffet and Munger ideally you want to buy stocks to hold forever.  
But of course we all need money to spend so your point of cashing out on a run up is good , IF you need the money.  
If you are going to turn around and invest again then it’s timing again.  
Historical data says people are worse off who stay on the sidelines.  
Above is for well researched stocks and ones you believe in the long term. Have you looked at Berkshires holdings? They’ve doubled their cash position in the past year and have been selling down their financials positions in BofA, Citi, Cap One, and others precisely because multiples are running so hot in the financials sector.  If you’re going to just buy and hold an index fund, fine, but if you’re playing individual equities with concentrated positions and trying to generate alpha (like Buffett) you need to have a sense for when to rotate out when the fundamentals no longer justify the price, and the move is to cash while you look for new investment opps I could be wrong but what you're describing is a change in strategy, or more negatively, panicking. From what I understand, rebalancing means trying to return to your original strategy, because the waitings in your account have gotten out of whack. 

But if you're wanting to take investments off the table to have cash, and just sit on it, you're just getting nervous. Learn to read historical performance page, compare to benchmark. You’re likely just justifying panic selling with “rebalancing”. Best of luck. I think you're right in your thinking, however maybe lean towards taking some profits(trim) on most stocks you believe are going into oversold territory, unless something changes in your theiesis of a particular company, at which point you may want to sell all your holdings. This way you still have holdings in companies that continue to rise, and you protect major losses by taking profits. I never said buy and hold index fund. I believe in holding good stocks like Amazon for 30 years to get great returns, I have done it my self. You don’t get that return by trying to time the market. Not really, cash is an asset and at current rates yields over 4%. I think it’s healthy to maintain some level of cash (5-10%) and have been fully invested since April so in many ways, it’s restoring that position and  going a bit overweighting. As I stated I’m also looking for opportunities to redeploy into more reasonably priced stocks but those have been fewer and further between. Trimming massive winners over a 3 month rally is not panicking its prudent risk management. I should specify this is for people want to actively manage their portfolio and think about markets. If you’ve got a set it and forget it strategy, god bless I think that’s appropriate for most people.",0,0.5,7,0,InternationalTop4495,investing,"['TSLA', 'GOOGL']",stoicism investing importance

1max2ws,2025-07-27,"Investing in Magnificent 10 or so?
A lot has been written that the magnificent 7 are the source of most of th4e SP500 gains, so I was wondering if there was an ETF that invests in just those, and - of course - there is: $MAGS.

Then I looked at the hldings, and - of course - as expected: https://i.imgur.com/LPVeJyG.png

And then I thought: what if I were to tweak it:

* remove problem children like $TSLA and and $AAPL for instance
* expand it to include $AVGO, $TSM, $JPM, $V https://i.imgur.com/hu1ypBh.png 

It could be easily implemented with Fidelity's Basket Portfolio.

Is anyone else doing something similar? What are your ins/outs? How is it working for you?
Why stop there? 

I think it's a great idea but maybe expand it out to maybe magnificent 500 IShares has their market-cap TOPT (top 20 S&P stocks) or QTOP (top 30 QQQ stocks) for 0.2% ER.  

They also have a longer run OEF US S&P 100 (the top 100 US stocks) which has good long term # again for 0.2%. Go to r/dividends people do it all the time.  They just buy them and hold them.  With index fund you don't just get the good.  You also get bad or stagnant companies. So index funds have gains and dividends.  So by picking a limited number of good socks you can get better grow or dividends or both.  And if you hold long enough you could see significant gains Not a bad suggestion, and it could go 2 ways:

1. The Magnificent of the SP500
2. The top Magnificent 500 companies

Too bad that Fidelity Basket's limit is 30 securities. Quite interesting, thank you.

> QEF US S&P 100

I believe it's OEF (O, not Q). I already have $PLTR in a separate allocation of my portfolio.

Interestingly enough, it's at #21 by market cap; so it could make the Magnificent 20. I don't understand why that's a problem. VTSAX or FIAX (I think that's the ticket) both give you s&p 500 exposure. 🫡 Pltr",3,0.61,9,0,G4M35,investing,"['AAPL', 'TSLA', 'JPM']",investing magnificent 10 lot written magnificent 7 source th4e sp500 gains wondering etf invests course mags looked hldings course expected thought tweak remove problem children like tsla aapl instance expand include avgo tsm jpm v could easily implemented fidelitys basket portfolio anyone else something similar insouts working stop think great idea maybe expand maybe magnificent 500 ishares marketcap topt top 20 sp stocks qtop top 30 qqq stocks 02 er also longer run oef us sp 100 top 100 us stocks good long term 02 go rdividends people time buy hold index fund dont get good also get bad stagnant companies index funds gains dividends picking limited number good socks get better grow dividends hold long enough could see significant gains bad suggestion could go 2 ways 1 magnificent sp500 2 top magnificent 500 companies bad fidelity baskets limit 30 securities quite interesting thank qef us sp 100 believe oef q already pltr separate allocation portfolio interestingly enough 21 market cap could make magnificent 20 dont understand thats problem vtsax fiax think thats ticket give sp 500 exposure pltr

Hey guys, 

Multiple questions here

I’ve been investing for a while now, mostly in safe stocks like GOOG, NVDA and AMZN for long term with moderate knowledge, mostly long term.

I’m looking to expand my knowledge so investing can be my sideline and maybe my main income in maybe 10 years. Would love to learn calls, short squeeze and research companies. I love to learn but I’m not much of a reader.

1- How do you guys do your DD mostly ? 

2- I know it’s pretty impossible to predict how a stock will go. But like how did you guys find out about PLTR at 15$, GRRR at 4$ or RKLB at 7$ ?

3- do you guys use AI in any way to help you trade ? If so which one and how ? 

4- which YouTube channel or podcast do you guys watch or listen to improve ? 

5- any tools or website to recommend me, free or not, to improve ?

Thanks a lot!! 
Schwab & ToS have good tools. Schwab aggregates a lot of reports too. 

AI just scrapes the internet, it's just going to spit out reddit opinions Those stocks aren't particularly safe, you're just performance chasing which is a guaranteed way to *underperform* over time. You're buying high... Better stick to ETFs if that's your knowledge level.


1. This is incredibly basic stuff. Read the sidebar, read some books or at worse look up some actual tutorials from educated professionals (not influencers) on YouTube. Start by reading the investors page for stocks and their financial documents.



2. Reddit is good, as is twitter. You'll see 1 good stock out of 100 000 pumped bad ones. You'll get fooled big time and lose your money so hard. You'll see bagholders pumping shit and the ones that might get big is *the ones you'll not invest in because they seem to be losers at the time of writing*. You'll litterary know what's good and winner soon bad, that's why they're cheap..



3. The current AI models litterary *can't do stock analysis*. They can't, thats not how they're programmed. What they can do is, at best, summarise said economical reports for you to make it easier to do DD. But asking ChatGPT for stock advice is like asking the local crackhead...


4. None. Anything you see is *old and dated* this any stock advice is useless. Theoretical knowledge and hard facts are okay but there's simply too many scam artists since no one checks credentials. Read a book, get smart.



5. Not really. Investing is litterary buying VOO and chill. Trading/individual stocks is a *full time job done by the world's best professionals* and your trying to beat them, you might as well start jogging and challenge Usaine Bolt. The odds are astronomical that you'll underperform. Your only reasonable chance at winning is *pure luck* and there's no guide to luck. If you want to learn there is no *quick way to succeed, just hard work*. A basic econ degree is at least 3 years if full time studies...good luck! This appears to be a DD submission.

I’m a 22 years old from Spain just starting to invest, I’d say around 350 USD per month, in order to create a good portfolio in the long term. This is how it’s looking right now. Any feedback you could share? Of course it’s not that diversified just yet, but I’m working toward that goal. Next month I’m planning to add Visa, Apple, and I’ll start adding AUM5 (Amundi S&P 500ETF) gradually along individual stocks to ballance risk a little bit. Also, let’s see how UNH’s EC goes.

Maybe some etf that tracks international market (like iusq for example) ? I would recommend DCA'ing into a low cost index fund that tracks the S&P 500 and not bother with individual stocks right now (You're planing to buy Apple which is already pretty high weighted in the Amundi S&P500 ETF). Spend some of your time reading and understanding some fundamentals about investing.


That way you avoid costly mistakes early on (you're young so every dollar you lose from an early investing mistake wont compound for you in the future). 


Over time you can allocate about 10-20% of your portfolio into special situations where you have relative high conviction that they will work out (convicition that you'll gain by understanding the fundamentals). 


Just my 2 cents. Consider adding some international stocks for more diversification in your portfolio. Thanks!

1m9l0jj,2025-07-26,"Best stocks for my Roth IRA ?
Hi everyone. So I’m 18 and I have around 17.2k in the stock market from free GE, Apple and more stock. I have most of it in my utma account. I want to put around 1k a year in my Roth IRA to start. I already have Nvidia, Pfizer, ford, Nike, Chipotle, and other big brand name stocks. I’m up money in every stock I have. I recently bought NVtS and did an order for CSCo Can anyone give me recommendations on stocks to get out of these. I still have about 360 dollars I want to put in my Roth IRA until 2026. I was thinking between MRVL ( Marvell technology inc ), VRT ( Vertiv holdings )., CWAN ( Clearwater analytics ), CFLT ( Confluent inc), SOFI ( sofi technologies ), PLTR, ( palantir ). Dow chemical, and especially considering ABT ( Abbott laboratories ). Do any of these stocks sound good to get and at what price should I look for. I’m intrigued by ABT due to the fact they keep increasing the dividends every year. If anyone out there would like to give feedback to me on these stocks I would greatly appreciate it. 
Please for all that is holy, absolutley, undoubtedly, get out of individual stocks, and shift towards ETFs. At 18 with a Roth, there is no need to play a short stock game. When time is on your side you should play what has paid, and that has ALWAYS been the US stock market. Find a fund that has a very low Net expense ratio, and start throwing everything u can into it. Search S&P 500 index fund.
Good luck. You are in an incredibly lucky position with this money so early. I hope you play it smart, and good luck! If you're having to ask if your stocks are a good pick then you don't know enough about them to invest in them. Picking single stocks is incredibly risky and requires a lot of research to do effectively. You basically need to believe a company is mispriced. In other words, you have to know something that the market doesn't, and when I say ""the market"" I mean analysts who get paid sickening amounts of money to do this research all day every day.

The other factor is conviction in your holdings. When you thoroughly know the companies you hold inside out, when they inevitably take a downturn at some point it becomes a lot easier to hold because you are aware of the fundamental value of the company, and short term price action doesn't change that. When you're aping into tickers based on vibes and YouTube gurus, a 30% downturn in a week might have you panicking and selling at the lows instead of buying more at a discount.

Stick to global trackers, or add some exposure to the Nasdaq via QQQ if you want exposure to tech in particular, then forget about it and keep contributing until you retire, unless you're willing to do some serious due diligence on the positions you have and their respective industries youre probably getting so many answers but please take some risk.  youre 18.  im not saying buy penny stocks but the best thing you can do is educate yourself and take some risks vs playing it safe. Low fee ETF and chill. Open a brokerage account if you want to have “play” money to risk about. Dont listen to the naysayers. While i agree majority of your holding should be in an etf, theres nothing wrong with dabbling in stock. My Roth IRA holds an SP500 fund with fidelity. I also held palantir for years when i made purchases between $7-$22 share.

I started a position in BRKB, technically a stock but its somewhat of an etf. Otherwise i prob wouldve gone with google or a REIT like prologis Can you or someone explain the idea of stocks vs ETF? If it’s safer to do ETFs why isn’t that the way it’s done all over? Just because some would argue that doesn’t mean it is sound investing advice for a Roth IRA. That's a good one. It tracks the nasdaq 100. It is a solid investment that targets the tech sector and provides you with enough diversity that all your eggs aren't in one basket. I don't see technology as a whole taking a backseat in any future where money matters.

Individual stocks are risky, but if you find a company with  a product that you really understand and believe will do well, don't be afraid to invest in it.  Now is a good time in your life to take small risks. Just make sure to balance those risks with holding some more diverse positions in case they don't pan out. Idk too many individual stocks become hard to balance and manage in the long run imo. I would stick with a couple and just put the rest in ETFs like VTI or VOO. With that said I would pick MSFT and NVDA. At 18 you shouldn’t care about dividends. You care about growth.

1m9ef9y,2025-07-25,"Saving for bigger home in the next 1-2 years need investing/allocation advice
As the title says wife and I have our starter home we bought in 2018. Low mortgage with okay rate. Life has changed in those 7 years we’ve added 2 children and would like to get into a bigger home that can be forever. Our current home can’t be added onto due to lot and dimension limitations. Ideally would like to keep this home rent it out and purchase a new home once we have enough saved. Currently have about 75k in hysa and another like 25k invested in VOO and NVDA. Also have 529 for the kids. How should I allocate the 75k to help grow the down payment savings? 
Easy answer is that houses won't become more affordable. Given a time frame of 1-2 years you should only invest in a HYSA or bonds. Anything with ETFs, stocks or particularly crypto means *you stand a good chance to lose between 30-100% of your money* within this time frame. Thank you for this response! I do have a small side business to generate extra money. I agree that the timeframe is short and the small gains  in the market probably don’t justify the risks. It’s 208k left. I hadn’t checked the app in a while lol. This is actually a really challenging question. Depends on risk tolerance. 

Options:
1. Hysa maintaining value 
2. You think market is overvalued buy gold and reits
3. You look for undervalued stocks
4. You vti or mgk and chill
5. Go bitcoin crazy
6. You start a small business 
7. You buy a small business 
8. You get into options or futures
9. You flip something you know how to sell
10. Add side gig

What is your risk level? Taking out money in 2 years usually suggests that you should just hysa and add to it. Yeah I mean that’s what I’ve been doing but then there’s part of me that feels like I’m missing out on earning potential especially if our timeline becomes a bit ambiguous as we don’t really know when houses will become more affordable. But yeah I’m pretty much with you. No lies detected. We have a lot of equity in our home and it has doubled in value. I think I’m just making things more difficult with this aggressive plan to try to keep our current property as a rental since our mortgage is so low with can net around $800 based on the going rent in our area. Without this rental piece we would be good to buy tomorrow. But I’m thinking about wealth down the line. Most likely yes, as this wouldn’t derail my life. We are comfortable as is. The new home is a want not a need. So I do think if we lost we would simply be able to wait it out longer to come back. I think the question is more so the degree of risk. I would prefer to park more money somewhere that minimizes risk, understanding that growth is limited. But I’m just looking to outperform the hysa which is around 3.5%.

1m9b41j,2025-07-25,"should i convert single stocks into qqq?
looking over old portfolio stuff. hadn't glanced at it in a spell. saw there was a little vz (less than 100 shares) and tsla (less than 50)

vz operates on lots of debt in spite of a decent dividend. TSLA isn't the company i thought it was. interested in getting out. 

thoughts on selling and turning it into QQQ? thank you


Go for it.

Just remember to save some of it for long term capital gains tax. I got out of my Tesla & VZ like 2 months ago, rolled  it over to my VGT & FSELX ETF's. I have a bunch of  QQQ I can't imagine getting out of anytime soon. I say do it! VZ if the dividend isn't compelling you to keep it, go ahead and sell.  I had a lot of VZ at one time but the div eventually wasn't enough to keep me in it.

TLSA who knows, if you're not underwater on it, I'd possibly look at that as a lottery ticket.  Depends on what the size of your total portoflio is.  If TSLA's like 2% or less I'd at least think about keeping it unless you really hate it. Why QQQ?  Why do you think the top 100 companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange are currently undervalued? Thank you for taking a moment to respond. 

The consideration to get rid of vz is based on the stock really not doing anything for years, and that they operate under massive debt, and third it's a single stock.

my understanding, ist single stocks are often not the way to go for people trying to play it safer. I passively agreed to vz under the advisement of a professional a while ago. 

TSLA I thought had some good ideas a few years ago (pre COVID) but this year has really made me reconsider all that. 

QQQ just seems a safer, long term etf that may not have the giant swings but is a collection of companies that will do well over the next two decades.

I would like advice on how to approach investing for someone around my age group (38 years old). I currently have some money set aside in my checking and also in my 401K and I have been anxious to make recurring income using monthly options ETFs like QQQI, SPYI, GPIQ and GPIX. However, it seems like in that decision I also sacrifice growth for income and gives a lot of headache with taxes. My career in Healthcare Consulting is pretty stable (so far lol) and I want to take advantage and Invest the right way in order to balance both reoccurring income and money appreciation. 

In your opinion, what is the best approach to balance both growth but also recurring income that DRIPs over time? Would love to see examples of portfolio breakdowns. 

Have you ever experienced a similar scenario and what did you decide to do? 
Thanks a lot! Very helpful! You can do this but you need to have a budget for the risky moves you make. Majority of your money should be invested in multiple areas. If you don't have time or mentality for growth/value investing then get someone to help you as it was mentioned. Some people just vti and chill. If you enjoy researching companies and building yourself then that is a different conversation. Find a hire a trusted pro. You shouldn’t be managing money, this is no insult. You’re too young to be focused on income. 

Investing right is buying VOO on an automatic weekly basis and only selling when you have something urgent to pay for. 

But you sound like you have the wrong temperament. You will panic sell. Again, no insult here. But you need help. Open a Fidelity account. Have several consultations with their advisors. You can start with what I told you though. Best of luck. If you’re going to do a robo advisor, just weekly buy VOO.

You want income, and you think VOO is boring? Goodness you don’t realize how little you know. Income strategies are the soccer mom mini van of investing brother. 

If you make good money, just find and hire a pro. Most suck, but if you find a good one, they make all the difference. Best of luck. I agree with VOO but it seems too slow and boring haha.

1muutca,2025-08-19,"Stock Picking : that was very hard today ...
Hi everyone,

  
Sorry for my english but i'm not english speaking. 

I was happy to see finally a drop of the market to refill or buy new stocks. I got a very simple way : i got a list of order with a price which is chosen according to technical analyse. So i chose a support as an order price. In main cases, the gap is between 10 and 20%. Sometime, it's very hard to be patient, because you see the stock get 10% in one week, the same next week , and you feel to lose a big opportunity you found. But at the end, you have to accept to have lost the opportunity as the stock got up before you find it. And the only way, it's to hope the stock will drop ""hard"".

And today, that was my lucky day ... euh for 1 hours. I don't monitor stockmarket like some people (futur, index ...). So when i got some notification from my broker announcing me my order past, i was ""happy"". But when i get on my computer, I see my portfolio in blood. Energy Fuel got to -20% and now I got loss on this stock while i got +25% profit some days ago ... We can talk about the same for Credo tech, Astera Labs, Celestica, everything is very red. Yes, i guess i chose the wrong price for my order, 10/20% gap is not enough lol

I don't know why this drop today ... nothing happened today. Trump will bring ""peace"" in Ukraine, US economy is not bad. What is the main issue ? 

I've got some few cash to put in the market, but i don't know, I guess the drop is not finished ... 

In my european tax advantaged portfolio, alll the defense stock lost 8% today (hensoldt and renk) cause of the possible end of war. This day is a big hurt for me :(

  
What do you think ?
You call this a dip? I remember days when the Nasdaq was down 1500 points at a time day after day 1 tiny red after 3 months and bulls are crying 😂 i bought the dip , u cant really time it . chill ur ass - sentiment is crazy bullish [deleted] Not all dips are to be bought. Here people start charging as soon as it drops by 2% without wondering about anything. Almost everyone thinks it's like going to the store and finding an item on sale. Then perhaps, as often happens, if you scratch below the discount you realize that they had inflated the price. i bought many stocks today . Microsoft | Amazon | Alphabet | ASML | Uber | Novo Nordisk | Thermo Fisher | UnitedHealth | Visa | BYD | Xiaomi | Rolls-Royce | Pepsi | Waste Management | Deutsche Telekom If you come with offerings, they say the graybeards will tell of the times before time… Of 2008 and even 2000. Are you sure it's the dip today ? Fed will talk friday ... not sure we will get the word the market wants... First of all what makes you say the U.S. economy is not bad? Lmao.

I used to think that the motherfucker was just dumb, now I realize they are deliberately trying to crash the US economy. It still astounds me that we have a president who is literally breaking the law every day with this tariff nonsense.

NLMK is Novolipetsk Steel, located in Farrell Pennsylvania, near the Ohio border. The Indiana plant is in Portage, Indiana. 

NLMK Group is the largest steelmaker in Russia. It's owner is Vladimir Sergeyevich Lisin. 

Sergeyevich is an oligarch closely tied to Putin. He's known to finance Putin’s United Russia party and was included on the U.S. Treasury’s so-called “Putin’s List,” of elite Russians with close Kremlin ties. ""Lisin owns major industrial assets in Russia and abroad, with significant interests in steel and transportation, and his companies supply steel to the Russian military-industrial complex, linking him economically to the Russian state and its war efforts in Ukraine.""

1muhvr0,2025-08-19,"(08/19) Interesting Stocks Today - Softbank Takes Stake in INTC!
Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [Intel's Ceo Draws Support For Revival From Softbank Trump](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-19/intel-s-ceo-draws-support-for-revival-from-softbank-trump?srnd=homepage-americas)

[**INTC (Intel)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTC&p=d)\-SoftBank is buying stock equal to roughly 2% of Intel’s outstanding shares in a $2 billion investment, driving the stock up!! News hit AH yesterday, ultimately interested to see if INTC makes another run at the open and if we can sustain- we've made a massive 6% move already. Despite the bearish news of  US government potentially using CHIPS Act grants to buy equity in the company, SoftBank news seems purely bullish until we get more details. This hasn't moved other semis much (NVDA/AMD unaffected). Thank you Nana!!!

[**OPEN (Open Door)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OPEN&p=d)\-Carrie Wheeler resigned as chair and CEO and the board launched a search for her replacement. This has caused the stock to explode from $2.50 -> $4. Again, this has meme stock written all over it. Not too interested in any long-term plays, but interested in seeing if we can break $5 again. Currently short-biased.  Personally, I don't think this can make any kind of sustainable move because it's way too liquid to make any of those epic squeezes we've seen from other companies in the past- illiquidity is what drives the massive moves when people get squeezed.

""VK2735, helped patients lose up to 12.2% of their body weight. However, roughly 28% of patients dropped out of the trial in just three months, dampening hopes that the pill could compete with treatments from LLY/NVO."" Had an epic spike to the upside then sold off close to 35%-mainly looking for a bounce in this stock if we reach $25 again.

Cited ""unprecedented demand for AI compute infrastructure"". Interestingly enough, Sam Altman said yesterday that investors were ""overexcited about AI"".

Anyway, this stock has near doubled in the past 3 months and I'm interested to see if we can hold above $16. Hyperscalers are only viable if there's unrelenting demand and it seems that there isn't any reduction of demand (for now).

1mtxxew,2025-08-18,"$TSLA: Tesla Pivot Point, Declining Auto EV vs. Batteries, RoboTaxi & Robots
**TSLA $335.16**  
Shares Outstanding: 3.2 billion  
Market Capitalization: $1.1 trillion  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The company must be valued on a sum of the parts basis. I am excluding grid scale batteries, to keep this  
analysis simple. If you are bullish on Tesla EVs, then as much as $200 of the stock price could possibly be explained by this business segment.

Bullish View on Autos:  
**AUTOMOBILE BUSINESS: ""$600 billion market capitalization""** / \~$200 per share requires Tesla generating $60 billion in free cash flow per year by 2035

Bearish View of Autos:  
– $50 per share ($150 billion)  
– $100 per share ($300 billion)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Everything else, including RoboTaxi and Humanoid Robots is therefore worth $500 billion to $900 billion on a pre-revenue basis.

**Question:** How are you all thinking about the size of Tesla's emerging businesses?
Insanely overvalued. Where is your free cashflow of 60b coming from for the auto business? They made 146m in Q2 25. 3.6b in 24. And that was before the CEO tanked the brand and China flooded the market with state of the art EVs. Honestly, what does Tesla got left? The last surge/pump was due to Elon's involvement, a.k.a. potential corruption, with the most powerful entity in the world. Now that part is shattered and his image demolished the image of Tesla with his base, which is reflecting with sales around the globe, what is left with Tesla to use as an anchor to climb up?

RoboTaxi? Cybertruck was a dud. The competition has closed in and will continue to shore up from every angle. I've held on to this stock for over 10 years, and frankly, I'm not sure if the fanboys can push it over $450 any time soon. I can wait for another 10 years perhaps but there are more lucrative trophies out there than Tesla. Convince me other otherwise. Maybe Elon should make ev goal posts…at least those keep moving. Robotaxi is 5+ years behind Waymo which is doing over 250,000 paid passenger rides a week. 


Telsa just pulled their ""robotaxis"" from public preview after several recorded safety incidents in two weeks. 




""Robots"" is a joke. Tesla is well behind Figure and others. And it was abundantly clear that their ""robot"" was being controlled by a human with a remote. 


Musk is a scammer I don't think Tesla does $60 billion in FCF from Automobiles, but that is what is required to support a $600 billion valuation. Agree with you that Tesla is facing INTENSE competition. Meanwhile stock is up 1,46% today, another bad news, another rally. Too bad they suck at all those things Ah ok… I thought that was your estimate. I don‘t see the TSLA case. Even the bullish analysts say the robotaxis are a long shot. Like break-even well into the 2030ies. And then you still need to make profits to justify 1t$. I say we see 150$ before we see 450 again. There is already intense competition in humanoid robotics. I wouldn't even say Tesla has a lead. FigureAI, 1x, Apptronik, Agility Robotics and then you have Amazon robotics and Google's Gemini Robotics teams pushing hard on the research side. A lot of the startups  have heavy backing from Nvidia, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, etc. China has a ton of companies pushing humanoid robots hard as well.

The barrier to entry on a humanoid robots has become so low. Commodity robotics hardware paired with foundation ML models trained via simulation / world models. A much much lower barrier to entry than automobiles. You need a small fraction of the capital and there's so much development going on with Vision Language Action (VLA) models and tools for training via simulation. Google's Genie3 world model could fundamentally transform robotics development. Nvidia is also pushing to open source VLA models and simulation tools for training robots. They benefit by locking everyone into their edge compute platform.

Personally, I see this as a race to the bottom at maturity and not a winner take all market. Similar to how LLMs are becoming a race to the bottom.",35,0.72,25,0,meifx,stockmarket,"['TSLA', 'GME']",tsla tesla pivot point declining auto ev vs batteries robotaxi robots tsla 33516 shares outstanding 32 billion market capitalization 11 trillion ________________________________________ company must valued sum parts basis excluding grid scale batteries keep analysis simple bullish tesla evs much 200 stock price could possibly explained business segment bullish view autos automobile business 600 billion market capitalization 200 per share requires tesla generating 60 billion free cash flow per year 2035 bearish view autos 50 per share 150 billion 100 per share 300 billion ________________________________________ everything else including robotaxi humanoid robots therefore worth 500 billion 900 billion prerevenue basis question thinking size teslas emerging businesses insanely overvalued free cashflow 60b coming auto business made 146m q2 25 36b 24 ceo tanked brand china flooded market state art evs honestly tesla got left last surgepump due elons involvement aka potential corruption powerful entity world part shattered image demolished image tesla base reflecting sales around globe left tesla use anchor climb robotaxi cybertruck dud competition closed continue shore every angle ive held stock 10 years frankly im sure fanboys push 450 time soon wait another 10 years perhaps lucrative trophies tesla convince otherwise maybe elon make ev goal postsat least keep moving robotaxi 5 years behind waymo 250000 paid passenger rides week telsa pulled robotaxis public preview several recorded safety incidents two weeks robots joke tesla well behind figure others abundantly clear robot controlled human remote musk scammer dont think tesla 60 billion fcf automobiles required support 600 billion valuation agree tesla facing intense competition meanwhile stock 146 today another bad news another rally bad suck things ah ok thought estimate dont see tsla case even bullish analysts say robotaxis long shot like breakeven well 2030ies still need make profits justify 1t say see 150 see 450 already intense competition humanoid robotics wouldnt even say tesla lead figureai 1x apptronik agility robotics amazon robotics googles gemini robotics teams pushing hard research side lot startups heavy backing nvidia microsoft google amazon etc china ton companies pushing humanoid robots hard well barrier entry humanoid robots become low commodity robotics hardware paired foundation ml models trained via simulation world models much much lower barrier entry automobiles need small fraction capital theres much development going vision language action vla models tools training via simulation googles genie3 world model could fundamentally transform robotics development nvidia also pushing open source vla models simulation tools training robots benefit locking everyone edge compute platform personally see race bottom maturity winner take market similar llms becoming race bottom

First of all, I don't want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it visualized via closing prices from August 8 to August 15.

This week's key economical datas released like CPI, PPI, inflation expectations. The week started quiet, but PPI made a huge negative surprise.

📊 Here are the S&P 500's week-by-week results for the last 4 week,

July 18 close at 6,296.79 - July 25 close at 6,388.64 🟢 (1.46%)

August 8 close at 6,389.45 - August 15 close at 6,449.79 🟢 (0.94%)

🔸 Monday: The weekend and pre-market were quiet. In the semiconductor sector, $NVDA and $AMD will pay 15% of China Chip sales revenue to U.S. The stock market opened flat. In the session, Trump announced two important things about tariffs that are deadline with China was extended 90 days and gold will not be tariffed. The stock market closed slightly lower. 🔴

🔸 Tuesday: Before the session, CPI inflation was released and rose 0.2%. Core CPI inflation rose 0.3% month-over-month and there was expectation. However, CPI increased 2.7% year-over-year and expectation was 2.8%. As a result, the probability of rate cut rose over 90% in CME FedWatch Tool. The stock market opened higher. The S&P 500 jumped over 6,427 that is the all-time high value from July 31. Trump had continued to want to lower interest rate. The White House announced Trump and Putin will meet one-on-one on Friday. The S&P 500 closed above 6,400 for the first time ever. 🟢

🔸 Wednesday: Before the session, Scott Bessent said he expected Fed to begin rate cuts in September with 50 bps. Also, he wants that should be 150 or 175 bps lower now. The stock market opened higher. The probability of a September rate cut rose to 99.8% in CME FedWatch Tool. The stock market closed slightly higher. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: Today is PPI data day. Expectations were close to CPI, but it came in with a huge negative surprise. PPI rose 0.9% month-over-month and it is biggest monthly increase since June 2022. Core PPI rose as PPI and it is biggest monthly increase since March 2022. Core PPI rose 3.7% year-over-year. Sure, the stock market opened lower, but the stock market recovered losses in the final hour. Trump said I think Putin and Zelenskiy will make peace. The S&P 500 closed higher, but only by 0.02%. 🟢

The stock market opened higher. 20 companies of Dow 30 were positive. During the session, Michigan released inflation expectations and 1-year rose to 4.9% from 4.5%. The stock market lost opening earnings and closed lower. It broken 3-day winning streak. 🔴

Despite the negative datas, the rate cut hopes continue to support the indices. I had expected that we would not break above 6,247 level in August, but we closed higher so far. I will follow the 6,200 level for stop-loss point in my trading portfolio.

What do you think? What do you think? How was your week?

>Inflation expectations rose

>Rate cut hopes continued to support the market

These things are in cognitive dissonance And when there is no rate cut next month, the market will go up again because it expects another rate cut the next month! 9.9% up for the year!!! Still negative compared to the $ -10% Should be an interesting week Literally selling USD to most other currencies you would have beat the market I think if Powell hints he’s not liking the data and not to get your hopes up yet about a rate cut, (which I doubt he does tbh) then we should see this bull keep charging ahead for the time being. I think so. After the PPI inflation, I expected bigger sell-off, but the market did not matter that. It's completely focused to rate cut 😀 Last year closed at 5,881. It's nearly 9.7%. Nice. This week does not have much data, but Powell will speak on Friday.

1mrf246,2025-08-16,"Everyone’s still watching NVIDIA. Meanwhile, AMD is quietly building the architecture that will define the next decade.


The semi-conductor industry doesn’t move all at once. It pivots at first in engineering, then in market perception, and finally in valuation.

Right now, the pivot is happening at the silicon level.

NVIDIA’s AI dominance has been built on monolithic GPU designs - enormous dies packed with compute, stitched together by NVLink. H100 is the peak of that model.

But monolithic scaling is hitting its limits. Yields are fragile. Costs are exploding. Thermal ceilings are real.

The solution isn’t more of the same. It’s chiplets - modular silicon blocks, tightly integrated in package, with better yield, better economics and scalability.

That’s where AMD is already way ahead - it’s been leading the front on chiplets since 2019 with 6 years of production experience and market feedback.

MI300 is the pinnacle of its efforts so far.  Multiple chiplets: CPU, GPU, HBM, all unified in one advanced package.

It’s already running in hyperscalers and becoming the preferred GPU at Meta for inference - which will be driving the dominant compute cost for AI.

Meanwhile, Nvidia’s first real chiplet design (Blackwell) has received praise like it was the next messiah from Wall Street analysts who have no clue what a transistor looks like. In reality, Blackwell is Nvidia’s first foray into chiplets with a simple two die architecture connected by NVLink.

AMD has already solved many of the interconnect, latency, and thermal challenges of chiplet designs while Nvidia are just beginning to address - still resting on its fading laurels its single-GPU superiority.

What about CUDA and PyTorch??

Well, that “moat” is being etched away as well as AMD’s ROCm alternative is maturing and Triton becomes cross compatible with PyTorch.  AI software engineers will have no reason to complain about AMD in a few years.

No more mental laziness claiming Nvidia owns both the hardware and software stack.

If you’re hearing this for the first time, congrats you’re a year ahead of the crowd and hopefully can see why AMD’s runup is only getting started.

Repost bot A thing to note: Nvidia is still the leader and is not even close to losing the crown. Nvidia has tons of cash that they spend on growing and advancing in the sector. 

A thing to note here: The demand is so abnormal that neither Nvidia nor AMD can fill it AND it is still growing and expecting to grow rapidly in the future. 

My opinion? If you want to invest in the sector, both are great. Good. I have both So we should invest in Advanced Money Destroyer? The moat is only getting bigger. Have you tried writing SYCL or OpenCl by yourself? A pain in the ass.
Meanwhile, everyone's writing CUDA and if I need help I have a group chat with dedicated Nvidia engineers, how cool is that? 

And you got it the wrong way, AI is using shit loads of compute and if you're going Big, you might as well have all the components as close as possible. Why would you have your GPUs connected by cables when you can have them on the same board.
Big GPUs are the way to go. That's why Nvidia went chiplet, just to have 2 dies as close together as possible. And if it had been physically possible to just make the chip bigger, they would've done just that.

The only thing that can change the state of things is new hardware that makes inference 10x faster at 0.1x the cost. 
Oh, and NVIDIA already has chips with ARM and RISC V processors built into them. Dr. Su is a brilliant scientist and she has proven to be a savvy businessperson as well with strategic acquisitions of Xilinx and recently ZT. Her solutions focused mentality will serve AMD customers well.

Agree with you that NVIDIA cannot be the sole player, but in fairness, by defining the market with each new configuration, it’s the gaps that AMD will seek to exploit to earn their place in the market.

1mq8t73,2025-08-14,"Isn’t WULF highly undervalued?
Was looking at the news on the stock today and they inked 2 deals worth 3.7B with Fluidstack and two 5 year extension options that could mean $8.7B in revenue. Google looks to be providing $1.8B in exchange for 41 million warrants for an 8% stake. 

Given theres 391.93M shares outstanding, just the 3.7B value = 9.44/share. If it went all the way to the 8.7B value = 22.19/share. If Google felt 1.8B for an 8% stake made sense then this means a 22.5B value. If that materialized then 57.4/share. 

Given it did have a good run up already (8.05/share as of writing this post), how isn’t this a wildly undervalued stock based on these metrics at just 8/share or a 3.15B valuation? 
Ryan?! Didn't you sell that company? WUPHF.com !remindme 5 hours lol. So sell all now based on that one sentence. Sure thing. WULF got a 3.4x return on their investment in divesting from Nautilus. Which had leases expire in less than 2 years anyway. 

They fully own their Lake Mariner facility in upstate NY and their power generation costs will actually be cheaper than Nautilus when Talen’s lease gets renewed. It was a smart move for both companies IMO. The operating expenses just for their 25% share  of Nautilus is equivalent to about 4x the MWs from Lake Mariner. It was a no-brainer. This move overhauled their fleet of miners and paved the way for their capex for the initial buildout at the beginning of the year. They’re a better bitcoin miner now than they were before 2025. Their hashrate is up qoq for the last 2 years and up 53% yoy. Explained simply that puts them in the top ten for hashrates. This part of their business was heavily invested in this year all the while most of it was paid by the sale. 

Now that they’re opening up a new revenue stream with the HPC/AI data centers. With bitcoin mining (250MW), Core42 already online (72.5MW) and Fluidstack’s coming online EOY/2026 (250MW) they still plan to expand an additional 800-850MW between both NY facilities. So room for another 3x on contracts like they brought in this week. 

Arguing that they aren’t profitable with having billion dollars of capex on the table is idiotic. Good luck with that. This is one of the smartest plays on diversification that I see with any of the miners. The best thing I think they have going for them is the energy knowledge is well experience and in-house. As Beowulf E&D they’ve been doing power gen/infrastructure for the past 3 and 1/2 decades managing around 20 sites and projects. IMO this is the best mix in the market for exposure to AI datacenters, energy and it has the bonus of mining bitcoins just like SETI at home with the excess resources. Their pivot was timed well after this year’s halving. They’re set up perfectly for the move and their expertise is in power and it benefited from bitcoin rather than the other way around. The Google backstop is key. Bruh hahaha 45% of business in the Russell 2000 are not profitable.

1ml84x2,2025-08-08,"The timing release of gpt5 suggests to me Altman knows this Market is going to crash
I tagged this as fundamentals due diligence due to the fact that I have researched this 

Sam Altman released gpt5. I have used it quite a bit and I find it to be much better than previous models. However, the very first time I asked it something I actually knew it gave me the incorrect answer. I asked about the local housing supply and I even told them what websites to look at and they got it wrong by 40%

That makes me question just how much information they gave me. That wasn't correct that I didn't know factually before I asked. 

Hallucinations apparently have dropped from 33% to under 5% with gpt5 that is excellent! That is a great improvement 

However Sam Altman, I am sorry that is not PHD level 
Physicists like Edward Whitton and Neil Tyson degrees don't make make mathematic mistakes 5% of the time they make them Less than 1%. 

By releasing 
Gpt5 in this current economic environment where the CPI data could spark a sell-off next week, Altman knows the valuations have gotten far ahead themselves? And when asked this morning on squawk box when he was going to start seeing an roi he said I don't know. We're just going to keep building until we aren't making any more progress. So he is going to spend another trillion dollars to improve that 5% mistake rate to under 1% and that lasts 4 percent is going to be the hardest 4% they've ever scaled. 

Now how does this have to do with tying into the market? 
Well currently currently open AI is worth something like 300 billion but is valued at 500 billion in terms of market valuation. Meaning his employees can sell shares if they were eligible today knowing that there is going to be a pullback before they the company is actually worth half a trillion dollars 

This would allow the employees to walk away with a paycheck and then head over to meta or Microsoft or Google. Ees here's the catch. The employees can't sell their shares until January 2026 at the earliest ... So if Sam Altman is smart as smart as me and I'm sure he is. Lol. He is going to make sure that the valuation of his company is not worth it to his employees to walk away at that moment. Cuz a sell-off in shares from his employees and walking away could be disastrous for open AI 

However, if he has devalued the other companies in the market as well because of oversaturation or pushing them so fast so far that they fail or run into major hurdles the lure of going to other companies would not be that exciting. Meta will for sure face another antitrust lawsuit Altman just needs to wait that out 

Anyways that's just my take. I like to look at things in layers because I don't understand why he rolled out such a crappy version of gpt5. It would be like the iPhone rushing out a supercycle a iPhone that had chat GPT5 on it. But they aren't going to do that because that's not th this is not the peak moment for Apple to capitalize on the AI Revolution and people can finally see that Apple is going to capitalize on it

What would you do -

Bought when it was $8/9. At this point, my cost basis is 0 because I also made more by selling covered calls than I invested in PLTR stock. So, as I have nothing left to lose on PLTR out of pocket, I am trying to figure out whether and how to exit.

So....

If PLTR grows to become $1T from here, the gain from here would just be 100%.

The valuation is so rich, that continued growth in revenue will be required at much higher rate than what NVDA had during its bull run ( from $400 to $1T was done between 2022 to 2023). Some data pulled by chatgpt -

.

**And if 'AI' is the reason for PLTR's bull run, it seems highly valued compared to that of NVDA during same phase.**

At this point, it has started to make sense to book profit and reinvest in future dips. That's my reasoning based only on simple SP and growth numbers.

Any other longs contemplating this ? What's your theory if you have decided to exit/continue to hold at current SP ?

Also, if you are thinking to buy PLTR NOW, what's your theory and what are your realistic expectations?

not advice. dyor.

Edit - Update. I exited 90% and keeping 10% in PLTR. Also, have a **speculative small position** in PLTZ (inverse/short 2x PLTR), going to keep adding upto certain limit only and then hold. Will eat up some of my realized profit from PLTR, but it ""feels"" :) PLTZ can likely give 100%+ sometime in the future. Just a speculation. Not advice.  
Not gonna say this means you should or should not invest in PLTR, not gonna check your math.

Only gonna say that is GOOD to check out market caps when thinking about investing in something, particularly if you have hopes of 10×ing your investment.

1mjziz9,2025-08-07,"Trump is proving to be right and winning with tariffs ...
Today, even the most pessimistic analysts admit they were wrong about the tariff policy. For them, this policy was supposed to lead to a trade war, but the vassal-like behavior of other countries, particularly European ones, as well as Asian countries like Japan, South Korea, or Vietnam, has been the big surprise. Not only accepting such tariffs but also promising billions on the table was simply unimaginable. Not to mention that the absence of reciprocal measures makes American-made goods even easier to export. The first consequence is a relocation to the US to avoid US tariffs but also to make it a hub for exporting to other countries since they won’t face reciprocal tariffs.

Today, the market is strongly welcoming the start of the tariffs, with the Nasdaq potentially surpassing 1% today. An influx of 300 billion dollars is being reported.

Some will argue, 'Yes, but it’s the American consumer who pays.' Yes and no. It depends on supply and demand. If there’s a made-in-America alternative in the US market, then no, because if the imported good becomes more expensive due to tariffs, it will be eliminated from the market by consumers who will buy the American product. In cases where there’s no alternative, particularly for European goods, it’s mostly in B2B and branded products (where consumers seek a specific brand, not just any product). But given that there will likely be relocalization, this will be temporary.

In Europe, you only need to listen to companies to understand that the strategy is the same:

* Relocate
* Cut margins and expect poor results in the coming quarters
* Exit the US market because it’s impossible to compete.

China managed to outmaneuver Trump because almost everything it produces is practically impossible to find as made-in-America:

* Manufacturing of affordable consumer tech
* Affordable textile manufacturing
* Toy and other product manufacturing

These are impossible to relocate or produce as alternatives in the US at the same price. So, even with high tariffs and price increases, Americans will end up paying.

Today, we see all the big tech companies writing checks to please Trump. Apple is set to spend 600 billion to try manufacturing iPhones and iPads in the US... He even gave them a little golden trophy...
There's a lot of assumptions and extrapolations here. You can't judge macro economic shifts in a day. Takes time to play out, nobody actually knows what will happen with prices, imports and jobs. 


We might not even ever know if they fire the person doing the stats and putting in a yes man. Don’t we pay the tariffs? The consumers You did not explain, you tried to rationalize Trump's irrational argument. In some fantastical philosophical and misleading sense the consumer doesn't pay. In the literal real world, it's literally a tax the consumer pays. Those concessions are all a mirage. He's making the economy less competitive and taxing consumers to do it. That's the real situation. You've been blinded by someone saying they're winning and telling you other countries are paying. >Today, the market is strongly welcoming the start of the tariffs, with the Nasdaq potentially surpassing 1% today.

Markets act irrationally. Stop looking for fundamentals and logic in it.

>Some will argue, 'Yes, but it’s the American consumer who pays.' Yes and no.

It's the American consumer who pays. You really think companies are charities or something? Go ahead, connect the dots. Try and figure out how we get from ""company pays a tariff"" to American consumer pays more for stuff. It's not that hard to connect those dots.

>Apple is set to spend 600 billion to try manufacturing iPhones and iPads in the US.

Yes, Apple can most certainly manufacture all of their iPhones in the USA. Apple also knows that the consumer will not pay $2,500 to $3,500 for a silly phone.... And then the tariffs were postponed Check back in a few months. They are just taking effect 😆😆 You're wrong.  I work in a field that imports goods. I promise you *we* are footing the bill on the tariffs based on whatever day they happen to land, and we pass that directly to our end user. Nobody can plan properly because the tariff rate from our biggest suppliers changes on a seemingly daily basis and WE get taxed based on whenever the ship decides to land. 

Our vendors overseas? They’re fine. JD, is that you? 👀

The idea that tariffs are a surprise success ignores the long-term consequences for the average consumer. Sure, other countries might accept tariffs for now, but the reality is that the cost of goods will rise, and the US will still pay the price, especially when alternatives aren’t available domestically.

Relocating industries to the US won’t solve everything, especially in sectors like tech or textiles where manufacturing is too costly to move without major price hikes.

1mjovtc,2025-08-07,"US is still the place to invest
Even with all the turmoil and uncertainty the US is still the place to invest.

What are the alternatives? China? Can’t trust their numbers. And you definitely can’t trust their government. Anytime a Chinese company gets too powerful it gets stomp by the CCP.

Europe? Hell no. Way too much regulation. Way too much taxation. Absolutely terrible place to grow a business. 

Brazil? Russia? Emerging markets? Good luck with that.

The USA is absolutely dominating big tech. Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and NVIDIA. And the current administration will let these companies continue their monopolies as long as they pay the president tribute. Which for these trillion dollar companies is a rounding error.

But the dollar is crashing? Nonsense. The dollar is stronger than in 2020-2022 and 2003-2016. Don’t be fooled by propagandists who are pushing a narrative. 


These other countries have one big advantage: they're run by governments that aren't actively trying to destroy their nations. Can we really trust the US numbers much longer though? Trump will just continue firing whoever reports inconvenient facts until every position is filled by a loyalist willing to lie for him. Idk what the alternative is though, I'm still buying US.. [deleted] [deleted] Enron says what? You sound like a typical American who doesn’t even own a passport and has never traveled outside the U.S. Too much taxation in Europe? What are you talking about? Monaco, for example, is tax-free. In fact, many American companies have moved to Europe, especially to Amsterdam, because of better corporate tax rates.

You say you can’t trust China? Well, guess what, China is far more modern than you might imagine. The same goes for Russia. You’ve clearly fallen for Western propaganda and, like many Americans, don’t seem to know much about the world.

Did you know the largest chipmaker in the world, ASML, is based in Europe? Probably not. Some of the world’s largest companies come from a small European country, the Netherlands. Think Shell, Booking, ASML, Philips, Heineken, and many others. Imagine how many more globally influential companies are based there in Europe. It’s a very large Economy. The Euro is also stronger than the dollar. 

Also, why do you only name China, Russia and Brazil as examples. Are those the only countries you could think of?

However I do agree that tech companies in the usa are pretty good investments. Especially Nvdia, palantir, apple, microsoft. Narrator: OP could not. I'm invested in Canadian stocks. They have never been higher. Plus Canada faired extremely well during the 2008 recession and the guy responsible for that is currently the Prime Minister. Climate change and natural resources are going to make Canada a world powerhouse in the next 10 to 15 years. Trump is leading the US into a hard fall. The US economy and current fiscal strategy resembles that of the 1920s. And we all know what happened then. And the US haven't learned their lesson and safeguarded against similar future issues. China is poised to easily take the lead in tech. You're kidding yourself if you think otherwise. Same with the EV market. Wrong.  Pokemon cards beat the S&P 500 and it's not even close.

1mitjqn,2025-08-06,"Google’s new AI model creates video game worlds in real time
Google DeepMind is releasing a new version of its AI “world” model, called Genie 3, capable of generating 3D environments that users and AI agents can interact with in real time. The company is also promising that users will be able to interact with the worlds for much longer than before and that the model will actually remember where things are when you look away from them.

World models are a type of AI system that can simulate environments for purposes like education, entertainment, or to help train robots or AI agents. With world models, you give them a prompt and they generate a space that you can move around in like you would in a video game, but instead of the world being handcrafted with 3D assets, it’s all being generated with AI. It’s an area Google is putting a lot of effort into; the company showed off Genie 2 in December, which could create interactive worlds based off of an image, and it’s building a world models team led by a former co-lead of OpenAI’s Sora video generation tool.
The assumption that something is a video game world, just because it is a digital world, is wrong. Video game assumes it is payable AND fun/horrifying/challenging etc. I wish they had a different term. Such as render game assets. These are cool and all but is there any AI company out there trying to utilize AI to make interactions with NPCs more dynamic and interesting? I don't think randomly generating sloppy graphics or characters is that interesting. I'd rather have a thoroughly thought out vibrant world where my actions and the progress of events cause NPCs to react accordingly and hand out quests or tasks relative to them. Until today I've not seen a well-crafted game with such functions. I think people might be missing the point with these. 

Right now all 3d engines render using lots of triangles. It’s amazing that we can get things to look so good using this technique. 

This is a completely different rending approach. I could imagine things like rendering a forest or tree, which typically are hard to do with triangles use this technique. 

3d engines use something called LOD to render far off objects. They could use this to render much higher resolution background far off in the distance instead of LOD. 

This stuff is very very interesting. Not to mention NPCs which you can talk to like real people - no more ‘I took an arrow to the knee’. Can the assets be transferred to unreal engine? And it should always be in the back of your mind that AI doesn't create it only steals, & restructures. The Unreal team demos that recently. Let's not start with this shit. Get caught? My point is the get rich off it. Moast products are just something older repackaged. 
My point was pretty clear. Music, art, movies, most things we invest for entertainment are recycled or plagiarized as it is, so if AI does it, what's the difference? At least AI didn't have to sell it soul for it.

Roberts Imperial Court is going to have to do some VERY interesting mental gymnastics. I know you are being sarcastic, but man, isn’t that a shame and indictment of the current court? 

(They will absolutely ignore precedent whenever they want.) It seems that the ""religious discrimination"" is about the bank forcing their wholesome god-fearing employees to work alongside the heretical gays.

That makes sense. There have been similar claims lately about things like porn (it's sex abuse, so we should ban it) and vaccines (also religious discrimination). The snowflake factor that’s overtaken the Republican Party is breathtaking. As if SCOTUS gives a shit about the law anymore. They’re saying republican bias includes not allowing banking to Nazis, aren’t they? 

Trump: protecting Nazis. Is it possible that the ""discrimination"" was based on some sort of credit report 🤔 sounds like George Soros deep state stuff! This is nothing more than a red herring that will allow the Trump admin to simply prosecute anyone they want to.  Basically if you don’t do business as they command, then you are discriminating. Financial Organizations dont like crypto currency companies because they have a bad habit of not following Anti-money laundering laws, and banking them means additional due diligence that those companies inevitably fail. 

When they arent literally just making money by facilitating fraud like elder exploitation.

Most literally cant be banked while remaining in compliance.

1mgif0a,2025-08-03,"Top Politician Trades Breakdown: July 2025 - What Are They Signaling?
Here’s a summary of the top 10 buys and sells by Congress this past month. Some interesting themes are emerging that might hint at what insiders expect in the months ahead.



https://preview.redd.it/vfwou904wsgf1.png?width=1256&format=png&auto=webp&s=caa0e23a3bea2da2a13bb1a53c22445b2bf20ca9

 **Top 10 Buys**

AVGO (Broadcom) - Nancy Pelosi Pelosi’s million-dollar buy into AVGO isn’t subtle. With their recent AI-related chip expansion and VMware integration closing, this may be a bet on long-term enterprise cloud and AI infrastructure growth.

US Treasury Bills - Earl Leroy Carter Classic flight to safety. With markets at all-time highs and trade noise heating up (tariff headlines), this could be a defensive hedge. Interestingly, he also sold Treasuries in the same timeframe. More on that below.

OGVXX (Money Market) - John Rose Another safety play - cash-like instruments are getting love. Could be bracing for volatility, especially with elections nearing and major tech earnings coming up.

BTCUSD (Bitcoin) - Brandon Gill Multiple buys into BTC suggest confidence and possibly anticipating more inflows or a response to a weakening dollar narrative.

University Kansas Hospital Bonds - Suzan DelBene Healthcare muni bonds at this size ($250k–$500k) could be a longer-term interest rate or infrastructure play. Not exciting, but steady.

Los Angeles CA Water Utility Bonds - Scott Peters Another muni. These are low-risk, long-term yielders - could be indicative of a rate peak thesis where bonds get reloaded.

AAL (American Airlines) - Tim Moore Surprising pick given airline volatility. Could be a bet on travel demand heading into holiday season or reversion after summer pullback.

L (Loews Corp), MKL, WTM - James French Hill All three are insurance/financial plays. Might signal expectations of rate stability or cash-generating businesses getting revalued upward.

AAPL (Apple) - Tim Moore Classic long-term hold, but interesting timing with their earnings just around the corner. Potential bet on improved guidance or new AI hype/momentum?

TD (Toronto-Dominion Bank) - Ro Khanna A cross-border financial? Possibly a rate sensitivity play or anticipation of North American banking consolidation.



https://preview.redd.it/f6f1joy4wsgf1.png?width=1254&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3ced532acfcf8b3d2b49632c4d230c2eeb7d91a

**Top 10 Sells**

US Treasury Bills - Earl Leroy Carter Yep - same guy who bought them. This could be a rollover into new durations, but could also suggest shifting allocations as yields peak.

OGVXX (Money Market) - John Rose Again, selling a cash-equivalent here. He may be rotating from safety into something else (or raising cash for new plays). Possibly speculative.

TNA (Small-Cap Bull ETF) - Tim Moore Selling leveraged small-cap exposure after a recent rally might be locking in gains - or reducing risk ahead of election-driven volatility.

SMCWX, AGTHX, CWGIX - John Rose Mutual fund trimming across growth and world funds. This could be part of broader de-risking or tax optimization.

DAL (Delta Airlines) - Dave McCormick Sold just days after earnings. Might be disappointed with guidance or concerned about fuel prices and consumer strength.

MSFT - John Rose A bold sell ahead of earnings. Could be locking in profit or anticipating weaker guidance in AI capex. 

GOOGL - John Rose Same theme - multiple big tech sells pre-earnings. 

BX (Blackstone) - James French Hill PE and REITs are sensitive to interest rates. This might suggest expectations of tighter credit or weaker returns ahead in private markets.

SFNC - James French Hill Regional bank sell - still cautious sentiment in small bank exposure. Heavily affected by rate hikes and CRE risk.

FLL - Susie Lee Smaller cap regional casino operator - likely shedding risk, or expecting slower discretionary spend in Q3.

**Final Takes**

There’s a clear theme of hedging risk and rotating defensively, especially among repeat names like John Rose and Tim Moore. Treasuries, money markets, munis, and even Bitcoin are showing up - each for different reasons, but the common thread may be caution. The big question is: What are they expecting on the macro front? Inflation resurgence? Rate volatility? A tech correction?



The August 1 tariff changes are already in effect, now the real question is how global trade partners respond. Keep an eye on potential retaliation or ripple effects in the coming days. With Jackson Hole just weeks away, any signs of volatility could be early moves from smart money repositioning ahead of the Fed.

1mghvuc,2025-08-03,"How to track live charts with a watchlist?
Hi everyone,

I'm having an issue with my broker: they don't offer live charts for free, and I have to pay an exorbitant subscription fee (10 dollars per chart, seriously?). I want to monitor my stock watchlist with real-time charts without breaking the bank. I used to rely on Yahoo Finance, but the charts often don’t update automatically, and I have to refresh the page, which is annoying. I tried TradingView, but the free version limits the watchlist size, so it’s not ideal. Google Finance isn’t live, so that’s a no-go.

Does anyone know a good website or platform (free or low-cost) that provides reliable real-time charts and a customizable watchlist without too many restrictions? I’d love to have tools like technical indicators and a smooth, bug-free experience to analyze my stocks easily. If you have any recommendations, I’d really appreciate your suggestions! 

Thanks in advance!

1mghrvv,2025-08-03,"Week Recap: Weak job market, tariffs, and no rate cut. The S&P 500 closed lower 2.36%. It's biggest weekly drop since the week of May 18. July 28, 2025 – August 1, 2025
First of all, I don't want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it visualized via closing prices from July 25 to August 1.

I had 18-week streak in Week Recap, but I took a break the last 2-week. Now, it's time for a fresh start 😀

We know that August 1 is the tariff deadline, so we can wait to high volality. As expected, the stock market closed the week in negative. The S&P 500 made 4-day losing streak.

📊 Here are the S&P 500's week-by-week results for the last 4 week,

July 3 close at 6,279.35 - July 11 close at 6,259.75 🔴 (-0.31%)

July 11 close at 6,259.75 - July 18 close at 6,296.79 🟢 (0.59%)

July 18 close at 6,296.79 - July 25 close at 6,388.64 🟢 (1.46%)

July 25 close at 6,388.64 - August 1 close at 6,238.01 🔴 (-2.36%)

🔸 Monday: This week started with good news from EU that U.S. reached a trade deal. EU will purchase $750B worth of energy and invest $600B more than previously planned. The stock market opened mixed. The S&P 500 was lower, but Nasdaq was higher. During the session, Morgan Stanley's Wilson predicted 7,200 by Mid-2026. Also, Oppenheimer raised year end target to 7,100 from 5,950. The stock market closed slightly higher. 🟢

🔸 Tuesday: The most important event was FOMC meeting in this week. Before the FOMC, the stock market opened flat. Job openings data released and fell by 275,000 to 7.437 million. Job market was weak in July. On the other hand, consumer confidence jumped 95.2 to 97.2 in July. It is still weak, but it is higher the lowest level in March. The U.S. and China have agreed to extend tariff truce, but it wasn't enough to lift. The stock market closed lower. 🔴

🔸 Wednesday: Before the session, Q2 GDP was released and came at 3.0%. Q1 was -0.5%. It's a positive sign and the stock market opened higher. During the session, FOMC meeting completed and interest rates unchanged as expected. Powell said we have made no decisions about September meeting. However, CME FedWatch tool is showing 80% possibility of 25 point rate cut in September. The stock market closed lower again. 🔴

🔸 Thursday: Before the session, Fed's favorite economic indicator that Core PCE inflation was released. Previous month data was revised to 2.8% year-over-year. July data is same as June and expectations. On the other hand, Microsoft and Meta released their earnings on Wednesday. The stocks smashed the expectations. The stock market opened higher. During the session, tariffs concerns dropped the indexes and the stock market closed lower. 🔴

🔸 Friday: And, August 1 arrived. The unemployment rate rose in July. The stock market opened lower. Tariffs on Canada were increased from 25% to 35%. Many countries were impacted this increments because they did not reach any agreement yet. Trump announced the new tariffs will start August 7. The stock market closed lower. Also, he fires head of labor statistics. The S&P 500 dropped 1.60% and it's highest single day drop since May 21. 🔴

We were in a good rally, but tariff concerns cut again. While a few countries have agreed, many are still in negotiations or something. Also, job market did not help to lift as Powell. I think, 6,400 might be highest level for a while. After the September, I'm still optimistic. 

What do you think? What do you think? How was your week?

❓ Note: Many people have asked where screenshots come from in my previous posts. I'm using Stock+ on iPhone and iPad. You can find it on the App Store. If you're using Android, I'm now sure if it's available, but you can try searching ""Stock Map"" or ""Heat Map"". 
but but but he’s a… businessman.. The rally was losing steam even before the job numbers fiasco. Probably even before the earnings season started, if we are to look at the earnings reactions. Pullback was coming nonetheless. It was inevitable. Stocks don’t always go up. Depends what inflation does. Weak job market means potential rate cut, and there’s plenty room for rate cut I agree with you. After the S&P 500 rebounded from 5k, we saw fastly recovering. Most of people have been talking about 6300-6400 bands. I think so, we will see a bit flat market until at least first rate cut in September (I hope). However, if U.S. reach an agreement with China, the situation could change. I haven't sold my part of trading portfolio yet. I will sell if recent all-time high of 6,147 broken (daily close). No.  The market participants have ignored the data for awhile.  This will go on until the wreckage of the economy is in their front yards trying to hammer down their doors.

It sure is healthy to have the fate of the entire market rest on one company How many Americans are buying index funds while not realizing ~40% of their investment is in 10 companies (highest ever) 7 companies actually. And they are all centered around & 100% banking on AI; with exception to amazon. That said, point still stands, absolutely baffling that the entire US economy rests on seven companies that are very likely heavily inflated in value. The performance of those 10 companies is the reason they’re buying Nasdaq 100 and S&P Growth Funds instead of target date funds. Saying no one uses Google is crazy. Google maps, google docs , google disk, gmail, Waymo, Gemini. Comparing Google to Kodak is beyond crazy bro.

1meigeq,2025-08-01,"The US stock market is undefeated against ex-US, the US dollar, and inflation
There's been a lot of talk about the US equities market being down in real terms as the dollar has been losing strength. That got me thinking - let's using TradingView to measure SPY (as a proxy for the overall market) against...

[SPY normalized for the US dollar](https://preview.redd.it/1tw67hf4yagf1.png?width=3019&format=png&auto=webp&s=991890ec18b7e815b19598be5dbcfb963eba588a)

I found it interesting that SPY took until 2014 to recover from the .com and 2008 crashes, however when normalizing for the US dollar, it actually fully recovered by 2011. Also, this shows how strong equities are to fight off inflation. If you have assets, inflation isn't gonna do anything to your net worth. If you don't, you're boned.

TL;DR - US equities go up and to the right, always, no matter what they're measured against.
The US has been an hegemonic power for almost a century, thats the only reason… times are changing tho The ex-US figure is the one that matters for the claim that you're making, and you can see right there on your graph that it's down since the beginning of 2025. That's what all the talk is about. It did. European Markets combined with the euro outperformed the SPX by like 10% ytd. [deleted] That assumes an independent fed and independent statistics bureau. The US is pushing closer and closer to a one party system - THEIRS. Also, the executive branch has been consolidating power and Congress has been giving away its power more and more. 

We are at a point where checks and balances are close to fully deteriorating. A president is now immune from all prosecution and can do whatever they want as long as the opposition does not hold both houses and a high majority in the senate.

If we turn to an el salvador, Turkey or Russia, US exceptionalism can end.  Do we become China where the president starts really meddling with companies?  

While it isnt the end, Americans are becoming more and more ok with a centralization of power where Congress isnt even needed Yes, that's what inflation is. China isn’t the richest nation. US still continues to hold that title.

PPP is irrelevant when comparing two countries output in global economy, GDP is better. PPP is better when looking at domestic metrics. 

Even by national wealth, US leads. You should read more about China. They are already the richest nation and largest trade partner of the world, but their technology and military is advancing fast too. I was talking YTD. Dax is up 17% ytd. Additionally the euro is up 11.4% ytd.


Comparatively the s&p 500 performed 24% worse ytd.


Edit: Even looking only at the performance since april 7th, the Dax + Euro outperformed the SPX by 2.1%.
In the end, I agree with your idea though, that you should probably not flee the US Market. It wasn't a good idea in april and it is not a good idea now. Considering the weak USD, it's even likely, that investing in the US as a foreign investor is a good idea atm.

So the US does need our metals. Who would’ve thunk. ""Willing to work""

More like America desperately needs them or else manufacturing there will be cost prohibitive. Carney is too smart to fall for Trump's bluffs. He has a PhD in economics. He was a VP at Goldman Sachs, and ran Bank of Canada and Bank of England. Only foreigner to ever run BoE. A few days ago, Aluminerie Alouette in Sept-Îles announced that it had shifted the majority of its aluminum exports from the U.S. to Europe. In January, only 4% of its output was shipped to Europe; by July, that figure had surged to 80%, according to the CEO.

Aluminerie Alouette is the largest aluminum smelter in both North and South America. Its annual production is nearly equivalent to the total yearly aluminum output of the United States.

Sure, Carney has ironclad credentials, but Sewer Mouth has...\*checks her notes\*...uh, never mind.

Poly market are just regards like us betting. Honestly zero valuable indication of what will happen. They're just not sure how the economy will react to all these tariffs. If inflation starts increasing, even if unemployment increases as well, they'll have to keep or raise rates.

The fact that inflation is still higher than target, but rates are also high, shows that something isn't quite right Yes but at least they do it with some money and not just post a reddit comment >unemployment increases

Depends. A few places are expecting them to deal with the unemployment side of their dual mandate over inflation. Ik we've had some talks with a senior economist at our bank that it is more likely than not what will happen.

President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/) on Wednesday signed on order imposing a universal 50% tariff on [copper](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/@HG.1/) imports, the latest metal he has targeted with a steep import tax.

U.S. copper prices plunged as much as 18% in after-hours trading as soon as the White House announced the new tariff rate. Copper miners [Freeport-McMoRan](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/FCX/) and [Southern Copper](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SCCO/) were down about 10% and more than 6%, respectively.

Why make anything in America if all your input costs will be 50% more? Can just make it in Japan or Europe. No higher costs to produce and ship to the world, Americans pay only 15% tariff tax to buy it. If you want to bring back manufacturing to the US, only an idiot would put tariffs ( new taxes) on the materials and resources needed to manufacture. Yes, you are right.

>Note before the read: Not a professional or any predictor. Only personal perspective, please do your own research before doing any investing.   


📉 **Signal 1: Stocks vs. Bonds — Expected Returns Near Convergence**  
The first chart compares expected returns of the S&P 500 and 10-year U.S. Treasuries. The spread is now near zero—meaning equities and bonds are offering similar prospective returns. This often signals an overheated equity market and may trigger capital rotation back into bonds.

  
📊 **Signal 2: Overextended Breadth**  
The second chart shows the percentage of S&P 500 stocks trading above their 50-day moving average. Once again, it has surpassed the 75% threshold—levels that have marked local peaks at least twice in the past year.

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

This has caused the stock to surge afterhours yesterday. Interestingly, the stock was worth $35 before the ELEVIDYS news even happened, but we haven't resurged. So I'm a little wary of this because we haven't been going back all the way. Worth watching at the open.

From what I've read online, many people expected the CEO to be an American (because the main market for the weight-loss drugs is America because our obesity rate is so high).

1mc2o6j,2025-07-29,"B uyers lined up for the latest two‑year Japanese Government Bond
Buyers lined up for the latest two year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) auction in much greater numbers than usual.  A bid to cover ratio of 4.47 means that investors offered to buy roughly 4½ times the amount of bonds on offer; that beats both last month’s 3.90 and the twelve‑month average of just under 4.0.  The “tail” – the gap between the average and the worst price accepted – was only 0.005 yen, about half the size recorded at the prior sale, and the yield slipped two basis points to 0.82 percent once the auction cleared.  Those are classic signs of a well‑supported sale.

Why are investors scrambling for the front end when headlines all month have focused on shaky demand for long‑dated JGBs?  First, the absolute level of the two‑year yield is the highest since 2008.  Domestic banks, insurers and money market funds that until recently earned almost nothing on cash can now pick up a positive return with minimal duration risk; the securities also qualify as top tier collateral in Bank of Japan liquidity operations.  Second, the policy outlook is relatively settled in the near term.  Markets expect the BOJ to keep its short‑term policy rate anchored at 0.50 percent at this week’s meeting and to postpone the next hike until later in the year, so locking in 0.80 bplus percent for two years looks attractive for cash‑management desks￼.

By contrast, investors remain uneasy about bonds further out the curve.  Weak demand at recent 20‑ and 30 year auctions and a spike in the 10 year yield to 1.6 percent highlight concerns over Japan’s heavy debt load and political uncertainty around fiscal policy.  The result is a pronounced steepening of the JGB curve: strong buying pressure at the short end, sellers dominating the long end.  The front‑end bid therefore tells us less about renewed faith in Japan’s public finances and more about a tactical preference for liquid, high‑quality assets with limited rate‑risk.

For the BOJ, a smoothly covered two‑year sale is good news.  It suggests that, despite the turmoil in longer maturities, the central bank’s gradual exit from yield‑curve control has not triggered a disorderly sell‑off across the whole market.  If the pattern holds, the Bank can keep tapering its bond purchases at the short end without worrying about a collateral shortage, while focusing any intervention on pockets of stress further out the curve.

Bottom line: the auction shows that investors still have an appetite for short‑dated JGBs now that yields finally compensate them for inflation and policy risk.  It does not, however, resolve the bigger question hanging over Japan’s market - whether buyers will eventually return in force to the superlong sector, or whether elevated fiscal and political risk will keep the back end under pressure even as the front end finds solid support.
Do you think investors are returning capital to Japan from American markets ? (Reverse carry trade) Capital is rebalancing, not fleeing imo.  Investors are shortening duration at home and trimming the positions that look unrewarding once currency hedge costs are netted out.  Unless yen appreciation accelerates or U.S. / Japan yield spreads compress much further, the “reverse carry trade” will likely stay a controlled leak. Is this the Japan Reverse Carry.

1mat8hy,2025-07-27,"After Japan, EU has surrendered ....
Hello everyone,

I had made a post to explain why the EU would crack and accept all of Trump’s conditions for a 15% tariff. I was insulted for spreading Trump propaganda, and my post was unfairly deleted.  
Today, the deal between the US and the EU has proven me right. European countries will have to:

* Buy extremely expensive American energy
* Invest billions in the US
* Bear a 15% tariff on goods made in Europe. And in return, Trump agrees to… pocket the money.

Someone told me, “But that’s a very fair deal.”

  
A little explanation:  
Let me give a simple example. I’m French and live in France. In France, we have a housing crisis because no one can afford to buy an apartment or even rent. We also have rising unemployment, and the government keeps tweaking the calculation criteria to avoid counting precarious workers and those no longer eligible for unemployment benefits. We’re not buying new cars anymore because they’re too expensive for us. We have no growth, and we’re not creating jobs. On top of that, among professionals, we see more and more foreign workers taking the few available jobs, and so on.  
Politically, it’s a mess. We have a neoliberal government that secretly panders to the far right by targeting Black people, Arabs, and Muslims to avoid being ousted by the parliamentary majority. We have a budget crisis because our debt is skyrocketing, because the rich pay very little in taxes, we don’t have the expected growth, and the only solution they’ve found to fill the gap is to tell people to work more for free.

And in the face of this situation, the EU is spending money on the US instead of trying to pull European countries out of this mess.

Moreover, these investments will, by their very nature, lead to a loss of jobs to the US. We’ll end up with even fewer jobs.

This is how Von der Leyen defends European interests. Yes, Trump is extorting other countries, but he’s doing it for the benefit of the US. It’s the US that will take our jobs. Because we’re not China, our jobs aren’t about making €1 T-shirts. Our jobs are in heavy industry, like in the US, car manufacturing, luxury goods, and so on… everything can be relocated to the US.
They're buying time. If you think the big tech companies are moving manufacturing jobs to the US, I have a bridge to sell you. Surrendered to what exactly? None of the trade deals that have been announced favor the US consumer. They are all new taxes on imported goods, and the supposed deals where we sell to them are either already happening or never will because it’s not something they want or need (see Australia and beef). Not to mention if imported goods become more expensive, then domestic products become more attractive so we wouldn’t be able to scale production up to meet US demand plus international demand. Don't embarrass yourself, von der Leyen has little power; she is the chairman of a board made up of heads of state.

The deal was approved by consensus by those heads of state, blaming her is just immature. I'm joining. As an EU citizen I am disgusted by the lack of courage and vision of European leaders. I am a convinced pro-European, but if this is to be Europe, let it dissolve today. These are the ashes of what was and what could have been.

Sometimes the medicine is worse than the disease itself. We had to continue on our way, make everything collapse and force Trump either to surrender or resign. This will only lead to years of slow decline, both for the EU and the US. We have started to wage war among ourselves, when our enemies are others. Americans and Europeans should unite and send this corrupt and incompetent bunch home. You think the manufacturing of those items will go back to the US? Not to mention, none of these are actual deals. All agreements to frameworks or ""commitments"", etc... “Promised investment.”  This is what you need to zero in on bro. That means nada. China “promised” to spend billions on agriculture during the first Trump admin trade war and guess what?  They didn’t buy shit and we (taxpayers) wound up subsidizing the farmers (with our tax dollars) and it cost more than we got from revenue from the actual tariffs. In other words, we lost money. That’s how Trump works bro. I’ve been following him since the 1980s. If you believe anything he says, you’re just another sucker in a long line of suckers. You will learn someday, if you ever accept reality and math. [deleted] What did they surrender? What's in the deal? Can you post any of the actual details of the deal?

1mz2emt,2025-08-24,"$PSTV Recap and Update: NCCN SOC, SNO ASCO Reyobiq Results, Texas Rollout, Insider Incentives

Recent updates continue to build momentum for PSTV. Trial data across multiple programs targeting very difficult cancers has been strong. IND clearance is complete. Financials flipped from an expected loss of $-0.09 to a profit of $+0.02. That $0.11 swing versus expectations is a major turnaround for a biotech at this stage.

ReSPECT LM results are especially compelling
At the SNO ASCO CNS Metastases Conference, Plus presented Phase 1 data for Reyobiq in leptomeningeal metastases showing:
• 76% radiographic response rate and 87% clinical response through day 112
• 100% reduction in CSF tumor cells by day 28
• Median overall survival of 9 months in cohorts 1-4, compared with about 4 months typically seen
• Among patients with more than 80% tumor cell reduction, 5 of 7 survived at least 1 year

These results are striking in a disease where survival is usually measured in weeks. Safety was favorable, with no dose limiting toxicities observed.

Other active trials
• ReSPECT GBM is targeting recurrent glioblastoma, one of the most aggressive brain cancers. Safety has been established and dose optimization is underway.
• ReSPECT PBC is focused on pediatric brain cancer, where the FDA has cleared the IND to allow trials to begin. This opens the door for a critical unmet need in children.

Additional catalysts
• The NCCN guidelines update was unusual because it came before FDA approval. The CSF guidance matches exactly what Plus is doing, and they are the only company with this approach. That places CNSide effectively at the level of Standard of Care in advance of approval.
• The Test and Treat platform combines diagnostic testing with direct treatment in the same fluid compartment. The ability to test and deliver therapy together in one system is unique.
• The Texas rollout is already integrating Plus into hospitals, running trials directly in the care environment where patients are treated.
• On compliance, the company’s filing makes it clear that Nasdaq may grant an exception of up to 180 days, which would extend to November 17 if the plan is accepted. This indicates a pathway is available as stated in the filing. .
• Plus also filed for authorization of up to 20 million shares under its employee incentive plan. The S-8 filing shows:
– 20,000,000 shares added to the 2020 Stock Incentive Plan, amended July 17 and approved August 7, 2025
– 75,000 shares added under the 2015 Employee Incentive Plan

Who received these and why it matters
• CEO Marc Hedrick received 5,748,506 stock options with an exercise price of $0.5744 expiring August 12, 2035, vesting monthly over 4 years. He also received 1,916,168 RSUs vesting one-third after 1 year and the rest monthly over the following 2 years.
• A director received 337,794 options in 2 tranches, both at the same exercise price, vesting over 12 and 24 months with acceleration tied to the 2026 annual meeting.

This structure keeps leadership aligned with shareholders through long term incentives and shows confidence in the growth story.

Bottom Line
Between multiple trial programs in leptomeningeal metastases, glioblastoma, and pediatric brain cancer, NCCN guidance that already aligns Plus with Standard of Care, strong positive presentations at SNO ASCO, the unique Test and Treat platform, rollout into hospitals in Texas, positive trial data, financial improvement with an $0.11 beat over expectations, the compliance pathway through November, and insider incentives, Plus is positioned well.

The recent dip in share price looks more like certain groups playing games with the stock than any reflection of fundamentals. The fundamentals have only strengthened.

TLDR Active trials in LM, GBM, and pediatric brain cancer, NCCN SOC, SNO ASCO Reyobiq results, Test and Treat platform, hospital rollout, financial turnaround, compliance pathway, insider incentives. Fundamentals strong. Do your own DD!

1mymxgw,2025-08-24,"Opendoor vs Gme
Stock Performance Comparison: for GME & OPENDOOR TECHNOLOGY 

GameStop (GME) on January 28, 2021 vs. Opendoor Technologies (OPEN) on August 23, 2025
GameStop (GME) on January 28, 2021:
•  Price Action: On January 28, 2021, GME reached its all-time high closing price of $120.75 (split-adjusted) during the peak of the meme stock frenzy, with intraday highs exceeding $500 pre-split (~$125 split-adjusted). The stock surged due to a short squeeze driven by retail investors on Reddit’s r/wallstreetbets, with prices doubling daily in late January. From $17.25 at the start of January, it climbed nearly 30x by January 28.
•  Volume: Trading volume was extraordinary, with millions of shares changing hands daily, peaking at levels that overwhelmed brokerages like Robinhood, which halted trading.
•  Market Context: GME’s market cap was approximately $3 billion before the surge, ballooning to over $20 billion at its peak. The rally was fueled by retail coordination against short sellers, with short interest exceeding 140% of the float, causing massive losses for hedge funds like Melvin Capital (down 53% in January).
•  Fundamentals: GME was a struggling retailer with declining sales due to digital gaming trends. Revenue in 2020 was $6.47 billion, down from prior years, with consistent losses. The stock’s price was detached from fundamentals, driven purely by speculative momentum.
Opendoor Technologies (OPEN) on August 23, 2025:
•  Price Action: OPEN closed at $5.01 on August 22, 2025, after surging from $0.51 in late June, a ~880% increase in less than two months. The stock hit a 52-week high of $5.08, with a recent 40%+ daily jump.
•  Volume: Volume spiked to 628.45 million shares on August 22, far above its average of 221.38 million, with call option activity hitting record highs (over 1 million contracts traded daily). This mirrors GME’s 2021 frenzy in terms of retail-driven trading intensity.
•  Market Context: OPEN’s market cap is ~$3.69 billion, similar to GME’s pre-squeeze valuation in early 2021. The rally, sparked by Eric Jackson’s bullish X post on July 14, 2025, and amplified by Reddit’s WallStreetBets, has drawn GameStop comparisons.
•  Fundamentals: OPEN remains unprofitable, with a negative EPS of -$0.43 and no PE ratio. It sold ~3,000 homes annually in 2023 and 2024, operating in a sluggish housing market. Despite this, retail sees potential in AI-driven efficiencies and a housing market rebound due to expected rate cuts.
Comparison: Both stocks exhibit speculative, retail-driven surges detached from fundamentals. GME’s 2021 run was more extreme (30x vs. OPEN’s 8.8x), but OPEN’s recent 188% weekly gain and 600%+ monthly rise echo GME’s rapid ascent. Both had similar pre-rally market caps (~$3 billion), but GME’s peak was far higher. OPEN’s rally is fresher, with momentum tied to macro tailwinds (e.g., falling rates), while GME’s was purely squeeze-driven.
Short Interest Comparison
GME on January 28, 2021:
•  Short Interest: Short interest was ~140% of the public float, an unprecedented level that fueled the short squeeze. Approximately 67 million shares were shorted, with hedge funds like Melvin Capital and Citadel heavily exposed.
•  Days to Cover: Exact days-to-cover data for January 28 is unavailable, but the high short interest and massive volume suggested shorts were trapped, unable to cover quickly, driving prices higher. Losses for short sellers reached ~$20 billion in January.
•  Impact: The extreme short interest, combined with retail buying and media attention, caused a feedback loop where covering shorts pushed prices even higher, leading to GME’s parabolic move.
OPEN on August 23, 2025:
•  Short Interest: As of July 31, 2025, 150.2 million shares were shorted, representing 23.60% of the float and 20.41% of shares outstanding, up from 135.84 million the prior month.
•  Days to Cover: The short ratio is 0.63 days, reflecting the massive recent volume (e.g., 628 million shares on August 22), which allows shorts to cover quickly if needed.
•  Impact: High short interest (23.60% of float) is significant but far below GME’s 140%. Retail posts on X highlight OPEN as a squeeze candidate, with sentiment boosted by avoided delisting and gamma squeeze potential from call buying.
Comparison: GME’s short interest in 2021 was exponentially higher (140% vs. 23.60%), making its squeeze more explosive. OPEN’s short interest is substantial but more manageable, with lower days to cover indicating shorts can exit faster due to high liquidity. Both benefited from retail coordination, but GME’s squeeze was a rare, once-in-a-generation event due to its extreme short float.
Retail Sentiment Comparison
GME on January 28, 2021:
•  Sentiment: Retail sentiment was euphoric, driven by r/wallstreetbets’ “apes” coordinating to “hold the line” against hedge funds. Social media (Reddit, Twitter) amplified the narrative of retail investors battling Wall Street, with figures like Roaring Kitty (Keith Gill) galvanizing the movement. The “MOASS” (Mother of All Short Squeezes) thesis dominated, with investors refusing to sell despite volatility.
•  Catalysts: Frequent Reddit mentions, mainstream media coverage, and high short interest were key drivers. The SEC later noted retail buying wasn’t the sole factor, but it was primary in sparking the squeeze. Sentiment was defiant, with “diamond hands” (holding through dips) becoming a cultural phenomenon.
•  Community: The GME community was highly organized, using Reddit and Twitter to share DD (due diligence), track short interest, and call out brokerages like Robinhood for halting trades.
OPEN on August 23, 2025:
•  Sentiment: Retail sentiment is strongly bullish, with X posts and Reddit’s WallStreetBets buzzing about OPEN as “the next GameStop.” Influential investors like Eric Jackson (predicting $82/share) and Anthony Pompliano have fueled optimism, comparing OPEN to Carvana’s recovery. Retail sees it as a “100-bagger” with upside from falling rates, AI efficiencies, and a tight housing supply.
•  Catalysts: Eric Jackson’s July 14 X post triggered a 140% surge in trading activity, with Reddit mentions up 200%. High call option volume and hedge fund buying (e.g., Paul Tudor Jones) add credibility. Sentiment is bolstered by avoiding Nasdaq delisting and macro tailwinds.
•  Community: Retail is active on X and Reddit, sharing trade screenshots and squeeze predictions. Posts call for leadership changes (e.g., new CEO) and highlight institutional buying (39% of shares, up 5.5%). Sentiment is speculative but less ideologically charged than GME’s anti-Wall Street crusade.
Comparison: Both stocks saw intense retail enthusiasm driven by social media (Reddit for GME, X and Reddit for OPEN). GME’s 2021 sentiment was more militant, rooted in a David-vs-Goliath narrative, with a tightly knit community. OPEN’s sentiment is optimistic but less organized, driven by recent momentum and macro bets rather than a unified “squeeze” ideology. GME’s retail base was larger and more cult-like, while OPEN’s is growing but fragmented, with some skepticism about sustainability (e.g., “apathetic grift”).
Key Takeaways
•  Stock Performance: GME’s 2021 run was far more extreme (30x vs. OPEN’s 8.8x), but OPEN’s recent surge mirrors GME’s early 2021 trajectory, with similar pre-rally market caps. OPEN’s rally is less detached from fundamentals due to real estate sector tailwinds.
•  Short Interest: GME’s 140% short float dwarfed OPEN’s 23.60%, making GME’s squeeze more violent. OPEN’s lower days to cover suggest less squeeze potential unless volume sustains.
•  Retail Sentiment: GME’s 2021 sentiment was a cultural phenomenon with deep community cohesion, while OPEN’s is speculative and momentum-driven, lacking the same ideological fervor but boosted by influential endorsements and macro trends.
Both cases highlight retail’s power to move markets, but GME’s 2021 event was a unique outlier in scale and impact. OPEN’s current run has parallels but faces a different market context, with analysts remaining bearish (e.g., $0.83 target for OPEN, $13.50 for GME). Always approach such volatile stocks with caution.
No one’s reading all that. And no, it’s not going to be like gme ChatGPT summary 

GME (2021):
🚀 +30x in a month
🔧 Driven by epic short squeeze (140% SI)
🧠 Retail vs. Wall Street, cultural moment


OPEN (2025):
📈 +8.8x in 2 months
💬 Reddit/X hype + macro hopes
📉 23.6% SI — less squeeze risk


Verdict:
GME = legendary squeeze
OPEN = hot, but not historic (yet) Paragraphs, man.  Just sayin'.  If you're going to write a wall of text, do it proper. Lmfao, not even chatgpt would want to read that, its like a code to break down with quantum computers.... Retail traders did not cause the GME squeeze. Institutional short sellers getting forced to close their positions drove the price up.

📡 Trade Signal – [Signal Strategies Trading]

🔔 TRADE ALERT –

Type: Catalyst Swing
Market: US – NASDAQ
Asset: Achieve Life Sciences (ACHV)
Entry Zone: $2.85 – $3.05
Target Prices:
• TP1: $3.60 – Pre-catalyst momentum resistance
• TP2: $4.20 – Short-term spike zone if catalyst confirmed
• TP3 (Optional): $5.30 – Previous high from early FDA speculation

Stop-Loss: $2.65 hard stop OR max 10–12% risk from entry
Confidence Level: 🟢 (High)
Time Horizon: 1–7 days post catalyst

⸻

Rationale / Notes:
ACHV is trading near support ahead of a potential FDA acceptance or PDUFA date announcement for Cytisinicline (a novel smoking cessation therapy). The low float (~15M shares) and high speculative interest make this a strong swing candidate if the catalyst hits. Previous moves have shown rapid spikes on similar news. Volume confirmation is key post-entry.

• $3.60 represents local resistance.
• $4.20–$5.30 range is realistic with heavy volume.
• Higher prices ($7–10+) require additional catalyst stacking and longer timeline.

⸻

Risk Reminder:
🚫 NFA – DYOR. This is not financial advice. Trade with proper risk management. Position sizing is crucial. Don’t chase spikes — plan entries smartly.
i like this one already positive phase 3 data don’t think this is too risky tbh. Risks are on retail driven pull back from day traders taking profit following share price increase on release of good news FDA Price prediction in a months time? I also think it will shoot up but not sure how much. Great short-term analysis. I want to add a my views as a long-term holder that have been accumulating over time:

1. Their primary candidate (Cytisinicline) will be by far the preferrable smoking cessation therapy, once it is approved, mainly because of its safety profile.

2. There is increasing evidence about the harms of vaping. Cytisinicline is closer than any other alternative to being approved as a vaping cessation therapy. Increasing efficacy results are very promising, and the safety profile is already established, so there are significant off-label opportunities here. With more and more people globally addicted to vaping, there is a huge potential for ACHV for this indication.



Overall, this will likely be a blockbuster that will generate $B over time. The recent 1 year target of $12 by *HC Wainwright* reflects the above. I set a limit order 3.30 so unless it gaps up more than 10% should get filled..🤞🏻

Do you want to know more about the new battery recycling plant in Ontario?

St. Georges Eco-Mining's battery recycling plant in Thorold, Ontario, run by their subsidiary EVSX. 

The facility, located at the Bioveld Complex in Niagara, kicked off operations in July 2024 and was originally designed to process 4,200 tons of alkaline and carbon zinc batteries annually, hitting an impressive 87.7% recycling efficiency rate-tops in Canada for single-use batteries. 

They're partnered with Call2Recycle Canada under a three-year supply agreement, which has boosted local processing-over 60% of Ontario's collected batteries now stay regional, cutting transport emissions and supporting jobs. 

EVSX secured another three-year battery supply deal with Call2Recycle in March 2025, adding 12,500 metric tons of capacity, which signals they're scaling up big time. They've also got environmental approval locked in, ensuring compliance while aiming for zero landfill waste. And set up the plant to accept all different types of battery chemistry’s. 

The plant's multi-chemistry line handles everything from household alkaline to lithium-ion and EV batteries, recovering critical minerals like lithium, nickel, and cobalt. 

Plus, they're turning battery byproducts into agricultural fertilizers, adding a revenue stream. On the expansion front, they're exploring partnerships in Italy and South Asia for tech transfers and new facilities, aiming to replicate Thorold's model globally with remote production control. 

$18M market cap, 7 cent share price - 310M O/S
 Financial report is due next week covering April-June which may have the first glimpse of some revenues. Financial report in November may show revenue from full operations.

Have not been following AMY close, Both company’s can process and sell the byproduct so I don’t see a lot of differences there. One thing I didn’t mention in my post is that SX received $3 million from the govt to work with a 3rd party to commercialize their refining technology, so it’s been proven in the labs.

1mxtyb8,2025-08-23,"ACHV — FDA NDA Acceptance to be expected Monday (99.9% odds)
Disclosure: I have 3,333 shares of $ACHV averaged at $2.6. Their drug Cytisinicline is basically the post-Chantix(nicotine cessation drug, peak sale $1.1b) with 2x better safety profile. 

I gave the source to Chatgpt and asked her to write like ""reddit degenerate style"" and here's the result. 


---

ACHV submitted their NDA for Cytisinicline on June 26, 2025.

FDA rules are clear: within 60 days of submission, they must issue either an Acceptance for Filing or a Refuse-to-File (RTF). There’s no delay option.

Do the math:

	•	Day 0 = June 26

	•	Day 60 = August 25, 2025 (Monday)

That’s the deadline. Which means FDA’s response is basically due Monday.

RTF risk? Extremely low. Why:

	•	FDA already asked for additional data in 2024, Achieve ran the extra trial work, and FDA gave the green light to submit.

	•	You don’t get told “go ahead and file” only to be RTF’d later.

Compare to Tonix (TNXP):

	•	Filed NDA Oct 17, 2024

	•	Acceptance announced Dec 16, 2024

	•	Stock jumped from $22 → $130 in one session.

So here’s what happens:

	•	Aug 25: FDA acceptance PR very likely

	•	~14 days later (Day 74): PDUFA date + review type (Standard 10mo vs Priority 6mo) announced

	•	If Priority, the market could price in a much earlier decision (Q1 2026)

ACHV is basically set up for a binary catalyst Monday premarket. Odds of acceptance are about as close to guaranteed as you get in biotech.

LFG🚀🚀🚀

Don’t use TNXP please, they did a RS! For godsake Bought some. We will see. Regardless of the RS they did 1:100, they made 6 bagger with the NDA acceptance news anyway. I was too lazy to recalculate their sp. You are lucky you are long.  So limit. .. 10 min after open?  
.. That’s the only RS stock I’ve been in that actually went up. I got out at even just because I’ve lost my ass on everyone of them Wait.  RS is a reverse split.  Oh boy.

The Acquisition proceeded pursuant to a share exchange agreement (the “**Exchange Agreement**”) entered into between the Company, Oranam, and each of the shareholders of Oranam, and dated May 12, 2025.  The Company has received conditional approval for the Acquisition and the Offerings (as defined below) from the Canadian Securities Exchange (the “**CSE**”). Resumption of trading of the common shares of the Company (each, an “**Oregen Share**”) under the symbol “ORNG” remains subject to satisfaction of the remaining filing requirements with the CSE. The Company will provide an update as to the resumption of trading of the Oregen Shares once a date has been confirmed.

Through the Acquisition, the Company has acquired an additional 36.0% gross equity interest in WestOil Limited (“**WestOil**”), a private company that owns a 70% interest in block 2712A offshore Namibia Orange Basin, one of the world’s most active offshore exploration frontiers. The Orange Basin has attracted significant industry interest following recent multi-billion-barrel discoveries in adjacent blocks, including Galp’s Mopane, TotalEnergies Venus, Shell’s Graff and Rhino/BP-ENI JV Capricornus discoveries. Block 2712A covers 5,484 km² and is strategically located near these discoveries, offering substantial exploration potential. The Company currently controls a 12.5% equity interest in WestOil through its subsidiary, NamLith Resources Corp. which represents an 8.75% net interest in Block 2712A (PEL 107).  The additional 36.0% equity interest in WestOil represents a 25.2% net interest in Block 2712A (PEL 107), thereby increasing the Company’s total net interest to 33.95% and a 48.5% equity interest in WestOil. 

**Concurrent Offerings**

In connection with the closing of the Acquisition, the Company, together with wholly-owned subsidiary, 1541585 B.C. Ltd. (“**FinanceCo**”), completed the following private placements for aggregate gross proceeds of $3,635,291, comprised of:

* the first tranche of its previously announced brokered financing comprised of 4,771,744 units of the Company (“**Oregen** **Units**”) at a price of $0.36 per Oregen Unit issued under the ‘listed issuer financing exemption’ in Part 5A of National Instrument 45-106 – *Prospectus Exemptions* for aggregate gross proceeds of $1,717,828 (the “**LIFE Offering**”) for which a second and final tranche is expected to occur in early September 2025 (the “**Second Tranche Closing**”). Each Oregen Unit consists of one Oregen Share and one Oregen Share purchase warrant (an “**Oregen Warrant**”). Each Oregen Warrant shall entitle the holder thereof to purchase one Oregen Share at an exercise price of $0.54 until August 13, 2027, subject to accelerated expiry in certain circumstances (as set out below); and
* the previously announced brokered financing comprised of 5,326,286 units (the “**FinanceCo Units**”) of FinanceCo at a price of $0.36 per FinanceCo Unit issued in a private placement under the “accredited investor” exemption for aggregate gross proceeds of $1,917,463 (the “**Private Placement Offering**” and together with the LIFE Offering, the “**Offerings**”). Each FinanceCo Unit consists of one common share of FinanceCo (“**FinanceCo Share**”) and one FinanceCo Share purchase warrant (a “**FinanceCo Warrant**”). Each FinanceCo Warrant shall entitle the holder thereof to purchase one FinanceCo Share at an exercise price of $0.54 until August 13, 2027.

The Offerings were led by Research Capital Corp., as lead agent and sole bookrunner, on behalf of a syndicate of agents including Canaccord Genuity Corp. and Roth Canada Inc. (the “**Agents**”).

Pursuant to a three-cornered amalgamation under and subject to the terms and conditions of an amalgamation agreement dated August 13, 2025 among the Company, FinanceCo and another wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, the FinanceCo Shares and FinanceCo Warrants were exchanged for 5,326,286 Oregen Shares and 5,326,286 Oregen Warrants on a one-for-one basis.

Each of the Oregen Warrants underlying the Oregen Units and Broker Warrants (as defined below), and those issued in exchange for FinanceCo Warrants pursuant to the Acquisition, will become exercisable on the date that is the later of: (a) October 12, 2025; and (b) 60 days following the Second Tranche Closing date; provided that if the Second Tranche Closing date has not occurred by October 12, 2025, the Warrants shall become exercisable on such date. The Company has applied to list the Warrants on the CSE and the Warrants are expected to begin trading on the CSE under the symbol “ORNG.WT” on the CSE shortly after the Warrants are eligible to be exercised.

The net proceeds of the Private Placement Offering were used for the Acquisition, working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes. The net proceeds from the LIFE Offering will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.

**Transaction Summary**

Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired all of the outstanding share capital of Oranam in consideration of a one-time cash payment of USD$1,000,000 and the issuance of 22,000,000 common shares in the capital of the Company (“**Oregen Shares**”) to the existing shareholders of Oranam (the “**Consideration Shares**”).

Following the completion of the Acquisition, the leadership team the Company has been reconstituted to consist of: (i) Mason Granger, CEO and a director; (ii) Sean McGrath, CFO and a director; (iii) Stuart Munro, VP of Exploration; (iv) Michael Humphries, director and (v) Ken Brophy, director.

The Company is at arms-length from Oranam and its shareholders.  No finders’ fee is payable in connection with completion of the Acquisition. In connection with closing of the Acquisition, certain of the holders of the Consideration Shares have agreed to an eighteen-month escrow arrangement whereby 10% of shares held by such holders are freely tradeable as of the date hereof and the remaining shares being released in three (3) equal tranches of 30% every six months following the date hereof.

* 10+ offshore wells to be drilled in Orange Basin, Namibia by major companies (2025)
* Farm-out process (2026)

**Additional Offering Details**

In the event that the volume weighted average trading price of the Oregen Shares on the CSE, or other principal exchange on which the Oregen Shares are listed, is equal to or greater than $0.72 for any 20 consecutive trading days, the Company may, within 10 business days of the occurrence of such event, deliver a notice to the holders of Oregen Warrants accelerating the expiry date of the Oregen Warrants to the date that is 30 days following the date of such notice (the “**Accelerated Exercise Period**”). Any unexercised Oregen Warrants shall automatically expire at the end of the Accelerated Exercise Period.

The Agents were granted an option to increase the size of the LIFE Offering by up to an additional 15% in Units, exercisable in whole or in part up to two business days before the Second Tranche Closing.

The Broker Warrants and the securities underlying the Broker Warrants are subject to a hold period in accordance with applicable Canadian securities law, expiring four months and one day following the issue date. The Units, as well as the Oregen Shares and Oregen Warrants issued to former holders of FinanceCo securities in connection with the Acquisition, and the underlying securities, as applicable, will not be subject to any statutory or other hold period.

In connection with the Offerings, the Company paid cash commission of $190,293 and issued 607,760 broker warrants (the “**Broker Warrants**”) to the Agents. Each Broker Warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire one Oregen Unit at a price of $0.36 per Oregen Unit until August 13, 2027. Each Oregen Unit underlying the Broker Warrants is comprised of one Oregen Share and one Oregen Warrant (each, a “**Broker Warrant Unit Warrant**”), with each Broker Warrant Unit Warrant exercisable for one Oregen Share at a price of $0.54 until August 13, 2027, subject to accelerated expiry in certain circumstances (as set out above). 

**Name Change to Oregen Energy Corp.** 

Concurrent with closing of the Acquisition and the Offerings, the Company also changed its name (the “**Name Change**”) to “Oregen Energy Corp.”  Resumption of trading of the common shares of the Company (each, an “**Oregen Share**”) under the symbol “ORNG” remains subject to satisfaction of the remaining filing requirements with the CSE. The new CUSIP will be 685768103 and the new ISIN will be CA6857681036. A copy of the certificate and articles of amendment evidencing the change of name has been filed on SEDAR+. 

**Listing Statement**

In connection with the Acquisition and pursuant to the CSE requirements, the Company filed a listing statement under its profile on SEDAR+, which contains relevant details regarding the Acquisition, Oranam, WestOil and the resulting issuer.

**Related Party Disclosure**

Each of Mason Granger, Chief Executive Officer and director of the Company, and Roger March, a director of the Company (the “**Related Parties**”) who resigned concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition, participated in the LIFE Offering. The participation by the Related Parties is considered a “related party transaction” for the purposes of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 – *Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions* (“**MI 61-101**”). However, such participation is not subject to the minority approval and formal valuation requirements under MI 61-101 since there is an applicable exemption from these requirements as neither the fair market value of the subject matter, nor the fair market value of the consideration for the transaction, insofar as it involves the Related Parties, exceeded 25% of the Company’s market capitalization. The Related Parties had previously disclosed their interest in the LIFE Offering to the board of directors of the Company (the “**Board**”).

The LIFE Offering was approved unanimously by consent resolution of the Board. The Company intends to file a material change report following the closing of the LIFE Offering with details of the participation in the LIFE Offering by the Related Parties. A material change report was not filed 21 days prior to the closing of the LIFE Offering pursuant to MI 61-101, but the Company deemed this timing to be reasonable in the circumstances in order to permit it to be able to avail itself of the financing opportunities and complete the LIFE Offering in an expeditious manner. 

**About Oregen Energy Corp.** 

Oregen is an investment company primarily focused on oil and gas assets in Africa. The Company is actively exploring other investment opportunities in the Orange and surrounding basins. Its current flagship investment is 33.95% net interest in Block 2712A in the Orange Basin offshore Namibia, an emerging world-class petroleum province with multiple recent discoveries by major operators.

Just sharing my morning research:

FibroBiologics Inc. (NASDAQ: FBLG) is poised for a significant breakthrough, as evidenced by their recent patent publication, WO2025117451A1, detailing the therapeutic use of fibroblasts to treat the common cold. This innovation underscores the company's commitment to leveraging fibroblast technology to address widespread health concerns.[Google Patents](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2025117451A1/en?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# Key Highlights of the Patent:

* **Innovative Treatment Approach**: The patent introduces methods and compositions utilizing fibroblasts and fibroblast-derived materials to treat or prevent the common cold and its symptoms, irrespective of the causative virus.[Google Patents+2GlobeNewswire+2](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2025117451A1/en?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Enhanced Fibroblast Activation**: By exposing fibroblasts to specific conditions and compounds, such as toll-like receptor agonists like Poly IC, the cells' antiviral properties are amplified, leading to increased production of interferons and interleukins.[Google Patents](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2025117451A1/en?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Versatile Administration Methods**: The treatments can be administered through various routes, including intranasal sprays, intravenous injections, and oral formulations, offering flexibility in therapeutic applications.
* **Personalized Medicine Potential**: The approach allows for customization based on individual immune profiles, paving the way for tailored treatments that align with patients' unique needs.[Google Patents](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2025117451A1/en?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# Implications for FibroBiologics Inc.:

This patent not only expands FibroBiologics' intellectual property portfolio but also positions the company at the forefront of fibroblast-based therapeutics. By addressing a ubiquitous ailment like the common cold, the company demonstrates the broad applicability of its technology, potentially leading to significant market opportunities and growth.[Stock Titan+1](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/FBLG/fibro-biologics-files-patent-for-methods-of-generating-multipotent-0h43c73ablpr.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Google Patents](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2025117451A1/en?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Really impressive stuff from $FBLG. This fibroblast approach for the common cold is next level. They are having financial issues from what I found out. If I understood it right, they have enough money to last about a year. With that I’d say 0.5 per share is a lot and I’d expect it to drop some more.

1mwclrk,2025-08-21,"GXAI:NASDAQ
Some research on GXAI:

[Gaxos.ai](http://Gaxos.ai) (NASDAQ: GXAI) is an AI-focused technology company with a diverse portfolio of products. Their offerings include:

    - UNGPT: An AI Text Humanizer & SEO Writer
    
    - ART-GEN: An AI tool for image and video creation and transformation
    
    - GAXOS GAMING LABS: An AI monetization and development tool for game developers and publishers
    
    - Gaxos Health: An AI-powered service for customized health and wellness plans
    
    - Gaxos Gaming: An AI and blockchain-powered gaming platform

They have a market cap just shy of 20 million USD. They have been diluting shareholders for sometime now, with their diluted average shares going from 1,008,000 to 4,770,000 in 3 years. The price is just about 2.25$ / per share.

This money has mostly gone into operating expenses (about 4 million USD per year): mostly into SG&A (about 75% of op. expenses), and the rest in R&D. As of the last earnings report, they have 14 million USD in cash & short term investments with 0 long term debt. This money will most likely go to operating expenses.

In term of revenue, they are growing quickly through a multiple tier subscription plans for their multiple AI products. All are accessed through a web browser, and they all seem like good tools. They are built upon Gemini and GPT, with their own proprietary tweaks.

Revenue in thousands is: 0.26 in 2023, 4.03 in 2024, and 198.71 in the TTM.

I believe this stock can double from here if the revenue keeps growing quickly. When the company is finally profitable on a cash flow basis, i dont see why this couldnt be a 100 million dollar company.

Management seem to have a lot of experience as well:

    - Vadim Mats is the Chairman & CEO of Gaxos.ai, with a background as a CFO and an Assistant Controller. He is a CAIA Charterholder and a Certified Public Accountant.
    
    - Steven A. Shorr is the Chief Financial Officer, a Certified Public Accountant with over 30 years of experience in finance and accounting.
    
    - Manny Benor, the Head of Operations, has over 15 years of experience in digital marketing and adtech, including founding Mode Technologies, Inc.
    
    - Adam Holzer is a Director and a media executive with over 30 years of experience, having held leadership roles at companies like FOX, Turner Broadcasting, and was part of the team that launched Hulu.

The risks are: - They run out of cash before the company becomes profitable, and they keep burning investors money and diluting shareholders. - They are competing against tech. giants: Google, Microsoft, etc... - It may be that their technology is actually subpar, hard to tell for now.
Nice I'll look into it, thanks Meh, RZLV is the thing. Was checking out their UNGPT and ART-GEN tools the other day tbh, they seem pretty user-friendly but couldn't find much real user feedback anywhere. Dilution does worry me a bit, especially since that's like 4x the shares in just three years, and they're basically burning through cash just to keep the lights on. Feels like they're in full-on growth mode.

Have you tried any of their subscription tiers? Curious what the actual product experience is. It's wild to see the revenue jump like that, but it's such a small company and with zero debt that's kinda rare in tech. I wonder how sticky those users are. Do you think their proprietary tweaks to Gemini/GPT give them any real edge? Seems to me competition is cutthroat in this space - other AI humanizers like AIDetectPlus and Quillbot are getting pretty aggressive about unique features.

I'm lowkey interested to see a breakdown on how much they're making from gaming vs. health vs. content. If one of those somehow picks up and SG&A chills out, maybe it does pop. You're thinking of picking up shares or just watching for now? Would you mind explaining 🤔 They have funding already.  ARR growing faster than expected. Blackrock grew position hugely end of June. Vanguard, jane street also. Check Fintel.

Partnership with Microsoft and Google. Multiple other mid big names from other sectors.

There is huge volume increase for Sep 19 5$ Call option.

^(if) ^(you) ^(have) ^(any) ^(questions) ^(or) ^(concerns.) What is your price target? Just got in and already have a nice gain I have tried unGEN and ArtGEN and I was impressed with the results. But im impressed with all new AI tools.... So is it really better than all the other models at doing these specific tasks? Yes, a bit. But probably not better enough to justify the premium subscription. To me their product doesn't really differentiate them from others in the space. But I haven't really spend enough time to really get an idea of how they compare to their competitors. 

Fortunately, the pitch relies more on them becoming profitable in the next year or two. So this is more of a trade where I expect a quick rerating of the stock. To me, the important question is how long before they breach 4 million $ / year in revenue. In the short term, this is less about how much better the product is, and more about how well they can market their services.

 I had some stock at 1.92 which I sold at 2.60. I'm still holding onto shares bought at 1.72. I will hold these until atleast the next quarter. This is a very small part of my portfolio.

Thanks for the comment. I'll be selling as it goes up. Sold some at 2.50ish, I'll sell more at 3.5-4. Realistically I want to hold until after next earnings.

1mwaz5x,2025-08-21,"$CGTX - What NEXT? Why is it keep going up?
CGTX has been mentioned here several times already including my previous two posts, and there are people who decided to get into the stock after reading my posts or other fellow CGTX believers' post. I would like to congratulate them first. CGTX has finally started to get into the right direction after a long period of undervaluation and doubts.

There are several reasons for the strength in the stock price momentum and I truly believe this is only the beginning, and I would like to explain why. And with whatever information I give you, please do a due diligence of doing your own research and cross checking for the validation of the facts.

There have been several posts explaining the pipeline, results etc... so I'll just focus on explaining why it's going up and will likely to continue to go up in long term. 

**1) CGTX is still severely undervalued**  
Compare the current market cap with any clinical stage bio firm who entered phase 3 and are aiming to develop a treatment for ""major"" diseases, you will realise CGTX is still heavily discounted. Furthermore, CGTX's phase 3 design for AD is two 6 months trials, which is an extraordinarily short period in this sector.

Yes, even with a shortened trial period, it will not happen immediately as some may think. If CGTX (with a potential partner) start recruiting 2026 Q2  - expect 6\~12 months of recruiting time and trial will end around end of 2027, and with data processing add another half a year or so. Expect a minimum of 3 years from now. HOWEVER, in normal circumstances, with a typical trial period of 18-24 months, this would take a minimum 4.5 years. This is a huge advantage for potential buyers.

Furthermore, CGTX has another heavy weight pipeline, which is DLB treatment. We are all waiting for BTD decision, but BTD or not, it doesn't affect the company in the long term. Even if BTD is denied for whatever reason (efficacy not being primary endpoint from SHIMMER design, or lack of participants, etc...) CGTX can opt for Fast Track instead, and the process of preparing for DLB phase 3 will progress as planned. BTD or not, amazing results of SHIMMER don't change.

Another great asset is phase 2 trial MAGNIFY, which has shown a great result and potential showing similar or better efficacy than approved drugs for dry AMD, another ageing related disease. Interim data has been released already, and the results are super promising. Daily pill showing equal or better results than approved drugs, which all require direct injection into your eyes. If I were a patient, I would choose daily pill over monthly eye injection for sure.

**What does this all mean?**  
You have to understand the great potential of Zervimesine (CT1812) and understand how it works.  
You can do your own research for medical and technical terms, I will just try to explain it in simple words.

In diseases like Alzheimer’s, Lewy body dementia, or even eye disease (dry AMD), tiny toxic protein fragments (amyloid) float around and stick to nerve cells. When they stick, they damage the cells and block their signals, which leads to memory loss or vision problems.

CT1812 chemical reaches these cells through blood and attaches to sigma-recepter, which is a doorway to the toxic fragments, and CT1812 chemical will loosen the toxic protein waste and remove them and stop new toxic fragments forming on the nerve cells.

As the results of is its mechanism, the connection between cells (synapse) are protected, and in some cases, they will re-establish connection. This mechanism is likely to be slowing down dementia, AD, and even on eye disease caused by toxic protein build-up via sigma-receptors.

Currently, the main focus is on Alzheimer and Dementia with Lewy Bodies due to financial limits, but you can imagine potential expansion of the research. One pill is already working for restricting the progress of AD, DLB, and dry-AMD. Endless possibilities.

CGTX made a strategical decision to terminate MAGNIFY (dry AMD) phase 2 in the middle for the fund reasons, and focused on AD and DLB as they were both supported by generous amount of government grant totalling $171M, which is already something that is unheard of in this sector. We can get a sense how the potential of CT1812 is received by NIA/NIH.

Combining the promising results and favourable feedbacks from the FDA, CGTX will be very attractive for big pharmas to consider establishing a partnership.

**2) Series of upcoming catalysts and background to a groundbreaking AD Phase 3.**  
The company is under a risk of delisting due to NASDAQ compliance issues and will need to stay over $1 for three more days. Which is very likely to be met considering the current circumstances.

**A) No more delisting risk --> institution + investor flow**  
Once delisting risk has been lifted, there are only catalysts that are on the horizon. Once the delisting risk is gone, institutional funds will flow in, and more confidence from retail investors as well.

**B) Possible approval of BTD**  
Expected in 1\~3 weeks : even if denied, not catastrophe and the company doesn't have to announce denial immediately, CGTX will probably apply for Fast Track and announce later by saying despite denial of BTD, Fast Track has been applied, or report it during the next ER. If approved, it will help to boost stock price and investor confidence for the short term.

**C) DLB Phase 3 preparation**  
FDA EOP2 meeting arrangement and Phase 3 alignment will be another catalyst paving a path for NDA.

**D) Possible interim report of START.**  
START is an AD treatment phase 2 clinical trial which is designed to meet phase 3 standard. 18 months study with 540 patients, across multiple sites through ACTC (Alzheimer Clinical Trial Consortium - NIA/NIH), randomised, placebo, biomarker, etc.... you name it, it's almost phase 2/3.

START has begun on July 2023 and is already more than halfway through and is expected to end by April 2027. CGTX should have plenty of data by now, and I believe this has played a critical role for FDA agreeing with two short 6 months phase 3 design for AD. CGTX already has FAST TRACK for AD treatment, and START trials have been conducted through all the renowned AD hospitals and most renowned doctors across the US. And ACTC is supported by NIA/NIH. With Fast Track, CGTX would be in close communication with FDA with the progress, and the results would be well known among experts in the field already. It's relatively a close knit community. I strongly believe the results from START have supported FDA making a decision to align with CGTX's phase 3 plan.

If the results are good, CGTX will likely to announce interim report in any given months from now on, and if positive, we will be able to figure out the direction of the Phase 3 outcome.

**E) Partnership Decisions.**  
When you read the PR and watch the interview with Lisa, CEO of CGTX, we can understand that there are already several potential partners with advanced discussions. Considering all the strong results and FDA's alignment with further development of CT1812, CGTX would have a strong leverage in the deal. 

**F) Start of Phase 3**  
Once the partner is decided, phase 3 preparation will speed up. With the recruitment and first patient, another momentum will kick in.

**G) Road to new drugs + buy out**  
This is long-term play, 3 years + once drugs are approved, a huge buyout deal can be expected.

**3) Some risks**  
Funding issue; we all know CGTX lacks cash.
CGTX seems to have tapped the ATM balance in July.
On ER, outstanding stock was 65M or so, and now it is 73M; no need for SEC filing for using the existing limit.
I believe this has helped CGTX to secure  enough cash runway into 2026 Q2. Hopefully, a partnership is found soon.  

However,  various types of funding options are a healthy cycle as long as the valuation of the company moves up through delivering results, that's a whole purpose of going public on the stock market, and win-win for the company and the investors. 

Phase 3 failures - this is a common risk for every clinical trial stage biotech. However, CGTX has multiple potential treatments and will mitigate risk by diversifying portfolio.

**--Conclusion--**

**I am holding my stocks until the true valuation of the company is recognized and considering pros and cons, upward potential is 100x stronger than downward risk, at least until the outcome of phase 3.**

**Big partnership deal is looming. It will be stupid to sell before that.**

**Current price is still a bargain before delisting risk is lifted.**

**I strongly believe you will regret not grabbing this opportunity before it lifts off**

**This has a potential for a long rally with very little imminent risks.**
Monday if it stays above 1 dollar it will regain compliance. That's just one reason. Should've bought the dip Right about now is a good dip Yeh, definitely imo, but do your own research before making any decision. I do not care about daily price movements, I just focus on my primary endpoint. Great write up! Don't worry about the $2.30 price you paid. In a few months, you'll be looking back wishing you had doubled the price at that price, because CGTX has enormous potential ahead of it, potentially rising much higher than $2.30. These are normal market fluctuations. Just for comparison, $SAVA, from the same Alzheimer's sector, went from $3 a few years ago to an incredible $120 (it didn't last long at that price), and it did so extremely quickly because when institutional investors discovered it, there was no way to buy it cheap. So, think about CGTX when institutional investors truly discover the potential of this drug. They will buy heavily and at whatever price it is, because they spare no effort. So, stay calm and stick to your plan to hold your shares. Our friend's post is a scroll of peace of mind and the knowledge that we CGTX investors are on the right track! It's only a matter of time! The hidden gem that is CGTX is yet to be discovered! Stocks never go up forever, there's shake out, stop loss raids,  profit taking,  macro economy, just a normal day. Excellent post and description about CGTX. I read about your post on another Reddit post and other posts from CGTX investors, and this post of yours describes the company's real situation and what are the positive and negative points to study before investing in CGTX. I completely agree with you and have been following CGTX since last year, but in recent weeks, several very good news stories, which you mentioned, have given me more certainty that CGTX really is a company with the potential to appreciate more than 100x. I'm even thinking about increasing my average price a little by buying more shares if there is a drop, but with the next news coming out, it will certainly explode upwards. And even at US$2, it is a very cheap price where we small investors can buy at a significant amount. Those who already have it shouldn't sell to take small profits! Remember what NVIDIA was like a few years ago, it was at $50 in December 2023, and look at it now... It's costing $174.87 (with a 10:1 split), that is, a current price of $1748.87... So CGTX could be the NVIDIA of the ""Alzheimer's sector"". Think about the future, the possibility of splits happening... CGTX has a lot of fuel to burn! So don't sell your shares, get inspired by NVIDIA! Given the other drugs on the market. I would be surprised if CT1812 doesn’t get BTD approval Yeah I agree regaining compliance will help us out a lot, I really think we can hit $20 in the short term assuming we get partnership news and

1mw72em,2025-08-21,"SX / SXOOF
St-Georges Eco-Mining Corp. (SX.CN on the CSE), starring their subsidiary EVSX as the hero who might finally rescue my portfolio from the abyss. 

I’ve been clutching this bag like a bad habit for years, watching “quiet progress” crawl slower than a glacier on vacation, while the share price belly-flops to pennies (currently hovering around 6.5 cents—close enough to a nickel for comedic effect). My friends stage interventions; my therapist bills extra. But I cling to faith: This could rocket, Join my delusion! Confession time: I bought in when EVs were hype, not highway staples. Now, as the world drowns in dead batteries, I’ve endured press releases like slow-drip torture—EVSX tweaks a line! Signs a memo! —while shares erode like my dignity. I’ve aged a few years, muttering, “Patience is a virtue… or a curse.” Portfolio down? Spirits up! (Barely.) 

But let’s pivot to why EVSX isn’t just my Stockholm syndrome. St-Georges is the green mining maverick: Exploring critical minerals in Quebec and Iceland (volcanic hot spots for hot tech), advancing metallurgy and green hydrogen without nuking the planet. But EVSX? That’s the crown jewel, a battery recycling beast turning e-waste into gold. Dive deep: EVSX operates a state-of-the-art facility in Thorold, Ontario—expanded to crush 12,500 tonnes of batteries annually. We’re talking multi-chemistry magic: Lithium-ion (from EVs to gadgets), nickel-cadmium, alkaline, carbon-zinc—you name it, they shred it. No retooling downtime; fully automated, zero-landfill wizardry. 

They hit 87.7% recycling efficiency (top-tier in Canada), recovering critical goodies like lithium, nickel, cobalt, copper, steel, and aluminum at over 93% material efficiency. Black mass? Sorted. Plastics and electrolytes? Repurposed into fertilizers or new batteries. No dumping—pure circular economy bliss. Recent wins I’ve “patiently” observed: In November 2024, they commissioned the full battery line ahead of schedule, appointing new leadership to boot. March 2025? Bam—final environmental compliance approval, green-lighting ops. 

Then the biggie: A three-year supply deal with Call2Recycle Canada, funneling millions of kilos of used batteries (household, commercial, industrial) straight to Thorold. That’s scaling to full capacity, baby! 

Partnerships with OEMs under gov oversight, North American expansion whispers—EVSX is positioning as a recycling powerhouse amid EV boom and subsidy waves. Poke fun? I’m the punchline: Years of holding, share price in the toilet, but EVSX’s tech could send this upwards fast. . 

Governments mandate recycling; demand explodes. St-Georges feeds the beast with minerals, EVSX closes the loop. Not financial advice I have no idea what I’m doing. Good luck all!
I certainly agree, battery recycling tech will be huge in the not so distant future.

1mvkl9f,2025-08-20,"ESGold’s Colombian play—tailings and potential treasure.
Alright, Reddit, buckle up. If you’re the kind who loves a good mining story with a splash of flair, here’s something that caught my eye.

ESGold Corp. (CSE: ESAU | OTCQB: ESAUF | FSE: Z7D) dropped some news. They’ve inked a binding MOU with Colombian outfit Planta Magdalena S.A.S. to reprocess gold‑ and silver‑loaded tailings in Bolívar. Think of it as hunting for treasure where others left scraps—except the “scraps” include assays up to 42.7 g/t Au and silver spikes over 190 g/t Ag. Not too shabby for leftovers.

Here’s the skinny:

* **Money on the table:** ESGold is putting down C$1.5 million for a 50 % slice of the joint venture and locking in a first right to scoop up the rest within a year at a fair market price. It’s all contingent on verifying permits and licences.
* **Due diligence drama:** 27 samples from the tailings have been assayed, revealing some eye‑popping grades. More systematic sampling and metallurgical testing are coming to see if the numbers hold up.
* **Why Bolívar could be a blockbuster:** This region is Colombia’s gold heartland, with artisanal miners chewing through an estimated 300,000 tonnes of ore a year. Much of it gets processed with old‑school mercury methods that leave a lot of gold and silver behind. ES Gold’s pitch is to bring modern, mercury‑free tech to the party, clean up the mess and pocket what others missed—similar to what they’re doing at their Montauban project in Québec. If they stick the landing, this could be a second cash‑flowing operation by 2026.
* **Next on the script:** Finalize a definitive agreement, double‑check the permits, run Qualified Person–supervised site visits, refine the circuit design and keep cranking on Montauban’s build‑out. They’re also working on a 3D geological model to line up future drill targets back in Québec. A lot of pieces need to click before this goes from press release to production.

None of this is a suggestion to buy or sell anything. If you’re contemplating investments, do your own research.
I've been in it just for the Montauban project, if they have two going on, it just shows how scalable this model is.

1mvjr9c,2025-08-20,"Formation Metals – Is This the Undervalued Gem Nobody’s Talking About?
Alright folks, here’s one that’s been flying under the radar: Formation Metals (CSE: FOMO). Tiny cap, multi-metal exposure, and smack in the middle of tier-one mining jurisdictions. Let’s break it down Reddit-style 

**Quebec: N2 Gold Project – The Sleeper Play**

The big story here is their N2 Gold Project in Quebec’s Abitibi belt. If you follow gold, you know this district spits out world-class deposits. N2 covers \~4,400 hectares along the Casa Berardi trend.

* Historical resource: \~870,000 oz gold (yeah, not small potatoes).
* Breakdown:
   * \~18M tonnes @ 1.4–1.5 g/t Au.
   * RJ zone: 243k tonnes @ 7.82 g/t (that’s actually spicy).
* Only one-third of the A-zone drilled. There’s 3km still open—untapped upside just sitting there.
* 20,000m drill campaign is funded and in motion. First 5,000m is already hitting zones “A,” “RJ,” and “Central.”
* They’re also spotting copper and zinc intercepts—so this might not be just a gold story.

Translation: the ground is proven, and they’re finally punching the drills deep enough to matter.

**Ontario: Nicobat – Nickel, Copper, Cobalt**

Over in Ontario, Formation holds 85% of the Nicobat project. This one’s about nickel, copper, cobalt—aka battery metals central.

With nickel demand forecast to double by 2032 (EVs, energy storage, etc.), having a foot in this door is solid. Toss in whispers of titanium and zinc, and you’ve basically got a mini critical-minerals basket.

**Market Context – Perfect Storm?**

* Gold is hanging around all-time highs (\~$3,400/oz). Investors are piling into safe-haven assets as global economic data wobbles, inflation remains sticky, and central banks hesitate on rate cuts. This backdrop is exactly what junior gold explorers dream of, since capital tends to chase growth stories when the metal itself is setting records.
* Nickel market could jump from $37B (2024) to $73B (2032). EV batteries, grid storage, and stainless steel demand are all pulling hard on supply, which means juniors with land packages like Nicobat suddenly look a lot more interesting. If you think EVs are going away, you’re lost.
* Canada + U.S. both screaming about securing domestic supply chains. Translation: explorers like FOMO are finally relevant, since Ottawa and Washington are putting real money and policy behind homegrown critical mineral projects.

**Valuation – Here’s Where It Gets Juicy**

Formation has:

* Working capital: \~C$5.3M (as of August 2025), with zero debt.
* Exploration budget: \~C$5.7M after final financing tranche.
* Market cap: \~C$21.4M (as of August 19, 2025).
* Share price: $0.36.
* 52-week range: $0.09 – $0.425.

Let that sink in. They’re fully funded for the 2025 drill program without raising right now, which is a rare position for a junior at this stage. That means every dollar from here can go into the ground, not into bankers’ pockets. If they grow N2 to 3M oz (not impossible given how under-drilled it is), the in-ground value could push US$9.9B. Even a fraction of that gets priced in and this thing rerates hard. For context, peers with similar resources in the Abitibi have traded at multiples of Formation’s current valuation.

Right now, you’re basically paying pennies for lottery tickets with pretty damn good odds, except these tickets come with defined ounces, infrastructure nearby, and fresh catalysts about to hit the tape.

**What’s New? Mobilization & Full Funding**

On August 7, 2025, Formation announced it has mobilized crews to site at the N2 Gold Project. Roads and drill pads are being prepped, and Phase 1 of their 20,000m program—focused on 10,000m near-term drilling—is locked in. The company also closed the final tranche of financing, increasing its 2025–2026 exploration budget to \~C$5.7M. This ensures they can go full throttle on both expansion drilling at the “A” and “RJ” zones and testing new targets, while still having the flexibility to chase those copper-zinc leads.

**TL;DR – Why FOMO Actually Fits the Name**

* Quebec + Ontario = tier-one jurisdictions 
* N2 gold project = expansion potential with high-grade zones 
* Nicobat = nickel, copper, cobalt exposure 
* Funded drill program = catalysts incoming 
* Dirt-cheap valuation 

This isn’t financial advice, but honestly, if they drop drill results showing serious expansion at N2, the re-rate could be nuts. Definitely one to keep on the watchlist.

So… what do you think? Is FOMO (lol at the ticker) just another junior explorer, or is this the kind of sleeper play that makes legends in the gold/nickel space?

1mvgfuf,2025-08-20,"[DD] ESGold Expands Into Colombia With High-Grade Tailings MOU
**Ticker:** CSE: ESAU | OTCQB: ESAUF | FSE: Z7D

ESGold just signed an MOU to take 50% of a tailings project in Bolívar, Colombia, putting up C$1.5M with the option to grab the other half in the next year. This is the same playbook they’re running at Montauban in Quebec: take abandoned mine dumps that still carry grade, process them cleanly, and generate cash flow without billion-dollar capex.

The numbers in this release are what stand out. Early assays show gold up to **42 g/t** and silver up to **280 g/t**. That’s not background noise, if the metallurgical work holds up, these tailings are closer to a small, high-grade resource than typical waste. Due diligence and circuit design are scheduled for September, with a targeted start in 2026.

**Why this matters:** If Montauban delivers and Colombia checks out, ESGold stops being a single-project junior and starts looking like a tailings roll-up across the Americas. That’s a scalable model in a sector where most juniors burn cash hoping for a discovery. The optionality here is real: low entry cost, high-margin potential, and the ability to replicate.

**Risks:** Selective sampling can be misleading — consistency is key. Colombia brings more jurisdictional complexity than Quebec. And 2026 is ambitious, so execution needs to stay tight.

**Bottom line:** This isn’t just a bolt-on. It’s ESGold showing they want to scale the tailings model internationally. If both Montauban and Colombia run, the valuation math changes fast.

**Link:** [https://www.esgold.com/esgold-signs-mou-for-high-grade-tailings-project-in-colombia/](https://www.esgold.com/esgold-signs-mou-for-high-grade-tailings-project-in-colombia/)
Also forgot to mention a few big things while posting earlier:

1. ESGold’s just confirmed its **ANT (Ambient Noise Tomography) imaging hits 1,200m** deep at Montauban—totally reframing it as a potential district-scale VMS system, not just a tailings reprocessor.
2. A **peer-reviewed university study** just backed the Broken Hill-type structural model, outlining three mechanisms of ore remobilization and confirming hydrothermal lenses and fold- hinge stacking in the subsurface.
3. They also just closed a **C$3.45M oversubscribed placement**, with insiders participating. 46 mystery upvotes

1mtxkpw,2025-08-18,"MBOT (Microbot Medical) – FDA Catalyst Around the Corner
### 1. The Company
Microbot Medical (ticker: MBOT) is a small-cap  medtech company developing the **LIBERTY robotic surgical system**. It’s designed to let surgeons do endovascular procedures (things like catheter-based interventions) with a **single-use, disposable robot**. The big pitch: lower infection risk, lower cross-contamination, and remote-controlled precision. No direct competitors have an FDA-cleared disposable robotic system in this space right now.

---

### 2. FDA Status
- **Dec 2024:** MBOT filed its **510(k) premarket notification** with the FDA.  
- **Timeline:** By law, the FDA is expected to respond within ~180 days, putting the **outer window around June 2025**. We’re already well into Q3, and the company has said publicly that it expects to **commercialize LIBERTY in Q3 2025** → that suggests they are confident clearance is imminent.  
- **Trials:** LIBERTY completed multiple **100% success rate pre-clinical trials** with no adverse events (bench and animal models). These were published/presented and accepted by regulatory agencies as sufficient to support the 510(k) submission. In plain English: the device did what it was supposed to do, every time.  
- **Regulatory risk:** 510(k) is not like a drug NDA; it’s about showing your device is **“substantially equivalent”** to a predicate device. Since LIBERTY is designed around existing catheter techniques, it fits this pathway. Clearance rates for 510(k) devices are historically **very high** (>90%).

---

### 3. Financial Position
- As of the latest Q2 filing (Aug 2025), MBOT had ~**$14M cash**.  
- Burn rate is ~$2.5–3M per quarter → runway is **over 1 year** without needing new capital.  


---

### 4. Market Opportunity
- TAM for endovascular robotic procedures is estimated in the **multi-billion dollar range**. Even a sliver of market penetration would be material for a company with a ~$100M market cap today.  
- LIBERTY being **single-use** is key: recurring revenue model like Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) but applied to vascular robotics.

---

### 5. Trading Setup
- Current price: ~$3.08 (Aug 18 close).  
- Short interest ~20% of float (per ORTEX data).  
- FDA clearance news is a binary event. Approval → stock could **gap hard** (historically 100–300%+ moves in small medtechs on clearance day).  
- Risk: If clearance is delayed or additional data requested, price likely drifts back toward $2.50–2.80.

---

### 6. My Take
- MBOT is **de-risked on the science side** (trials all passed, predicate device pathway clear).  
- The company itself has telegraphed that **commercial launch is expected this quarter**, which implies clearance should be right around the corner.  
- In my view, it’s one of the cleaner binary FDA setups in the microcap biotech/medtech space right now.  

---

**TL;DR** – MBOT submitted its 510(k) in Dec 2024, all trials had 100% success, FDA clearance is overdue/likely imminent, and management says commercialization is coming in Q3. Current ~$100M cap could re-rate sharply if LIBERTY gets the green light.
I agree with this. The FDA approval will help this stock to rise, but the Q4 results are going to make the real difference Bought in last week and holding til this plays out. Nothing big, couple hundred shares. I bought in a couple of weeks ago.  Surgeons have strong influence in FDA decisions.  This device will free the surgeon and everyone else present in the operating room from having to wear heavy lead aprons during surgery. Nobody concerned that the price of approval is already priced in? $3 isn’t justified from current ER Same why would they reverse split ? Literally nanobots.
Single use is a good thing in surgery despite the waste - sterility and no risk of cross contamination You’re concerned about the environment and sustainability, with this goverment? I work in a global pharmaceutical company and we throw away all types of tech and nasty things it simply gets recycled or landfill once it leaves the site it’s got nothing to do with us, just how MBOT manufacturing and selling them will advise but doesn’t have a say in disposal Yes, but the surgeon is operating remotely from the cath lab control room. I can’t find a picture of the system setup in the OR - what I can find from their website shows the device controls on a sterile field with surgical instruments, which seems to contradict what you said somewhat.

# 📉 Why The Recent Price Drop Was Pure Mechanics (And Why I Loaded Up)

# Let's address the elephant in the room - the brutal drop to $0.17 (~$55M market cap):

# What Actually Caused The Selling Panic:

**🏠 Estate Liquidation: \~5M shares dumped from retired director's estate** \- pure mechanical selling, zero fundamental reason

**💰 A/R Financing: Temporary receivables pressure required minimal equity raise** (<2% dilution vs. 15-20% typical for growing biotechs)

**⏰ Timing Delays Created FUD:**

* **AEC Stockholm install:** Delayed nearly a year due to building permits (now resolved, going live September 2025)
* **Clyra ""Gorilla"" reveal:** Pushed from Q1 2025 to Q1 2026 due to NDA requirements
* **Market punishment: Investors hate delays, even when they're regulatory/legal, not technical**

# The POOPH Revenue Story (The Real Catalyst For Panic):

Here's what actually happened - and why it's BULLISH long-term:

**POOPH was crushing the pet odor market** so hard that Reckitt Benckiser (owner of Resolve) filed a complaint with the National Advertising Division (NAD) in mid-2024, challenging POOPH's advertising claims.

***Translation: POOPH was taking so much market share that the incumbent giant had to lawyer up to slow them down.***

# Why Revenues Temporarily Dropped:

* **Forced advertising halt:** Popular TV commercials stopped airing during NAD review
* **Marketing reorganization:** Required compliance changes disrupted the growth trajectory
* **Temporary market confusion:** Customers didn't understand the product changes

# The Comeback Story:

* New compliant campaigns launched Q3 2025: Ads back on air, +30,000 new retail locations added
* A/R issues resolved: Cash flow bottlenecks cleared
* Early Q4 signs: Sales trending higher again as regroup phase ends
* Validation of product-market fit: When competitors lawyer up, you know you're winning

**Why Smart Money Loaded Up:**

# 🎯 Perfect Storm of Overreaction:

* Estate selling + POOPH narrative + AEC delays = out-of-proportion panic
* Nothing changed about the core tech, partnerships, or billion-dollar opportunities
* Share count impact minimal, fundamentals at all-time highs

# 💪 Insider Response:

* **Management and long-term holders (including me) bought aggressively**
* **I personally added 125K shares** \- putting my money where my conviction is
* **Insiders exercising warrants at $0.25** 

# ⏰ Timing Advantage:

* **Price weakness coincided with major team additions (50+ employees) and manufacturing scale-up**
* **All catalysts still on track, just slightly delayed - but now at fire-sale prices**

# The Bottom Line:

When Reckitt Benckiser has to sue to slow you down, that's not a red flag - **that's validation you're disrupting a massive market.**

**The selling was pure mechanics (estate + delays + temporary marketing hiccup)**, while the fundamental story got stronger with validated manufacturing, dream team hires, and regulatory progress.

***This is exactly the kind of disconnect that creates generational buying opportunities.***

**Bottom line: $0.17 represents a 60% discount to where smart money was buying just 6 months ago.**

# 🏭 Commercial Infrastructure: Ready to Scale

**Manufacturing & Distribution:**

* ✅ 2 million units/year capacity at pharmaceutical-grade facility (partner invested millions also)
* ✅ FDA 510(k) clearance for wound irrigation (platform for expansion)
* ✅ Quality systems validated for commercial scale
* ✅ Distribution deals covering 14,600+ U.S. healthcare facilities

# The ""Gorilla"" Partner Revelation:

**From recent shareholder meeting:**

* **Top-4 global medtech company** (>$100B market cap) signed as distributor
* **Multiple products in development** beyond just ViaCLYR
* **Co-branded launches planned for Q1/Q2 2026**
* **15-person partner teams in meetings** \- treating Clyra as peer, not vendor

This isn't some regional distributor. This is Fortune 500 validation.

# 💰 Revenue Projections That Should Excite Growth Investors

**Conservative 12-Month Scenario :**

* **400 surgeons using ViaCLYR** (out of 27,800 U.S. orthopedic surgeons)
* **$6,000/month per surgeon** (based on 20 procedures × $15/liter × 2L average\*)
* **$2.4M monthly = $28.8M annual Clyra revenue**
* **BioLargo's 52% stake = $15M annual contribution**
* This would represent **84% of BioLargo's current total revenue from ONE product** (based on BioLargo's 2024 revenue of $17.77M)

**Aggressive Scale Scenario (3-5 Years):**

* **4,000+ surgeons** adoption (still <14% market penetration)
* **$288M+ annual Clyra revenue**
* **$150M+ annual BLGO contribution**
* **30x medtech multiple = $2.25B valuation impact**

**And that's just orthopedic surgery. Add burns, chronic wounds, dental, military, aesthetics...**



# 🔬 The Broader BioLargo Portfolio (Why This Isn't One-Trick)

**Beyond Clyra, BLGO targets three additional trillion-dollar markets:**

# 1. PFAS Water Treatment (AEC):

* **$200M+ project pipeline including Fortune 500 industrials**
* **>99% PFAS removal at 80% lower lifecycle cost vs. carbon systems**
* **First commercial installation going live** September/October 2025 (EPA pilot status)

# 2. Cellinity Battery Technology:

* **4 signed MOUs** for partner-funded factories
* **$500M/year revenue per factory** \- BLGO earns 16% + royalties
* **Third-party validated:** 500Wh/kg, 20+ year life, fire-proof

# 3. Pooph Consumer Products:

* **40,000+ retail locations** with national advertising relaunch
* **6% gross revenue + manufacturing margin - no CapEx required**
* **20% of exit** value if brand gets acquired

# 4. Engineering Services (BLEST):

* **Air Force contracts across 8+ bases**
* **517%  increased engineering segment revenue**  New engineering contracts to provide air quality control compliance services
* **Employees providing recurring government validation**

# 📊 Why The Math Works: Sum-of-Parts Analysis

**Conservative Enterprise Value Targets (Management Guidance):**

* **Clyra Medical:** $500M+ (wound care platform)
* **PFAS/AEC:** $1B+ (water treatment crisis)
* **Cellinity:** $2B+ (grid storage revolution)
* **Pooph + Engineering:** $500M+ (licensing + services)

**Total: $4B+ enterprise value vs. $55M current market cap**

**Even if management hits 25% of targets = 18x return from current levels.**

***BioLargo's convergence moment—multiple billion-dollar verticals hitting commercial inflection simultaneously.***



# 🎯 My Position & Conviction (Skin in the Game)

**Current Holdings:** 1.25%+ of outstanding shares, high six-figure investment

**Average Cost**: $0.12-$0.37 range (adding every dip under $0.25)

**Target Timeline:** 12-36 months for major revaluation

**Why I'm Not Selling:**

* **Technology superiority validated by FDA and clinical studies**
* **World-class team finally assembled for commercial execution**
* **Market timing perfect with antibiotic resistance crisis**
* **Financial position approaching profitability with minimal dilution**
* **Multiple shots on goal - not dependent on single product success**

# 

# ⚠️ Risk Assessment (Being Realistic)

# Potential Headwinds:

* **Adoption curve** may be slower than projected in conservative healthcare
* **Reimbursement hurdles** in certain care settings
* **Competitive response** from entrenched players with deep pockets
* **Regulatory expansion costs** for new indication

# Mitigation Factors:

* **Multiple distribution channels** reduce single-point-of-failure risk
* **Superior clinical profile** creates compelling switching rationale
* **Cost-neutral pricing** removes budget objections
* **Platform technology** enables rapid expansion across indications
* **Experienced team** has navigated these challenges before

# 

# 🚀 Final Conviction: Why This Is My Next EXAS

**Seven years ago, skeptics called Exact Sciences ""just another biotech story.""** **""Look at your opportunity cost"",** those same skeptics are silent as EXAS revolutionized cancer screening.

**Clyra Medical has the same ingredients:**

* ✅ Game-changing technology solving massive clinical problems
* ✅ FDA validation removing regulatory uncertainty
* ✅ World-class team with proven commercialization track records
* ✅ Distribution partnerships providing immediate market access
* ✅ Market timing coinciding with urgent medical needs

**The difference? Clyra is trading at a fraction of early-stage EXAS valuation.**

**Dennis Calvert's confidence that ""all shots on goal will hit the net"" isn't CEO hyperbole - it's based on 7+ years of R&D, manufacturing scale-up, team building, and partnership development finally reaching commercial fruition.**

**At $0.17 with Clyra launching, BLGO represents the asymmetric opportunity of a lifetime.**

# 💎 Purpose-Driven Investing: More Than Just Returns

* This isn't just about portfolio gains - it's about funding innovation that saves lives. Every ViaCLYR irrigation prevents infections. Every PFAS cleanup protects communities. Every Cellinity battery enables renewable energy.

**Your investment dollars become research funding, manufacturing capacity, and global distribution that makes the world better.**

Call me a dreamer, but I'd rather bet on companies solving trillion-dollar problems than trading memes.

Despite the overall market’s cautious stance, **that very skepticism opens up a rare opportunity.** 

The gap between what’s perceived and what’s actually happening couldn’t be clearer—and savvy investors who spot this early are positioning themselves for substantial upside. 

In fact, word is circulating about a prominent, well-funded investor with a large following who is actively building a meaningful stake—aiming for 5 to 10 million shares—well ahead of the broader market’s realization. **The signs are unmistakable  BLGO’s commercial breakthrough is likely just months away, not years.** 

**This is the time when strong conviction can truly pay dividends.**

*Not financial advice - I'm a filmmaker who studies biotech, not a licensed advisor. Do your own research. I'm a substantial long-term holder who's lived through every up and down with this company.*

**Position: SUBSTANTIAL LONG**

**Conviction: MAXIMUM**

**Strategy: ADDING ON WEAKNESS**

**Timeline: 12-36 MONTHS (I will be here until the whole success story will have unfolded and everything below 20X long term would be a disappointment)** 

***Let's see who's calling me a ""bag-holder"" when Clyra revenues start printing and that ""gorilla"" partner gets announced...***

🎬🏥💉🚀

**Your Turn: Prove Me Wrong (Or Right)**

I've spent hundreds of hours researching Clyra Medical and BioLargo, put my money where my conviction is—but **I don't want echo chambers, I want smart analysis.**

Challenge my thesis. Dig into the SEC filings I referenced. Call BioLargo investor relations with your questions. Look up the copper-iodine patents, research the wound care market data, verify the clinical studies I cited. **The best DD comes from collaborative skepticism and shared research.**

**This is your opportunity to either find the holes in my analysis or discover why Wall Street might be sleeping on a medical device revolution.** The clinical data is published, the patents are public, the market sizes are verifiable.

**Let's crowdsource this DD and make each other better investors.** I've shown you mine—now show me where I'm wrong, or help me understand why a $55M company with FDA-cleared tech and Fortune 500 distribution partners might actually be the steal of 2025.

The data is all there. Let's dig deeper together. 🔬📊

I read what you wrote, and it sounds very tempting. 

What do you think about the reverse split? As I understand it correctly, at the end of June they approved that they can carry out a 10-for-1 reverse split if they want to get on Nasdaq or NYSE? They can do it, but at the moment it’s not planned. Doesn’t that cause concern, or does it not really matter in the bigger picture? Not AI 🙂 I put together a 20-page DD on this myself. English isn’t my first language, so I polished the writing a bit for clarity — but the research and content are fully mine. Thanks for thinking it’s chatbot-level smoothness though! BLGO is the stock in question correct ? It doesn't show up in SoFi Invest. Great write-up as usual, thank you.

My understanding is NASDAQ requires a $4 minimum so they need to reach $0.40 or approx a $115M MC without further dilution.

My recommendation is that they wait till the share price is $0.50 with a growth trajectory story underway in order to list at $5 to get out of penny stock status and thereby attract institutional investors. 

I know they need cash as they have ramped up their employee count for the Clyra rollout. So, Clyra, Pooph, and NRE, need to be able to pay all the bills and give them a growing profit for two consecutive quarters minimum and earn that $150M MC (assuming no further dilution) while on OTCX. 

The then-current growth projections will then dictate how high the share price will rise and stabilize at, post- NASDAQ listing—and help dissuade short-sellers from taking an interest and pushing the share price down below $5. Real nice DD write-up.  This thorough review hits all the burning hot key-points.  
BLGO is ridiculously undervalued.  
I wish it had several institutional analysts to follow it.  But, that will come sooner than later.  
But, my bet is that BLGO will show some significant revenue and news before 2026.  
I am still loading up aggressively on my personal stock holdings, which total just over 4 million shares.  
Readers will be kicking themselves when this stock breaks $1 per share and they could have had an 80% higher return if they collected shares now.

Read this article one more time, there is a lot here to absorb.  Go BLGO. Wow great job on this! Your passion for this investment is very clear and commendable (you’re included in practically every search result for BLGO on Reddit). 

I am currently on the hunt for a new “swing for the fences” opportunity with about 200k to potentially deploy, and I’m intrigued by BioLargo. A few questions for you:

How much cash does BLGO currently have on hand, and what is their burn rate?  What percentage of that burn rate is going to executive compensation?

What percentage of shares are owned by insiders (not options, but actual shares bought on the open market)?

They are certainly not opposed to diluting current shareholders to raise more cash; what indicators exist to suggest that dilution is nearly over? (I see that new-issued shares has declined YOY for the past five years, but am looking more for business catalysts)

How does the current political landscape (rolling back renewable focus, precious metal economics, etc.) affect BioLargo’s forecasts?

And finally, I see you’ve been championing them hard for several years… when the stock popped to 35c in spring 2024, you must have been very excited. Did you think that was the beginning of greatness? How did you mentally cope with the return back to current levels? Only available over the counter (OTC).

How do I buy stocks like this?

1mtkkon,2025-08-18,"HUGE NEWS: ARRNF Begins Test Mining at Cowboy State Mine
This is a critical milestone that pushes ARRNF closer to production and validates the project in a very real, tangible way.

**Highlights from today’s announcement:**

* First blast completed safely
* Excavation of weathered material already underway
* Bulk sample program started, ore being stockpiled for processing optimization & demo plant feed
* \~3,200 tonnes of ore will be extracted for the demonstration plant (7 million pounds)
* Data collection on drilling/blasting/fragmentation to guide full-scale mine design

This isn’t just exploration drilling anymore, this is real mining activity, real ore on the ground, and the beginning of showing ARRNF’s process at scale.

This is the kind of milestone that can fly under the radar if we don’t talk about it, so let’s get the word out and make sure the community knows just how big this step really is.

1mtjzzw,2025-08-18,"🚨 PSTV – Positive Clinical Results Just Dropped 🚨
Plus Therapeutics ($PSTV) presented updated Phase 1/2 data from the ReSPECT-LM trial of REYOBIQ™ (rhenium-186 obisbemeda) in leptomeningeal metastases (LM) — a devastating complication of brain and spinal cancers with virtually no good treatment options.

Key takeaways:
	•	Safety confirmed – intrathecal delivery was well-tolerated, no dose-limiting toxicities.
	•	Clear efficacy signal – CSF tumor DNA levels fell, MRI responses observed, and several patients showed meaningful clinical benefit.
	•	First-of-its-kind approach – liquid radiation directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, designed to precisely target LM while sparing healthy tissue.
	•	High-need indication – thousands of patients per year in the U.S. with virtually no approved therapies.

👉 Why it matters: PSTV isn’t just another small-cap biotech. They’re advancing a platform radiotherapeutic technology that could disrupt how we treat hard-to-reach CNS cancers. With FDA guidance leaning toward “test + treat” models in CNS disease, this dataset is a serious credibility boost.

💡 If this program advances successfully, it could position PSTV as a first mover in LM therapy — an area where Big Pharma has failed repeatedly.

I usually sell when I'm -20% and buy more when it goes up Promising. Phase 2 will be a revised dosage of 44.10 mCi, while phase 1 was a mix of patients receiving 6.6 mCi, 13.2 mCi, 26.4 mCi, 44.10 mCi, 66.14 mCi, or 75mCi. here's hoping the lower doses brought down the success rate and 44.10 is the sweet spot for success and minimal side effects.

  
I chose this as my next stock because it has a real, immediate opportunity to significantly help people. there are real people suffering in these trials, and I hope my investment can keep this company operating to help them and so many others in the future. not sure when this can ever pop honestly, but with a profitable Q2, I'm in for at least a year or two and not too worried with such a low average SP. if it goes to $5 or $7, I can pay off some debts and get a new car. Nice, down 14%. Guess it’s time to buy now. “Bot or bagholder?” is like reddit’s shittiest party game I have a lot and I usually sell when I’m up 20% or so each time then buy dips repeat Solid trading strategy! Some of my best plays have been picking stocks that people are so against. Since taking office this spring, Commissioner, Dr. Marty Makary,^(5) and Chief Medical and Scientific Officer, Dr. Vinay Prasad,^(6) have stressed the urgency of modernizing the FDA (Federal Drug Administration) by partnering with innovators, streamlining regulatory pathways, boosting efficiency with tools like generative AI,^(7) and approving rare disease drugs at the first sign of promise.^(8)

Last week offered important evidence that the FDA is delivering results, as it granted full approval to Precigen’s adenoviral-vector immunotherapy, Papzimeos. The therapy treats recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, a rare disease with no prior approved therapies that has forced patients into repeated surgeries^(9) for relief.

In our view, the approval of Papzimeos is a landmark—not only for patients but also for other rare disease drugs in development. Notably, the FDA approved Papzimeos based on a single-arm, 35-patient cohort in a Phase 1/2^(10) study. While patients enrolled in the study had undergone at least 3 surgeries per year, the Phase 1/2 data demonstrated that, after only four injections of Papzimeos, roughly half of them were surgery-free after 12 months.^(11)

Precigen had filed for accelerated approval and had started a confirmatory trial—the post-marketing study that the FDA typically requires—to verify Panzimeos’ benefit. The new FDA issued full approval on the 35-patient cohort, rendering the confirmatory trial unnecessary.^(12)

In our view, this decision represents an inflection point in the FDA’s evaluation of rare disease therapies. Prasad highlighted that randomized trials are not always necessary,^(16) and that this approval is right-sizing evidence and design relative to the prevalence of the disease. Without sacrificing rigor, this landmark approval is pro-innovation, likely the first in a series that will reflect more tailored regulatory decisions that accelerate therapies for patients facing rare diseases with significant unmet needs.

1msyi8i,2025-08-17,"USAS Institutional Buying
Over the past year or so Institutions have slowly been accumulating shares , and lately on a much bigger & higher clip .  Most the buying in Q1 is by none other than legendary mining billionaire Eric Sprott . That in itself is a huge vote of confidence in this junior miner turn around story .

Another nice nugget , they actually have Antimony . But never mined for it, as it was unprofitable , (lower concentrates)   

But they've done some recent drilling, and hit higher grade % pockets . That along with modern day equipment and advancements in processing could potentially bring in another untapped Revenue stream. 

This is more a play on Silver than it is Gold . I believe they were aiming for 80% of the profits to generate from said metal by end of year .

1msnqb2,2025-08-17,"Why $PGEN has significant upside following FDA approval
# DD: Why $PGEN has significant upside following FDA approval

**Current Price: $2.86 | Market Cap: \~$876M | Analyst PT: $6.00-$8.50**

Precigen presents a compelling investment opportunity following the FDA's approval on Friday. Here's the fundamental case:

# The Monopoly Asset

PAPZIMEOS received full FDA approval for Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis - the first and only treatment for a disease affecting 27,000 adults in the US. This creates a monopoly position in a captive patient population.

# Market Opportunity vs Current Valuation

**Revenue Potential:**

* 27,000 patients in the US alone
* Current standard of care: repeated surgeries costing $15K-30K+ each
* At $100K annual treatment cost = $2.7B total addressable market
* 30% market share at steady state = $810M annual revenue
* Apply 3-4x revenue multiple = $2.4B-3.2B market cap
* **Current market cap: $876M**

**Upside potential: 3-4x** on conservative assumptions for a drug with zero competition.

**My target:** Based on the monopoly positioning and revenue potential, I estimate a fair value of around a $3.5B market cap, which translates to approximately $11.44 per share - roughly 4x from current levels.

# Investment Highlights

**Institutional Backing:** 66% institutional ownership provides validation and stability.

**Analyst Coverage:**

* HC Wainwright raised PT to $8.50 (197% upside from current levels)
* JPMorgan upgraded from Underweight to Neutral
* Median PT of $6.00-7.25 vs current $2.86

**Clinical Validation:** 51% complete response rate with durable 24+ month follow-up demonstrates strong efficacy in a rare disease setting.

**Platform Value:** AdenoVerse technology has applications beyond RRP, providing optionality across gene therapy applications.

**Acquisition Thesis**

Looking at the fundamentals, this has clear acquisition potential:

**Management Pedigree:** Executive Chairman Randal Kirk has a proven track record of biotech exits to big pharma.

**Strategic Positioning:** The Management team has extensive big pharma connections, with Merck on the capitalisation table, providing strategic validation.

**Acquisition Logic:**

* First-in-class monopoly asset
* $1B+ peak sales potential in a defined market
* Market cap size makes it accessible for any major pharma
* Fits perfectly into rare disease portfolios

# Investment Dynamics

**Current Positioning:**

* The biotech sector is receiving renewed attention
* Recent financing provides a runway for execution
* First commercial launch creates new value inflexion
* Small-cap biotech with institutional accumulation

# Revenue Analysis

**Commercial Timeline:**

* Drug launches Q4 2025/Q1 2026
* Peak penetration 5-7 years out
* Monopoly pricing power in a rare disease
* Recurring revenue model for chronic condition

**Comparable Valuations:** Recent rare disease transactions for context:

* Horizon Pharma: Acquired for $27B (multiple rare disease franchises)
* Alexion: Acquired for $175B (PNH franchise) - not expecting this level for PGEN
* Sarepta: $8B+ market cap (DMD portfolio)

By no means do I think $PGEN will reach Alexion's $175B valuation, but these show how the market values monopoly rare disease assets.

# Upcoming Catalysts & Bullish Week Ahead

**This Week's Expectations:**

* Monday shareholder call (conference call where management discusses the approval and commercial strategy) should provide key details
* Expecting continued momentum as institutional buyers participate
* Acquisition speculation is likely to develop given the approved asset + management connections

**Near-term (0-6 months):**

* Commercial launch execution updates
* Initial prescriber adoption data
* Potential partnership/licensing discussions (or acquisition talks)

**Medium-term (6-18 months):**

* Quarterly revenue ramp reporting
* International expansion opportunities
* Pipeline advancement with a validated platform

# Upside Scenarios:

* Monopoly economics in a defined patient population
* Platform expansion across gene therapy applications
* Acquisition premium reflecting rare disease asset value

# Investment Conclusion

PAPZIMEOS approval creates a commercial rare disease asset with monopoly characteristics. The revenue potential supports significantly higher valuations, while the acquisition profile appeals to strategic buyers.

The 94% stock price surge on approval brought attention to the opportunity. The next phase involves either organic revenue development or strategic transaction recognition.

**Position:** Long $PGEN shares, expecting bullish momentum this week post-Monday conference call. **Price targets:** $4-5 on commercial execution, $11+ on full valuation recognition. **Timeline:** 6-18 months for thesis to develop

Strong fundamentals, monopoly positioning, and dual-path value creation make this a compelling biotech opportunity.

**Disclosure:** I am long on $PGEN shares. This is not financial advice - conduct your own research.
Why would they dilute with this stock price, they aren’t diluting anything. Going up LLM's having a field day with these stock analysis prompts. It's already up $0.05 overnight ;) Too late to jump in? Current PGEN treatment cost is $460,000 (4 vials for $115,000 per vial). They also will qualify for orphan drug protection which means no one can market another form of treatment for 7 years. If only 1/3 of patients receive the treatment, that’s 9,000 patients x $460,000. (This does not include ex-us markets.) The rollout begins in approximately 3 weeks. What do you mean fellow regard?

1msccaz,2025-08-17,"PSTV: NCCN Laid Out the Carpet and Set the Stage - Surprise Profit, Strong Data, Texas Launch and Nasdaq Compliance Without Split 🚀
1) NCCN Laid Out the Carpet (June 2025).
In June, NCCN updated guidelines to include the exact CSF-tDNA testing method PSTV’s CNSide delivers. That was the red carpet moment. The stage is already set for the Test + Treat model.

2) Q2 Earnings: Shock Upside.
Analysts expected a loss of –$0.09/share. PSTV reported a profit of +$0.02/share. That’s a swing of $0.11/share — rare for a small-cap biotech.
	•	Cash & investments: $6.9M (vs $3.6M YE 2024)
	•	Revenue: $1.4M
	•	Operating loss: narrowed sharply YoY (–$1.5M vs –$3.7M)
	•	Stockholders’ equity: $3.0M

Instead of bleeding deeper, PSTV flipped to profit and strengthened its balance sheet.

3) Already Nasdaq Compliant — No Split Required.
Here’s the kicker: Nasdaq’s Rule 5550(b)(1) requires ≥ $2.5M stockholders’ equity. PSTV reported $3.0M as of June 30, 2025. That means:
	•	They’re already in Nasdaq compliance.
	•	A reverse split is not required to stay listed.
	•	The split authorization (1-for-2 to 1-for-250) is just a tool in the back pocket — not execution.

This wipes out one of the shorts’ biggest scare tactics.

4) First Presentation Results (Aug 14).
At the CNS Metastases Conference, CNSide showed:
	•	67% detection of tumor cells across 613 assays
	•	>90% clinical management impact
	•	2.8× higher sensitivity vs cytology

Real-world validation, aligned perfectly with NCCN’s guidelines.

5) Second Presentation (ReSPECT-LM).
Next catalyst: oral presentation of REYOBIQ Phase 1 dose-escalation results. Safety + efficacy signals could reinforce the Test + Treat loop in LM. (Results coming in this Monday, stay tuned) 

6) Commercialization.
CNSide launches in Texas this month (Aug 2025), starting with NCI-Designated Cancer Centers, with rollout planned over the next 12 months. Execution is underway.

7) 33M Shares = Structured, Not a Dump.
	•	$50M equity line with Lincoln Park Capital
	•	33M shares registered for resale by LPC
	•	PSTV decides when/if to sell shares into LPC
	•	LPC capped at 4.99% ownership
	•	Shareholders approved exceeding the 19.99% cap on Aug 7
	•	This is financing flexibility! 


The Investment Case:
	•	NCCN staged the way in June.
	•	Q2 crushed expectations (–$0.09 vs +$0.02).
	•	Already Nasdaq compliant with $3.0M equity - no split required.
	•	First presentation strong.
	•	Second catalyst imminent.
	•	Texas launch underway.
	•	Financing is structured and controlled.

TL;DR: NCCN laid out the carpet and set the stage. PSTV shocked with a profit vs an expected loss. Already Nasdaq compliant without needing a split. First CNSide data strong. Second presentation coming. Texas launch started. 33M shares = structured equity line. Shorts’ narratives are broken. 🚀🔥



Interesting, what about **Rule 5550(a)(1/2)** ? And a deadline of September 9? Surely it’s all covered right? Thanks for answering I couldn’t agree more that complies with **5550(b)(1)**  

However I asked about the second part of the listing rule of **5550(a)(1/2)** . Chat GTP probably got confused with the two when you asked him. But it still needs to comply with the rule by September 9 or be delisted, and it needs to issue 10 day warning. Must comply to all rules. Sounding RS. They haven’t even filed for such a split to happen so  there is 0% chance of that being effective as of the 15Th. Just saying! Until I see a news from PSTV, it’s just noise! Results from second presentation should be interesting I bought shares last week and it immediately fell ten percent. Not that I was expecting instant pumps but instant dumps are disconcerting. 50k at 75 cents. Yes ouch! lol but it doesn’t fizz me at all. I don’t even think about it. I’m in it for the story and upcoming catalysts. Day to day SP means nothing! But that’s me. To each his own No you are getting it wrong. Dollar rule is not included in the 3 requirements you mentioned. It's a different compliance condition. Good Job! ready 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Since taking office this spring, Commissioner, Dr. Marty Makary,^(5) and Chief Medical and Scientific Officer, Dr. Vinay Prasad,^(6) have stressed the urgency of modernizing the FDA (Federal Drug Administration) by partnering with innovators, streamlining regulatory pathways, boosting efficiency with tools like generative AI,^(7) and approving rare disease drugs at the first sign of promise.^(8)

1mr6o9s,2025-08-15,"OneMeta AI (ONEI) Just Posted a Major Increase
I posted about OneMeta AI a couple months ago and I hope some people saw it and took advantage. They just posted a 441% increase from Q1 2025. It is still definitely early for the company with many hurdles to cross, but their recent partnerships with Accenture (largest consulting firm globally) and the LDS church are a strong step in the right direction for implementing their solutions. The stock jumped about 80% yesterday.  


It looks like they need to streamline their sales cycle to be able to onboard more clients more efficiently. With the revenue coming in, they should be able to grow their team and get deal closers in the door who can grow their partner integrations.

1mr2vjs,2025-08-15,"$ENLV Enlivex Therapeutics presenting positive arthritis treatment data on Monday 08/18
All preliminary clinical indicators point to positive Phase IIa topline results for their proprietary cell-reprogramming immunotherapy Osteoarthritis drug 'Allocetra'.

Notable outcomes in a 6 month knee Osteoarthritis study of 134 patients yielded a 47% reduction in pain, 46% improvement in joint function and a 40% decrease in stiffness without major side effects.

The Osteoarthritis treatment market is massively undervalued - affecting over 30 million Americans and 300 million people worldwide. This is a growing market - 70+ million Americans are expected to develop a form of osteoarthritis by 2040. The market has an estimated potential $20+ billion by that time.

There are currently no approved drugs that treat osteoarhtritis progression - which is what Enlivex is trying to accomplish.

The beauty of 'Allocetra' is that it's off-the-shelf (produced to be readily available) and easily scalable according to the Enlivex team. 

There is also a secured partnership with a little company called Pfizer. 

The current market cap is ~$43 million trading at ~$1.80 per share with a low float of 22.7 million.

Meeting is scheduled for pre-market 8-9 AM ET this coming Monday 08/18. 


TL;DR:
Enlivex’s off-the-shelf OA therapy Allocetra showed strong Phase IIa results — 47% less pain, 46% better function, 40% less stiffness, no major side effects in a 134-patient, 6-month knee OA trial. With no approved drugs that slow OA progression, this $20B+ future market is wide open. Backed by a Pfizer partnership, Enlivex trades at a ~$43M market cap. Topline results webinar: Mon, Aug 18, pre-market (8–9 AM ET).

1mr1gh2,2025-08-15,"ELTP Stock Price - Aug 2023 - Up 300% / Aug 2024 - Up 300% / Aug 2025 - Up ????
Massive earnings released. Profits up 462% and Revenues up 116%. The Q1 revenues are already at 50% of last year's record breaking revenues.

I made 2 guaranteed calls in this post back in June or I said I would accept a permaban if I was wrong. Both were correct that the earnings for both of the last earnings would be record breakers.

I've always said, people are evaluating this company on yesterday's revenues and that is why I think I was able to find this gem so early. The numbers were always there if you just looked at what they were building. In case you don't know much about this company, here is what this company has been up to for the last few years: dodged everyone else getting taken down during the Oxy lawsuits, shifted over to a few safer generic drugs, bet big on themselves that they could do a better job of selling instead of partnering with multi billion dollar behemoths, bought their own building, leased another 90k sq ft across the street and got a new manufacturing facility FDA approved. Smart businessmen will say that sometimes successful businesses know that sometimes it's important to survive. That's one of the smartest things I think the CEO did here. He hunkered down to survive while everyone else got sued into oblivion. Then, when he knew it was time to thrive, he went all in and bet on the company. Loaning them millions of dollars, and not only did they accomplish all of the above - they also just got another generic ANDA approved in November with a 3.5 Billion market size.

You can see here, that directly after both of the last August earnings calls, ELTP began to skyrocket. It's not surprising. This company has been smashing through expectations. It's the little engine that could.

https://preview.redd.it/lm9mkh71e7jf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0958fc1e8c89f9613b8c1618e979482fead385f

At the height of my investment, I've had as much as $1.1 million invested in this company, and still hold almost 7 million shares. So, where do I think this goes from here? I said it would hit 80 cents to $1 after last earnings - it hit 81 cents. I said back then, that it would hit $1 to $1.20 after the August earnings call. But I didn't expect 462% profit growth. I think this hits $1.15 to $1.60 over the next 75 days. Will it pull back after that? Probably. This is a small company that lacks the volume of a stock on a major exchange, but I'm not in it for the short game. This was, and always will be, a long haul waiting for the buyout that the CEO stated he expects to happen before Aug 2026. A three phase process that the CEO stated phase 2 (picking the Investment Banker to facilitate the M&A) will happen in the next 75 days.

Oh, and one last tidbit for you all. Just an Easter Egg, that, if my theory is correct, should be released Friday or Monday. The first large investment firm bought a small amount of shares 89 days ago. Could it have been an accident? Sure - a $10 billion company could have accident bought $2500 worth of ELTP...or, it could be a smart way for them to disclose interest in the company for legal reasons, and they might have been acquiring more shares in between disclosure periods. That 90th day when they should be reporting is August 15th. Ancor Capital....Oh and what do you know. Their specialty is helping small companies take it to the next level.

Earnings call 11:30am EST - Aug 15th if you want to listen in.
just got off call. They have been working on M&A since fall of 2024. They are out for sale, and if an acquisition doesn't happen by Q1 for 2026 they will move on to option #2 uplifting, but while still working on acquisition. I'm in for a few thousand $ ! But dude how on earth did you dig up this stock?...i looked at your post history and you been going at it for 5 years. Kudos to you! This guy actually initially introduced me to the stock and I was initially pissed off as it declined after earnings 

But I’m now in for the long haul Small D energy. I’ve held for 4.5 years. Up millions. Anyways, I’ll take a latte and a blueberry scone, please. Tremendous if correct

Many M&A rumours swirling, long term but possible highly rewarding payoff

(Disclosure that ELTP is 90% of my portfolio) It’s the competent, unsexy secretary of stocks, so far. All the fundamentals are there. I loved the earnings call and report, and I am long. We may be waiting for a time, but I’m patient. https://www.reddit.com/r/ELTP_Stock/s/H6SduVUTfC

1mqtqzg,2025-08-15,"$WULF (below $5 in past 14 days)... 3B Market Cap.. Google deal worth $3B-$8B in revenue.
$WULF currently has a market cap of only $3B

Google is taking an 8% stake in the company.. and backing a deal worth between $3-$8Billion in Revenue... with caught the 30% Short Float off guard (which now must cover).

Additionally, WULF is hovering over a major technical breakout point.

WULF was already an early leader among mining companies transitioning to the DATA/ AI Business... and will be further propelled now that they have Google's stamp of approval.
Picked up some options yesterday based on this news. With 8% owned by Google and the substantial deal, I think this has some room to run. Digging into their financials, the company has seen significant revenue growth over 3 years and this will be icing on the cake. Not sure how long it will play out, but I am very very interested. Also, I don’t want to undersell the fluid stack agreement.  I know that team well and consulted with them.  They have a MASSIVE backlog of AI customers who need space.  Absolutely massive list. I am sitting on 2027 LEAPs that I bought when it was around $2/share. Sheesh. I am sure that’s looking good. Congrats! The timing of this post: A+
The timing of me seeing this post: F- CoreWeave has 35x the market cap of $WULF and not much more capacity than $WULF and TW’s power pricing is vastly superior Why I rarely hit these kinds of gains lol.  But I am in the industry and have been following $WULF for years and years. Any guesses as to where the market cap will go with this news? Very interesting insight. I’m debating on how long I want to hold, but that is a solid point.

1mqkmoj,2025-08-15,"WWR After-Hours Breakout — Low Float, 4.56M Short, Analyst Target $2 🚀
Ticker: $WWR — Westwater Resources (NASDAQ: WWR)
Market Cap: ~$67.77M
Float: ~79.16M shares
Short Interest: 4.56M shares (~5.8% of float)
52W Range: $0.45 – $1.31
Sector: Graphite / Battery Materials


---

Why I’m Watching WWR

1. After-Hours Breakout

Closed +7.66% today at $0.7859.

After-hours pushed as high as $0.8280 with strong block trades (10K+, 12K shares).

Broke above the key $0.80 resistance in extended hours — now above the average cost for most holders ($0.81).



2. Short Interest Potential

Current short interest is 4.56M shares.

While not GME-level, this is enough for a momentum squeeze if price continues to climb.

Breaks above $0.85–$0.90 could accelerate short covering.



3. Fundamental Progress

Kellyton Graphite Processing Plant ~85% equipment installed.

Grid connection secured; qualification line producing over 1 metric ton CSPG for customer trials.

Financing in progress via $150M debt facility + EXIM Bank interest.

Positioned to supply critical battery materials for EV and defense markets.



4. Analyst Target

Only analyst coverage currently has a $2.00 price target (+150% upside from today).

Low float and retail control make it possible for WWR to move quickly on positive news.





---

Key Levels to Watch

Support: $0.78–$0.80 (needs to hold for bullish continuation)

Breakout Zone: $0.81–$0.85

Target 1: $0.85–$0.90

Target 2: $0.90+ (next resistance near $1.00)



---

My Plan

Watching premarket to see if $0.81 holds.

If momentum continues, I’ll look for an early push toward $0.85–$0.90.

Stop-loss just under $0.77 to limit downside.

1mq9vjs,2025-08-14,"CPSH earnings call summary BIG CONTRACTS FROM NAVY/DoD budget coming in! Will go to $25 again!
# Highlights from CPS Technologies Q2 2025 Earnings Call

* **Record Revenue Performance**: Achieved a new quarterly revenue record of $8.1 million, up 61% year-over-year from $5.0 million in Q2 2024 and 8% sequentially from Q1 2025. The company is on track for its best revenue year ever, driven by strong demand for core products (metal matrix composites and hermetic packaging), improved manufacturing output (including a third production shift added last year), and contributions from externally funded development contracts.
* **Profitability Turnaround**: Gross profit of $1.3 million (16.5% margin) compared to a gross loss in Q2 2024, due to higher revenues and manufacturing efficiencies. Operating profit of $137,000 vs. a $1.3 million loss last year. Net income of $100,000 ($0.01 per share) vs. a $0.9 million net loss ($0.07 per share) in Q2 2024.
* **Balance Sheet Strength**: Cash and marketable securities increased by nearly $0.5 million sequentially to $3.4 million total. Accounts receivable rose to $5.6 million (reflecting higher sales), inventories to $5.2 million (to meet demand), and payables/accruals to $4.3 million.
* **New Contracts and Innovations**:
   * Won fourth SBIR contract of 2025: Phase I with U.S. Navy for weight reduction on Amphibious Combat Vehicles (ACV), valued at $140,000 over 6 months, with an optional 6-month extension worth $100,000. Focuses on redesigning components like hatches and armor with lightweight composites.
   * Received first commercial purchase order for AlMax™ (fiber-reinforced aluminum composites), licensed exclusively from Triton Systems. Offers superior wear resistance and strength; seeing interest in multiple markets.
   * Executing two Phase I SBIRs (one Army, one Navy) incorporating AlMax™ for military ground vehicles.
   * Filed a non-provisional patent for radiation shielding material under a 2-year DOE-funded program (less than halfway complete).
   * Seven active funded programs: Four Phase I SBIRs, two Phase II SBIRs, and one non-SBIR from U.S. Naval Air Command—mostly DoD-funded, with potential for further R&D and commercialization.
* **Operational Focus**: Committed to margin expansion through manufacturing efficiencies, capacity utilization, and cost-reduction initiatives (e.g., modernization programs). Added five-axis machining capability to hermetic packaging. Addressing tariff headwinds on raw materials.
* **Market Opportunities**: Strong demand backlog for core products; pursuing additional armor orders with U.S. Navy and partner Kinetic Protection (optimistic for orders in coming quarters, tied to FY2026 defense budget). Emerging growth in high-voltage DC (HVDC) projects and wind turbines (linked to data center electricity demand), separate from traditional markets like traction/transportation.
* **Challenges and Outlook**: No severe capacity constraints, but actively planning expansions to handle robust demand. One prior radiation shielding contract was canceled (program-wide), but other opportunities remain active.

# Talking Points for Investors

These points emphasize CPS's growth trajectory, innovation pipeline, and shareholder value focus to appeal to investors:

* **Sustained Revenue Momentum**: CPS has delivered back-to-back record quarters, replacing lost armor revenue from 15 months ago with organic growth in core products and new tech. This demonstrates resilience and execution, positioning 2025 as a record year with a 4-6 month average order visibility window.
* **Profitability and Efficiency Drive**: While margins improved significantly YoY, management is prioritizing further gains through targeted initiatives (e.g., cost-down projects and modernization). This could enhance bottom-line results, cash flow, and return on assets, directly benefiting shareholders amid strong demand.
* **Innovation-Led Growth**: Portfolio of marketable technologies (e.g., AlMax™, radiation shielding) often funded externally via SBIRs reduces R&D risk. First AlMax™ order and new patent filing signal commercial traction; seven active DoD/DOE programs highlight defense sector leverage, where budgets prioritize lightweight, durable solutions.
* **Defense and Emerging Market Upside**: Optimism for ""huge"" armor orders in quarters ahead, given ongoing DoD discussions and FY2026 budget priorities. Additive opportunities in renewables (wind turbines via HVDC for data centers) could expand beyond core markets, tapping into global infrastructure trends.
* **Risk Mitigation**: Safe harbor notes geopolitical/economic uncertainties, but CPS's diversified customer base, domestic sourcing, and funded R&D provide buffers. Balance sheet liquidity supports growth investments without dilution.
* **Team and Execution Confidence**: Led by experienced team (e.g., material scientist Matthew Karnick on SBIRs); added third shift last Labor Day to scale production. Focus on commercialization ensures innovations translate to revenue.

# Timelines for New Contracts and Huge Orders

* **New SBIR Contracts**: The latest Navy Phase I for ACV weight reduction starts immediately (announced July 2025), running 6 months (through \~January 2026) for $140,000, with optional extension decision at end (additional 6 months, $100,000, through \~July 2026). CPS is actively pursuing more SBIRs, with potential awards in coming quarters based on proposal cycles.
* **AlMax™ Commercialization**: First order received recently (Q2 2025 execution); two ongoing Phase I SBIRs incorporating AlMax™ (Army and Navy) are in progress, with outcomes potentially leading to Phase II extensions in 6-12 months. Broader market traction expected to build over next 1-2 years as customer feedback grows.
* **Radiation Shielding**: DOE-funded 2-year program (started \~2024) is less than halfway done (completion \~mid-2026); pursuing commercial opportunities in parallel, with recent patent filing strengthening IP for near-term deals.
* **Huge Armor Orders**: No firm dates, but ""optimistic"" for additional orders ""in the quarters to come"" (Q3/Q4 2025 or early 2026), tied to FY2026 federal defense budget and ongoing discussions with DoD/Navy/Kinetic Protection. Past track record suggests potential for large-scale ship/vehicle applications.
* **Overall Pipeline**: Order cycles vary: 2-12 months, averaging 4-6 months for visibility. HVDC/wind opportunities expected to ""play out over the next couple of years"" (2025-2027). No specific ""huge"" order timelines beyond quarterly optimism, but strong backlog supports execution through 2025 and beyond.
Bro from what I can tell, the retail buying volume on this stock is off the hook this week - also looks like earnings were good with record revenue reporting and healthy gross margin (reported end of July) and there was an exec who bought shares (insider) 2 days ago.

“Director Ivo James Cavoli has made a significant investment by purchasing 9,425 shares of CPS Technologies stock, with the transaction valued at $26,235.”

1mq2af6,2025-08-14,"$TLRY 2025: This Rally Isn’t Last Year’s – Here’s My Take
Back in 2024, the move was mostly speculative. few real deals, no major international expansion, and a very uncertain political backdrop.

Today, the cards are completely different:

Real international expansion

* Just yesterday, a deal was announced with Molteni in Italy.
* New distribution channels and approvals are opening up the European market.

Bigger and more diversified portfolio

* More products in both medical and recreational cannabis.
* Potential to boost revenue across multiple segments.

Favorable political climate

* Now we have Trump talking about cannabis rescheduling.
* Unlike Biden, Trump usually doesn’t make these kinds of statements without having a concrete plan.
* Stronger global presence

TLRY is no longer relying solely on Canada or the U.S. operations now span multiple countries.

The key difference now is that we’re not just looking at rumors, but actual deals and new markets that can drive real revenue.

Personally, I’ll be holding my TLRY position until Trump brings new updates.  
What do you think about these fundamentals? 

see bullsandbearstrading
Trump has concrete plans? Did you really just say that? Because the man is infamous for saying he's got ""concepts"" of a plan and nothing else.

Anyway, and regardless of Trump's rhetoric, I'm heavily invested in TLRY. It's only a matter of time before cannabis is FINALLY federally legalized. “Trump doesn’t make these kind of statements without having a concrete plan”

Wow you’re fukn idiot.

UPDATE 2025-08-22 I hope some people on this sub got some [EDT.to](http://EDT.to) (CAD) or EDTXF (US). Seems likes it's starting to cook.

Back of the envelope analyst say it could be worth 6+if taken over by its billion dollar partner once it gets FDA approval. Also a fund controls a large chunk of the stock so they will not let Spectral be taken out for cheap. This is just MHO. Do your own DD.

# Spectral Medical and Vantive Announce Topline Results from Spectral's Tigris Trial Evaluating PMX Hemoadsorption Therapy for Endotoxic Septic Shock

[T.EDT](https://stockhouse.com/companies/quote?symbol=t.edt) | 1 day ago

* ***Results exceed prespecified primary endpoint of 95% posterior probability of benefit for PMX on 28-day mortality***
* ***Pooled absolute risk reduction of 8.3%; Relative risk reduction of 18%***
* ***Key secondary endpoint: 90-day Mortality 17.4% lower with PMX and >99% posterior probability of benefit***
* ***38.7% Mortality at 28 days with PMX confirms results of prior trial subset***

TORONTO, Ontario and DEERFIELD, Ill., Aug. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **Spectral Medical Inc. (“Spectral”) (TSX: EDT),** a late-stage theranostic company advancing therapeutic options for sepsis and septic shock, and Vantive, a vital organ therapy company committed to pursuing novel diagnostic and therapeutic options for organ failure, today announced topline results from the Tigris trial. This Phase 3 follow-on study sponsored by Spectral evaluated the use of Polymyxin B Hemoadsorption (“PMX”) in a randomized clinical trial of adults treated for endotoxic septic shock.

Each year, approximately 5-7 million cases of endotoxic septic shock, a particularly deadly form of sepsis, occur worldwide.^(1) Today, there is no specific therapy targeting this patient population currently available in the United States. The Tigris trial was a U.S.-based, multicenter, randomized, controlled Phase 3 study evaluating PMX in adults with endotoxic septic shock, defined by an Endotoxin Activity Assay (“EAA”) level between 0.60 and 0.90. EAA is an FDA approved, semiquantitative test for measurement of endotoxin activity, allowing for rapid measurements to obtain results in approximately 30 minutes. The treating physician can use these results to help inform timely therapeutic decisions. Eligible patients also had to meet criteria for multiple organ dysfunction, including a Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (“MODS”) >9 or a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (“SOFA”) score of >11. A total of 157 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either PMX plus standard care (n=106) or standard care alone (n=51).

The primary endpoint—28-day all-cause mortality—was evaluated using a prespecified Bayesian statistical model, which evaluates results in the context of prior probability. The model incorporated data from 179 patients in the previously conducted EUPHRATES trial alongside the data from the Tigris trial. The EUPHRATES trial was conducted in North America and examined the impact of PMX on mortality in patients with septic shock and endotoxemia. The goal of the Tigris trial was to confirm the benefit of PMX hemoadsorption in patients with endotoxic septic shock, defined by EAA 0.60 but < 0.90. The Tigris trial’s design and analysis plan were aligned with published FDA’s *Guidance for the Use of Bayesian Statistics in Medical Device Clinical Trials*.^(2)

**Key Findings of the Tigris Trial and Bayesian Analysis:**

The purpose of Bayesian analysis is to update prior evidence with new trial data, producing a ‘posterior probability’ that reflects the most current and complete picture of the treatment effect. Results are presented for adjusted and unadjusted analyses. Consistent with expert recommendations and the FDA’s guidance on clinical trials, the adjusted analysis is used to account for baseline prognostic covariates such as severity of illness and comorbidities – which provides a more precise estimate of the true treatment effect. Unadjusted analyses do not account for these important differences.

**Primary Endpoint (28-Day Mortality):**

* Intention to treat cohort showed a posterior probability of benefit of 95.3% at 28 days
* Adjusted odds ratio 0.67 \[0.39-1.08\]
   * Adjusted posterior probability of benefit from PMX at 28 days exceeds the prespecified 95% target and thus meets the prespecified primary endpoint.
* Observed 28-day mortality for Tigris was 38.7% with PMX vs 45.1% with standard of care – 6.4% absolute difference.
   * Unadjusted absolute risk reduction from the posterior distribution was 8.3% \[-2.1%, 19.7%\] representing a 18% relative risk reduction, posterior probability 92.3%.
   * Observed 28-day mortality from the modified intention to treat population (includes 100 PMX and 51 control patients receiving any assigned treatment) was 37.0% with PMX vs 45.1% with standard of care – 8.1% absolute difference.

**Key Secondary Endpoint (90-Day Mortality):**

* The key secondary endpoint, mortality at 90 days, showed a >99% posterior probability of benefit for PMX.
* Adjusted odds ratio 0.54 \[0.32-0.87\]
   * Adjusted posterior probability of benefit from PMX at 90 days was 99.4%.
* Observed mortality at 90 days (Tigris alone): 43.4% with PMX vs. 60.8% with standard of care – 17.4% absolute difference.
   * Unadjusted absolute risk reduction from the posterior distribution was 12.3% \[0.76%, 23.7%\] representing a 20.2% relative risk reduction, posterior probability 98.3%.
   * Resultant number needed to treat (“NNT”) to save 1 life at 90 days is 8.1.

Dr. John Kellum, Chief Medical Officer of Spectral Medical, commented, “We are pleased to announce that the fully adjusted Bayesian analysis met our prespecified goal of >95% posterior probability of benefit for 28-day mortality. As we explained in our November 14, 2023 press release, our published simulations involving over 2,000 potential trial results found an observed absolute risk reduction for mortality in the range of 6 - 7% in Tigris would meet this bar. Final results from Tigris indicate that our observed 6.4% difference yields a 95.3% posterior probability and thus exceeds this threshold. Furthermore our 90 days results provide important confirmation that benefits with PMX are persistent.”

Professor Claudio Ronco, Director of the International Renal Research Institute of Vicenza IRRIV and world-renowned expert in blood purification for sepsis, commented, “The results that we see today are a clear confirmation of what we observed more than 16 years ago with the EUPHAS trial. Tigris, together with a subset of patients from EUPHRATES indicate that hemoadsorption therapy with PMX can be effective if we select the correct population. Like in EUPHAS, patients in the Tigris trial have a 28-day mortality of approximately 50% unless treated with PMX. The benefit for survival from PMX becomes even more dramatic at 90 days where it exceeds 17%. This is not unexpected as today many patients can be maintained on life support for more than 28 days – as such, longer term survival is a more accurate reflection of benefit.”

Dr. Danielle Davison, Professor of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine and Director of the Intensive Care Unit, George Washington University, Washington, DC, commented, “Having participated in both EUPHRATES and Tigris, it is particularly satisfying to see these final results. We look forward to having this therapy available for our patients.”

“Vantive is committed to supporting clinical research to advance therapy innovation and expand access to care for critically ill patients,” said Professor Peter Rutherford, Head of Worldwide Medical at Vantive. “We are encouraged by these results, and look forward to continuing to work toward addressing unmet clinical needs and improving outcomes for patients affected by endotoxic septic shock.”

“The results from Tigris represent a significant milestone for Spectral as we continue advancing toward our goal of improving outcomes in endotoxic septic shock,” said Chris Seto, Chief Executive Officer of Spectral Medical. “When considered alongside prior evidence from the EUPHRATES trial and real-world global experience, the totality of data supporting PMX continues to strengthen. Importantly, the safety profile observed in Tigris was consistent with PMX’s historical use with over 360,000 units sold worldwide. These findings further support our planned FDA PMA submission and our efforts to make this therapy available to the patients who need it most.”

Vantive is Spectral's exclusive distributor of PMX in the U.S. and Canada and has non-exclusive rights to distribute EAA globally. Spectral Medical intends to submit the final Premarket Approval (“PMA”) module (Module 3) for PMX to the FDA by end of October 2025. If approved by the FDA, Vantive plans to commercialize both EAA and PMX, beginning in the United States, to support Targeted Rapid Endotoxin Adsorption (TREA) Therapy. TREA therapy brings precision medicine to sepsis, delivering rapid, decisive treatment for patients with endotoxic septic shock.

Full results from the Tigris trial will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming major medical conference and for publication in a peer-reviewed journal later this year.

The Tigris Trial is a confirmatory study of PMX in addition to standard care vs standard care alone and is designed as a 2:1 randomized trial of 150 patients using Bayesian statistics. Endotoxic septic shock is a malignant form of sepsis [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RANrHHi9L8.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=A8PtkuTo03mLZbDq_Wz385n85KY4OLYd3VcBKjp1-LFyTVa67QjArS2cZEv9MwGnHxCcV8kurBD6uXfZwYiAe0PHChUJvrg0EvDwgLBOmOOoDgUA3pWOJGAiHxwtC3_I1W81mUjjWRSO78vnZMdRIG3P8XReLuZWx0KQ3XyCaho=)

1mped5v,2025-08-13,"NRx Pharmaceuticals (NRxP) -- This one is LIVE! Analysts just upgraded their targets to $21 and $31 based on Fast Track granted by FDA this week.  Has two drugs that address the national crisis of suicidal ideation in depression, including bipolar depression.  Aiming for PDUFA/approval in 2025.
**WALL STREET TAKING NOTICE:**  As I was writing this post today, this article was just posted on ETrade (VERY TIMELY):

[From Novel Therapies To Treat Suicidal Bipolar Depression To Launching A Network Of Clinics, NRx Pharmaceuticals Is Getting Attention On Wall Street | FinancialContent](https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/article/thenewswire-2025-8-13-from-novel-therapies-to-treat-suicidal-bipolar-depression-to-launching-a-network-of-clinics-nrx-pharmaceuticals-is-getting-attention-on-wall-street)

If you are looking for the opportunity for the real potential of a 9x to 13x bagger (per the analysts' newly updated targets), NRx is a great candidate based on the below list of facts. If you want to consider investing in NRXP you will need to take the time to read this post.  I have tried to make it as concise as possible and give you the full picture. I bought 10,000 shares yesterday at $2.40.

The stars are now aligning fast for NRx (note the very current milestone dates below), which has been quietly preparing to **dominate in the depression/suicidality space** with its two drug candidates.

* **NRX-100**: **preservative-free** intravenous (IV) **ketamine** infusion, to treat suicidal ideation in patients with depression, including bipolar depression
   * Note: **PTSD** can increase the risk of depression and is significantly associated with suicidal ideation
   * Rapid and statistically significant reduction in suicidal ideation
   * **Eliminates** benzethonium chloride **(BZT), a neurotoxic preservative** found in most ketamine products
   * 3-year room-temperature shelf life (military can use without cold-chain logistics)
   * Originally granted Fast Track Designation by the FDA in 2017, was only for bipolar depression
   * **Aug 11, 2025 NEWS:** Granted **expanded Fast Track Designation** by the FDA, **increasing the addressable patient population by 10x to 13 million U.S. adults**
      * [New to The Street Client NRx Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:NRXP) Secures ... 2025-08-11](https://www.pr-inside.com/new-to-the-street-client-nrx-pharmaceuticals-nasdaq-nrxp-secures-r5126710.htm)
      * Reflects FDA's recognition that NRX-100 aligns with eligibility for Accelerated Approval and **CNPV** (see FDA section below)
   * Initial **NDA filed on Dec 20, 2024**, which included Module 3 (manufacturing), with remaining sections to be completed by **June 2025**
   * Filed an **ANDA (abbreviated NDA)** with the FDA, for NRX-100, on **June 5, 2025**
      * Targets all existing approved indications of ketamine, such as **anesthesia** and **pain management**
* **NRX-101: oral (pill)** fixed-dose combination of D-cycloserine and lurasidone, to treat:
   * Suicidal bipolar depression, esp. in patients who are treatment resistant
   * Akathisia, a severe side effect of some antipsychotics linked to increased suicide risk
      * Industry-leading 75% reduction in Akathisia
   * Designed as a step-down therapy after IV ketamine to help sustain remission (33% improvement)
   * Granted **Breakthrough Therapy Designation** by the FDA
   * **The first drug in FDA trials for suicidal bipolar depression**
   * **NDA preparation in progress as of March 2025**

**FDA CNPV Program**

* NRx has applied for the new FDA **Commissioner's National Priority Voucher (CNPV) program** \[**reduces FDA review time to 1 - 2 months**\] , because **NRX-100** meets its criteria (only one of which is required):  addresses a national health crisis, addresses unmet public health needs, domestic drug manufacturing for national security
* **Watch for an announcement at any time**: If and when the CNPV is granted, then a potential approval decision will be imminent

**Manufacturing**

* NRX-100 is **manufactured** in collaboration with **Nephron Pharmaceuticals, a well-established FDA-approved sterile manufacturing facility** located in West Columbia, South Carolina

**Potential Game Changer**

* NRx filed a **Citizen Petition** with the FDA, **on Aug 4, 2025**:
   * **Seeking removal of the neurotoxic preservative BZT from all ketamine products sold in the U.S.**
   * Could force reformulation or withdrawal of BZT-containing products
   * Could create a first-mover advantage
   * Aligns with the FDA's broader push to eliminate toxic excipients

**NRx's Dual Strategy**

* Provide the drug treatments and roll up interventional psychiatry clinics across the U.S., which will deliver the treatments (also for PTSD, e.g., for veterans and first responders)
* **Hope Therapeutics** is a wholly owned subsidiary of NRx.  Best I could find is they have approximately 10 or 11 clinics, counting the 2 in Florida that are in the process of closing and which just received approval from Florida's AHCA on **Aug 8, 2025**
   * Initial goal by end of 2025 is $100M in revenue, as stated in Jan 2025

**ANALYST TARGETS (effective Aug 11, 2025)**

* **BTIG: From $18 to $21** [NRx Pharmaceuticals stock price target raised to $21 by BTIG on FDA progress By Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/nrx-pharmaceuticals-stock-price-target-raised-to-21-by-btig-on-fda-progress-93CH-4183497)
* **D. Boral:** **$31**

**SHARES**

* Outstanding 19.5M (Fintel)
* Public Float 16.17M (Fintel)
* MC $49M (ETrade)
* Short Shares 614,859 (as of 7/31/2025 nasdaq.com)
* Inside Ownership 15.9% (Fintel)
* Institutional Ownership 13.2% (Fintel)

**FINANCES** (Update for Q2 2025, s/b tomorrow 8/14 with Earnings Report and Call)

* COH: $6M as of Mar 31, 2025
* Quarterly Burn Rate: $2M est.
* Long-Term Debit: $10.3M (financing clinic acquisitions via debt, so they are non-dilutive)
* Pre-Revenue as of March 31, 2025
* Convertible note and equity offering in Jan 2025

**MILESTONE PAYMENT AGREEMENTS**

* **For NRX-100**
* Partner: Undisclosed pharma company (non-binding terms accepted)
* Milestone Potential: Over $300M in development and sales milestones
* Royalties: Tiered double-digit royalties based on net sales
* Status: Terms accepted; agreement not yet finalized
   * Source: NRx Corporate Update - March 17, 2025
* **For NRX-101**
* Partner: Alvogen and Lotus Pharmaceutical
* Initial Payment: $5M on Feb 12, 2024
* Positive P2 Meeting: $4M
* Milestone Potential: Up to $324M in development and sales milestones
* Royalties: Tiered double-digit, escalating to the mid teen on net sales
Been in this one since January.  I know it’s been a long ride for nrxp but they have positioned themselves extremely well with their recent clinic purchases and partnerships. They have gotten private funding to help with the the costs of the FDA approvals and fast tracks instead of burning shareholders with dilution.    They have done everything right in the past 10-12 months and we should expect fda approval any day now I swore off Pharma stocks for life… but maybe just one more 🙃 Things are moving fast, and the announcement of a PDUFA date or CNPV being approved should make the share price really move up hard.

MC is small. Buying after those announcements will still likely bring a great return, but not near what buying under $5 will bring, in my opinion.

Check out the Chairman’s experience. I think the chance of their being granted the CNPV is VERY high for approval.  They need to continue to send updates.  They have been quietly getting the job done, but these very recent analyst upgrades along with the Fast Track designation, and now this article about Wall Street noticing is a great start of super PR.

It's likely going to move fast from here, and the stock will fly accordingly.  The other thing is the Citizen Petition.  If that gets approved, the high side of the targets will be hit much more quickly, in my opinion. Well done / well done / amazing read!! Thank you so much for this FDA doesn't ""allow"" or ""forbid"" off-label usage of medications.  For example, Duloxetine (SNRI antidepressant) is used off-label for urinary incontinence in females--works well.

What tends to limit off-label usage is insurance company coverage, out-of-pocket drug costs, and malpractice risks.

Speaking as a physician here that prescribes off-label medications all the time.

Here is a backward example:  Thorazine (that ole timey medicine used to treat Schizophrenia) is FDA labeled to treat hiccups.  It works, but many insurance companies won't pay for it because the cost has risen.  So, Haldol (another Schizophrenia medication), which is not FDA labeled for hiccups is used instead because it is covered by insurance and it is inexpensive.

FDA's role?  Doesn't force physicians or insurance companies to use the labeled (approved) medication and doesn't address the not approved (off labeled) use of Haldol. They are being prudent with cash and taking on debt to acquire the desired national network of psy clinics.

If they can get approved this year then milestone payments should help commercialization, which immediately can be delivered to their own clinics.

The clinics’ profit will pay their debt and have money left over to help pay for opex. 

I don’t worry about dilution in this case. When they get approval and the stock is at $10 for example, if they dilute 3M shares for commercialization purposes ($30M in addition to milestone payments), for example, that is likely only 12% of fully diluted shares. It is a bump in the road.

This company should do $200M to $300M in revenue in the next 2 years.
They are aiming for $100M in Hope revenues by end of 2025 (dont know if they will get there by eoy). 

Put a standard multiple on sales or net income and you get a 10 to 15 bagger. 

If they remain prudent with cash, shareholders will be very happy. I have seen companies announce a private placement (dilution) and the share price rises bc the market feels secure they have cash to execute 

They could dilute now but they are running lean and tight to see if they can get the approval by year end.  They seem judicious and mindful of shareholders.

I don’t know specifics of milestone dilution, but again I don’t let it phase me. It is part of the process.

If they end up with 30M fully diluted shares, that is fine by me. If they get revenues to $200M ($100M from clinics at 15% margin and $100M drug sales at 30% margin/royalties) two years after approval (and NRX-101 approved by Q1 or Q2 2026), then the MC should be $400M to $600M— 13x to 20x.

The analysts’ targets are less, but they are 12-month targets.

Bottom line, it is lining up well. Mire announcements coming and the share price should rise. Then on approval another good bump and they manufacture and immediately feed all their clinics. A very cool setup. They rescheduled earnings to August 19 hmmmm. That’s where I make my money. I really don’t invest in anything else.

1mp520e,2025-08-13,"$CPSH - Promising Catalysts and Bullish Chart Trends! New 52 week high and chart is setup. Micro-cap
Hey everyone

 I’ve been keeping an eye on CPS Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ: CPSH), a penny stock with some exciting potential, and I wanted to share my thoughts. CPSH is a small-cap company providing advanced material solutions (metal matrix composites) to industries like aerospace, defense, automotive, and energy. With a current price around $2.85-$3.50 (as of recent data), it’s showing signs of momentum, and here’s why I’m optimistic:Upcoming Catalysts

* Military Contracts: CPSH has secured multiple SBIR (Small Business Innovation Research) contracts from the U.S. Navy and Army in 2025, including a recent Phase I award for fuel economy improvements and additive manufacturing for munitions. These contracts could lead to larger orders, especially given their history of stock surges (e.g., past Navy contract boosts).
* Commercial Expansion: The company is launching commercialization of new materials, with capacity expansions underway. Management has hinted at strong back-half-of-the-year guidance, suggesting revenue growth.
* Insider Buying: Recent filings show insiders, including the CEO and CFO, purchasing shares (e.g., buys at $1.55-$1.57 in March 2025), signaling confidence in future performance.
* Financial Turnaround: Q1 2025 reported record revenue of $7.5M (+26.9% YoY) and a return to profitability ($0.10M net income), a big improvement from prior losses.

Stock Chart Positives

* Breakout Potential: CPSH recently broke out of the $3 range with decent volume, hitting a 52-week high of $3.58. The stock’s up 77-87% YTD and 73-90% over the past year, outpacing the S&P 500.
* Technical Setup: The chart shows a consolidation phase with strong support around $2.70-$2.80 and resistance near $3.40-$3.50. Bollinger Bands and rising volume suggest a potential move higher, with some traders eyeing $5 or even $20 if catalysts hit (based on historical patterns).
* Low Float & Ownership: With a float of \~11.3M shares and insider ownership at 15.6%, plus institutional interest from Vanguard and BlackRock, there’s room for price appreciation with limited dilution (no dilution in years).
* Volatility Advantage: A beta of 1.47 indicates it moves more than the market, which can amplify gains during bullish runs.

Why I’m Bullish

* No debt and a solid cash position ($3.42M) provide financial stability.
* The company’s niche in high-growth sectors (e.g., defense, EV tech) aligns with long-term trends.
* Sentiment on platforms like X is heating up, with users noting insider buys and potential DoD orders as game-changers.

Of course, penny stocks carry risks—low liquidity and volatility can lead to sharp drops. But with these catalysts and a chart showing upward momentum, $CPSH looks like a stock worth watching. I’m holding a small position and plan to add on dips. What do you all think—any other insights or targets you’re seeing?

Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. Do your own research and consider your risk tolerance. I’m just sharing my analysis!


This is really one to watch if the catalysts continue to hit Agree! I’ve been buying this for the past 6 months and if the catalyst hits it will be beautiful  Been holding for months, if the past couple days are any indication, It will explode very soon Why are the volumes so low typically ?

1mocovt,2025-08-12,"MDAI - A Deep Dive into the Future of Tech in Healthcare
*Yes, I used chatgpt to help format my raw thoughts and research. This one was 6 pages long and honestly I really don't like how chatgpt formatted it and left out important things, but anyway some things had to go I guess and why did it bold text throughout lol (I fixed that).*

Earnings are end of day today. I am hoping for either guidance or positive talk about the current De Novo filing. Either way I'm holding for the long haul here. I am in with 10,000 shares @ $2.60 so take that as you will but I'm not trying to pump the stock just sincerely want us all to find the best stocks together.   


DeepView (Spectral AI / MDAI) — numbers that actually matter

# TL;DR (with hard numbers)

* **What:** AI imaging that predicts heal vs won’t-heal for burns/complex wounds.
* **Regulatory:** Breakthrough (2018). De Novo filed 6/30/2025 → target early 2026.
* **Performance:** Sensitivity 86.6% / Specificity 81.9% vs burn-physicians 40.8% / 38.8%.
* **Speed & workflow:** 30–60s scan, usable Day 0, ≈10 min to competency; practically ≤1 day of training (n≈1 day course available).
* **Economics:** Save $5k–$15k per patient (avoid $20–30k grafts; cut 5–7 days LOS at $2–3k/day; fewer $1–2ktests).
* **Military:** Handheld “SnapShot M” in late R\&D; >$7M BARDA/MTEC/DHA non-dilutive backing which is the military already funding the research.
* **Data scale:** \~40k scans ≈ 340B spectral-pixel points (same order as \~300B GPT-3 tokens → comparable scale of training signal, different modality).
* **Financials (2024):** Rev $29.6M (+63.5%), GM 44%, Net loss \~$15.3M (-27% YoY), Cash \~$14.1M; op CF ≈ 22% of debt service (runway risk).
* **TAM:** Burns \~$600M, DFU \~$1.1B.
* **Sketchy upside:** Hospital clr \~5–8×, Military \~2–3×, both \~6–10×; no clr \~0.65–0.85×.

# What it is (2 systems)

* 🏥 **Hospital Cart (DeepView):** sequential 8-λ capture; 30–60s scan; EHR integration; De Novo submitted 6/30/25; aims early-2026 clearance pending Burn Validation + mfg docs.
* 🪖 **“SnapShot M” Handheld:** \~500 g, 5″ screen, <1s snapshot (5 micro-cameras capture 8 wavelengthssimultaneously), MIL-STD-810G, IP54, \~4h battery. Advanced R&D with BARDA/MTEC/DHA; no FDA dateyet.

**Reimbursement path:** Working with AMA for CPT® codes → bill Medicare/Medicaid/private per scan.

# How it works (8 wavelengths, plain-English)

Each wavelength isolates a different tissue/oxygenation signal. Together they estimate from surface → deep tissue: total oxygenation, total perfusion, edema, tissue integrity, with skin-tone control.

1. **Superficial oxy/deoxy-hemoglobin absorption** (surface oxygenation)
2. **Melanin/bilirubin absorption** (pigment/jaundice control)
3. **Capillary blood volume** (Hb peak = microvascular fill)
4. **Early deoxy-hemoglobin shoulder** (incipient hypoxia)
5. **Pulse-ox red channel** (deeper perfusion proxy)
6. **Water absorption shoulder** (edema indicator)
7. **NIR oxy/deoxy-hemoglobin** (deep perfusion)
8. **NIR scattering slope** (tissue matrix/integrity)

**Output:** 0–100% healing probability with a calibrated threshold → Will heal / Won’t heal.

# Why this beats status quo (numbers)

* **Versus LDI:**
   * **When:** DeepView Day 0 vs LDI \~48h post-burn.
   * **Time:** 30–60s vs 2–5 min + processing.
   * **Environment:** Ambient light + normal tremor tolerated vs dark room/very still patient.
   * **Signals:** Perfusion + oxygenation + edema + integrity vs perfusion only.
   * **Interpretation:** Yes/No + confidence vs perfusion map + trained tech.
* **Versus biopsy:** avoids infection risk/pain; avoids 1–2 week delay.

# Workflow & training (adoption reality)

* **Hands-on in \~10 minutes**, with a full 1-day optional training → practically **≤1 day** to get clinical staff productive.
* Balanced “pistol” handle, dual alignment lasers for easy aligning for scan.
* Live grayscale preview; haptic + chime when aligned; onboard lighting → room-light immune.
* **Accelerometer** tolerates <5 mm tremor.

# Data scale (why 340B matters)

* Training corpus: \~40,000 scans → **\~**340,000,000,000 spectral-pixel data points.
* For intuition: **GPT-3 \~300B tok**ens. DeepView’s 340B isn’t language tokens, but it’s the same order of magnitude of training signal density—supporting robust generalization across skin tones, depths, and wound types.

# Money math buyers care about

* **Avoided graft**: $20–30k each.
* **Shorter stay**: 5-7 days saved × $2–3k/day.
* **Fewer tests**: $1–2k per biopsy/LDI avoided.
* Net $5–15k per patient savings → faster bed turnover + margin protection.

# Company/financial snapshot

* **FY24 rev $29.6M (+63.5%)**, **GM 44%** (below med-AI \~60% → room to expand).
* **Net loss \~$15.3M** (from \~$20.9M in ’23; -27%).
   * Illustrative loss decay, assuming no rev step-up: **Yr3 \~$11.0M → Yr4 \~$9.7M → Yr5 \~$7.6M**.
* **Cash \~$14.1M**; op CF ≈ **22%** of debt service → runway/dilution risk if timelines slip.
* **Analysts (3):** $4.50–$7.82, Strong Buy.
* **EPS:** **$1.29 (2023) → $0.85 (2024)** (moving toward breakeven).

# Markets & upside (back-of-envelope)

* **TAM:** Burns \~$600M + DFU \~$1.1B.
* If hospital clearance → \~$100M sales, \~$45M net: med-device comps 3–5× rev ⇒ +\~$300–$500M EV(adoption/margins/dilution dependent).
* **Military:** $50k/device, \~200 devices to U.S. burn-center network (company vision) + field/allies/disaster relief ⇒ \~+$100M EV potential.

**Scenario sketch:**

* 🏥 Hospital only: **massive value increase**.
* 🪖 Military only: **less massive value increase**.
* Both: **a combined increase of nice**.
* No clearance:  bummer dawg.

# Leadership (signals that matter)

* **CEO change (Oct ’24):** single-CEO replaced by small operating committee (CFO/GC, CCO, interim COO, GM) reporting to Board; ex-CEO consulting to \~Jan ’26. Common stabilization move post-resignation.
* **Chair — Dr. J. Michael DiMaio:** Surgeon, founder (2009), prior CEO/Chair (’11–’20), Baylor Scott & White leader.
* **CFO & GC — Vincent S. Capone:** Ex-KPMG CPA; Morgan Lewis/Reed Smith partner; PE leadership.
* **COO — Stanley Micek:** Interim ’24 → permanent 5/30/’25; MiMedx BD/Strategy; OSU Cancer Center; MiMedx portfolio mainly HCT/Ps.
* **CCO — Jeremiah A. Sparks:** Drove RECELL PMA launches at AVITA; prior J&J/Healthpoint/Allergan → real U.S. launch muscle.
* **GM Mfg — Louis Percoco:** 30+ yrs med-device eng; IP links AMEI/Orthofix.
* **EVP — Prof. Paul Chadwick:** Ex-CEO Royal College of Podiatry; NHS/academia; UK/EU adoption.
* **Co-founder — Wensheng Fan:** Now Chief Innovation Strategist/Sr Advisor; prior leadership at Navini Networks (acquired by Cisco) and Precision Drilling’s services unit (later acquired by Weatherford) → credible build-to-outcome track record; in 2025 leading DeepRx (AI clinical decision tools).

# What must go right (success gates/KPIs)

1. **De Novo label & timing** (early ’26 still intact?).
2. **CPT® codes + payer coverage** (rate/setting; burn & DFU).
3. **Real-world performance** near 86.6/81.9 across sites/skin tones.
4. **Adoption curve:** carts placed, monthly scans/device, payback <12 months.
5. **Financing**: runway through clearance + first reimbursement, minimal dilution.
6. **Military**: SnapShot M field data → procurement path (BARDA/DoD follow-on $$).

# Bottom line

DeepView’s thesis is quant-led: better accuracy (86.6/81.9), Day-0 decisions in ≤60s, practically ≤1 day to train, and $5–15k per-patient savings. If De Novo + CPT + adoption land before runway issues, we will be sitting pretty. Don't forget about the Trump factor and liking flashy things either, not that this is not a legit device with revolutionary technological implementation, but that doesn't hurt either.

Management,  area of need,  currently low market cap. Sales should be easy because the device will bring down costs. Device is not complicated

All of the stocks I've had in the past that check my boxes ( check boxes change for different areas, so medical stocks will not be the same as, for instance,  banking), they've all done well ..   and i see no reason this one will not do the same. 

I think approval will come before christmas.

2 Outperform Rated Small Caps with Recent Pull-backs  
Zacks Investment Research, Inc. - Mon Aug 11, 5:00PM CDT Contributor Content  
  
Here we highlight 2 small cap stocks with Zacks’ Outperform ratings that pulled back despite recent quarterly announcements which were arguably strong but a bit noisy.  
  
Elite Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ELTP) is a manufacturer of generic drugs. Its focus on controlled-release products which requires a higher level of manufacturing skill, combined with vertical integration, are key differentiators in what is commonly viewed as a price-sensitive commodity business. These complex formulations include CNS stimulants, abuse-deterrent pain medications and antimetabolites.  
  
Elite Pharmaceuticals (ELTP) maintains strong positions in the mixed Amphetamine Immediate Release (IR) and Extended Release (ER) markets, which serve as foundational cash flow generators. But the real growth driver is coming from the ADHD (Attention-Deficit/ Hyper-active Disorder) market.  
  
According to IQVIA data cited in fiscal 2025 earnings commentary, ELTP commands approximately 20% of the $400 million generic Adderall IR market and 16% of the $800 million Adderall ER market, split between 11% under the Elite label and 5% under Prasco’s label.  
  
  
In fourth-quarter fiscal 2025, total revenues were approximately $31.9 million, up 78.3% from $17.9 million in the year-ago period. For fourth-quarter fiscal 2025, operating income came in at roughly $11.2 million, up from $3.7 million in the year-ago period.  
  
Elite Pharmaceuticals entered the competitive lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse generic) market in early 2025 and quickly captured an estimated 8–10% market share despite competing with more than a dozen suppliers. While pricing pressures persist, management noted that the product’s contribution has been substantial and margin-accretive. The Attention-Deficit/ Hyper-active Disorder treatment category remains large and growing, particularly as branded prescriptions continue transitioning to generics.  
  
  
So why the pull-back after earnings? While difficult to speculate exactly, a few things may have caused some investor anxiety. Firstly, the quarter contained some noise in the form of a roughly $7.2 m warrant charge which negatively impacted EPS and resulted from the significant appreciation in the stock.  
  
However, this is a required accounting treatment which is a non-cash charge and doesn’t impugn the underlying strength and leverage to the business. The company did cite increased competition in the ADHD generic space which may cause concerns about pricing erosion. In terms of tariff impact there is no current material impact and the significant inventory build in the quarter is most likely a hedge against this.  
  
Lastly, perhaps recent priority to selling the business vs. uplisting to Nasdaq is creating fear of a rushed process and a possible sub optimal price take-out.  
  
Regardless, we believe the investment thesis remains intact predicated upon continued penetration in the ADHD market with potential additional upside from international expansion.  
  
The stock is currently trading at 6.8X trailing 12-month EV/Sales TTM, which compares to 2.9X for the Zacks sub-industry, 2.8X for the Zacks sector and 5.5X for the S&P 500 Index. Over the past five years, the stock has traded as high as 10.5X and as low as 0.7X, with a five-year median of 2.2X.  
  
  
The stock is currently trading at 20.6X trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA TTM, which compares to 8.8X for the Zacks sub-industry, 10X for the Zacks sector and 18X for the S&P 500 Index.  
  
Over the past five years, the stock has traded as high as 64.2X and as low as 3.7X, with a five-year median of 12.3X.  
  
  
Disclosure: Mark owns ELTP in his personal portfolio.

1mnwgry,2025-08-12,"$WLDS: Patent Win Sends Shares Soaring Early, But Volatility hits !!!
Quick Company Overview

•  Ticker: WLDS (NASDAQ)
•  Market Cap: ~$3.35M (tiny, which means high volatility)

•  Current Price: Around $1.47 (closed down ~5.6% today after an early spike) ￼ – after-hours dipping to $1.37.

•  What They Do: Develop gesture-controlled wearables using AI and neural tech. Think controlling devices with finger movements without touching screens. Their flagship is the Mudra Link, and they’ve been pushing into AR/VR integration.

•  Financials (TTM): Revenue only $522K, net loss of -$7.88M, EPS -$24.20. Cash on hand ~$4M, but burning through it. Not profitable yet, classic early-stage tech play. ￼

Today’s Action & Recent News: 

•  Patent Win: Big catalyst today – they snagged a U.S. patent for their gesture tech, which sent shares up over 12% in the morning. ￼ ￼ Traded over 20M shares, which is huge for their low float (under 1M shares outstanding from what I’m seeing on alerts). ￼ But it faded hard into the close, down 5.56%. ￼ Classic pump on news?

•  Recent Raise: Closed a $2.4M warrant exercise last week (Aug 7), giving them some runway for R&D. ￼ They’re using it for working capital – good for survival.

•  Older Buzz: Back in April, they launched a “Gesture Mapper” for personalized neural control, which got some hype. ￼ Wearables market is hot with Apple Vision Pro and Meta stuff, so potential upside if they partner up.

Why It Might Pop
•  Low Float + Momentum: With such a small float, any volume can rocket it. Traders are watching for breaks above $2.25-$2.30. ￼ ￼ If more patent/news hits or AR/VR adoption grows, could see 50-100% moves.

•  Sector Tailwinds: Wearables are booming – think fitness trackers evolving into neural interfaces. If WLDS nails a big deal (e.g., with Samsung or Oculus), moonshot potential.

•  YTD Performance: Down 83% YTD, ￼ so it’s beaten down and could rebound on catalysts.

This isn’t financial advice – I’m just a random redditor sharing DD. Do your own research before making any investment.

1mnmtam,2025-08-11,"Amplitech Group Inc. Stock - Upcoming earnings and more
I am honestly amazed it is not talked about more on here, but I thought I would do a post on it to make more people aware of it. I honestly wish I had put more into it sooner, but this is a penny stock I plan to hold long-term. My cost basis is $2.47 at about 500 shares. I decided to use ChatGPT for summarizing as I feel like spending an hour writing a summary up.

# Key Takeaways based on last earnings:

* **Q1 2025 was the strongest** of the past four quarters. Revenue grew \~42% YoY to $3.60 M, and EPS improved significantly (–$0.09 vs. –$0.16), which triggered a **near 10% stock rally**.
* **Q4 2024 marked a low point**, with revenue falling to $1.85 M and EPS dropping to –$0.32; stock edged down \~1%.
* **Q3 2024** showed moderate improvement—EPS at –$0.12 and a modest revenue rebound (\~$2.83 M), with stock ticking up \~4.7%.
* **Q2 2024** was weak, with EPS at –$0.16 and revenue well below estimates, resulting in a \~3.4% stock drop.

# Strategic Outlook

* **Growth Drivers:** The company's 5G division, specifically its ORAN radios, is the primary growth engine and is responsible for the majority of new orders.
* **Future Projections:** CEO Fawad Maqbool has indicated that Q1 was a ""turning point"" and reiterated the full-year revenue guidance of approximately **$21 million**, which would be more than double the prior year's revenue.
* **Letters of Intent (LOIs):** Amplitech has over **$118 million in signed LOIs**, with **$12 million** already in firm orders for delivery this year. A notable strategic win was a **$78 million LOI** for 5G ORAN radios in March 2025, which is the largest in the company's history.
* **Market Position:** Amplitech operates in the satellite, defense, and telecom sectors. It is one of the few U.S.-based suppliers of fully integrated ORAN radios, which gives it a competitive advantage. The company has also achieved **FCC/CE certifications** for its ORAN radios, enabling global deployment.
* **Overall Assessment:** Amplitech is experiencing strong growth in revenue and its order backlog, while its net losses are shrinking. The company's debt-free balance sheet provides a solid foundation for continued investment in its 5G/ORAN business.

# Q1 2025 Financial Highlights

* **Revenue:** Amplitech reported Q1 2025 revenue of **$3.6 million**, a 57% increase year-over-year. This was driven by growth in its 5G/Open RAN (ORAN) and satellite product lines. Preliminary Q2 2025 results announced in July show revenue of roughly **$11 million**, with the 5G/ORAN division accounting for approximately 75% of sales.
* **Backlog:** The company announced a record order backlog of **$19.6 million** entering Q2, which management stated is the ""highest order backlog in company history.""
* **Profitability:** The company remains unprofitable as it scales up. The **net loss for Q1 2025 was $1.84 million**, a significant improvement from the **$4.66 million loss in Q1 2024**. The company's losses are narrowing as revenue increases.
* **Balance Sheet:** Amplitech's balance sheet is strong, with **$19.1 million in cash and receivables**, **$24.6 million in working capital**, and **zero debt** as of Q1 2025. This is due in part to the repayment of a prior $1.3 million term loan.

Amplitech operates across multiple high-tech segments, with a focus on **telecom, defense, satellite communications, and emerging technologies**:

1. **5G / Open RAN (ORAN) Systems**
   * Fully integrated ORAN radios, FCC & CE certified.
   * Multi-year supply agreements with Tier-1 North American carriers.

   * **$78 M** single LOI signed in March 2025.
   * Preliminary Q2 2025 revenue (\~$11 M) is 75% from ORAN.
2. **RF/Microwave Components**

Summary of $CPSH Post by TraderJoge (@StockRocket1) - Check out the latest on $CPSH (CPS Technologies Corp.), currently at $2.85, with potential to skyrocket to $20.85! This stock has caught my eye after 25 years of trading due to its impressive fundamentals.

Notably, recent insider buys were filed today (see image), with directors and executives purchasing shares, signaling strong confidence. Key highlights include a low 11M float with no dilution, a revolutionary composite matrix material for tech, military, and renewable energy use, and a huge Navy contract. Financials are solid too, with Q2 2025 earnings of $0.01/share (up 114.29% from a loss) and revenue of $8.079M (up 60.62%). Institutional ownership from Vanguard, BlackRock, and Fidelity adds credibility. The 2nd half of 2025 looks promising per guidance. Link to PR: [https://t.co/30vC8prxUP](https://t.co/30vC8prxUP).

1mnj3a2,2025-08-11,"CPSH reaching all time high
I posted last week about CPSH and got some backlash. Solid stock with great earnings results. With a bit more volume and consistency, CPSH will push past its 52 week high of 3.15. 

Cps Technologies (NASDAQ:CPSH), a specialist in advanced metal matrix composite materials for high-performance industrial, electronics, and defense applications, released its Q2 FY2025 financial results on August 1, 2025. The most important takeaway was record revenue, which rose to $8.1 million from $5.0 million (GAAP), alongside a swing back to profitability with earnings per share (GAAP) of $0.01. While analyst estimates were not available for this quarter, these results set new company highs for quarterly sales and reversed last year's GAAP net loss. Margin improvement was also notable in Q1 and Q2, though still below management's targets; leadership identified ongoing operational upgrades as a priority. Overall, the quarter demonstrated strong sales execution, renewed profitability, and continued R&D progress.
Fuxk already at 3.20, worth buying today? How high do you think it could go within 6 months, or to rephrase, is it worth buying in now? Yes buy now. It's a long hold. One government contract which they have 4 in phase I and II will send it. Last time it sent it to 26+.  Just be ready Long term hold for me. I’ll be keeping and buying the dips. This stock will be 5-10x one day based on utility and production. I also post about this. This thing can go with any amount of volume. ! Check mine out my post $CPSH just needs to be talked about I have brotha. Only a few of us but we’ll be ahead when everyone is FOMO in 🥲 CPSH? This is a long hold bro. They are in almost every sector of business. This stock is highly under bought. With such a low market cap there is room to 10X here. Their patented product is in almost every market from oil, aerospace, telecom, satellites, tech, defense, the list goes on. They are technically subcontracted by NVIDIA also as one of their customers is partnered using their products for NVIDIA. 8% today so far. Looks like it’s setting up to scream. Insiders must know something.

Start of marketing. With approval in Europe and the United Kingdom [EXLUSIVITY 10 YEARS 

+ 85% FDA acceptance potential since it has already been approved in Europe and the UK 

It ceases to be a testing company in the biotechnology sector and begins its commercialization, which is why its sales income begins.  

The approval from other continents makes it very difficult for them not to finally accept it in the US.  

A COMPANY that despite all the difficulties finally managed to start its first sales and most importantly with exclusivity so it would have no competition from new drugs. 

If the FED approves, the exclusivity increases to 12 years  

I await your views and opinions, all are welcome as long as correct words are used.
Looks interesting, when are they expected to hear from the FDA? I bought it last week, im pretty excited 08/13: The third quarter results are going to be low because they started 2 months ago and they want to do it well... not in a big way.

08/27 confirmation of the FED's response.

Likewise, distributing in the EU and the United Kingdom is already an achievement at the level of bureaucracy and having exclusivity... the path is good, at least in terms of generating cash flow... I have spent 2 years with accumulation and a good average price... many people are only looking at this month but the more volatility the better... I will look to the future of 1 or 2 years and only with the marketing in the EU and UK... THEY STARTED little by little but it is fine since no problem was reported in the distribution so it is perfect that they are not overcome by ambition and if they do things with logical patience to be able to scale well Got it, thanks!  I’m surprised there hasn’t been an larger increase in share price in the lead up to August 27th

1mmwfvg,2025-08-10,"$WFLD / $LTV: A Geopolitical Catalyst: Why Trump's Tariffs on Swiss Gold Could Be a Game-Changer for Tradewind Markets
Dear investors,

A seismic shift is underway in the global precious metals industry, and it's happening faster than most realize. The recent chaos surrounding potential US tariffs on Swiss gold isn't just another headline; it's a fundamental disruption of a decades-old supply chain. This turmoil exposes the deep-seated vulnerabilities of the traditional gold market and, in doing so, creates what I believe is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for a North American alternative.

Tradewind Markets, through its upcoming RTO, is uniquely positioned to capture the fallout from this disruption. Let's break down why this geopolitical event is such a powerful catalyst.

# 1. The Disruption: Switzerland's Gold Dominance Becomes a Critical Vulnerability

For decades, the world has relied on Switzerland as its primary gold refiner, handling an estimated 34% of the world's total production. This concentration has now become a systemic risk. The threat of a 39% US tariff has sent shockwaves through the market, revealing just how fragile this dependency is.

The panic is justified: Swiss gold exports to the US exploded to **39.2 billion Swiss francs** in the first half of 2025 alone. A tariff of this magnitude would make these trade flows economically unviable, creating a massive supply vacuum and forcing market participants to urgently seek reliable, tariff-free alternatives.

# 2. The Unfair Advantage: The Royal Canadian Mint as a North American Safe Haven

This is where Tradewind's strategic positioning becomes a game-changer. Its exclusive partner and custodian is the **Royal Canadian Mint (RCM)**, and this is not just any partnership. The RCM offers three key advantages that private Swiss refineries cannot match in this environment:

* **Sovereign Backing:** The RCM is a Crown corporation of the Canadian government. In a world of trade wars and uncertainty, this offers an unparalleled level of security and political stability.
* **Geographic Immunity:** All gold custodied at the RCM is located in North America. It is completely insulated from the trade disputes between the US and Switzerland/EU.
* **Supply Chain Integrity:** The RCM refines and custodies the gold itself. This vertical integration eliminates the cross-border risks and transparency issues (such as questionable sourcing) that have begun to plague the Swiss system.

# 3. The Technological Edge: Why Blockchain is the Superior Model

In a crisis, efficiency and transparency are paramount. Tradewind's VaultChain platform, built on blockchain technology, is not a gimmick; it's a superior operating model for this new era.

It directly addresses the market's biggest pain points:

* **Provenance & Transparency:** The platform's ""Tradewind Origins"" feature allows for the tracking of gold from the mine to the vault, providing a direct answer to the growing ethical and sourcing concerns surrounding traditional supply chains.
* **Scalability & Agility:** While building new physical refineries takes years and billions of dollars, Tradewind's digital platform can scale to handle massive increases in trading volume almost instantly. It is built to absorb the redirected trade flows from Switzerland.

# 4. The Strategic Timing: The RTO as a Fully-Funded Launchpad

A crisis is only an opportunity if you have the resources to act. The timing of the RTO is perfect. **It transforms Tradewind into a public company—a strategic move to mobilize capital and seize this unique market opportunity.**

The secured financing of at least **$4 million CAD** is structured intelligently:

* **$2 million is allocated to purchase physical gold**, which serves as collateral for the debentures. This builds a hard asset base and secures trust.
* **$2 million is available for business operations and expansion.** This is the growth capital needed to scale marketing and operations to capture market share from disrupted competitors.

This structure provides both stability and firepower, right when the starting gun has fired.

# 5. The Scale of the Opportunity: A Multi-Billion Dollar Shift

To be clear, this is not a niche opportunity. We are talking about the potential redirection of enormous capital flows. With **39.2 billion Swiss francs** in gold flowing from Switzerland to the US in just six months, even capturing a tiny fraction of this market would be transformative for Tradewind.

The global gold market is valued at approximately **$13 trillion**. The digital gold market is still in its infancy. This tariff disruption is the exact kind of catalyst needed to accelerate the migration from the old, inefficient system to a new, digital, and North American-based standard.

# Summary:

The investment case for the Tradewind RTO has just been fundamentally strengthened by external, geopolitical forces. We are witnessing a perfect storm: a crisis in the traditional supply chain, a superior North American solution with sovereign backing (RCM), a technologically advanced platform ready to scale, and a well-structured RTO providing the necessary capital.

This is no longer just a story about technology; it's a story about becoming a critical piece of North America's precious metals infrastructure at the precise moment it is most needed.

Best regards,

TradeToday

**PS:** The market is often slow to connect the dots between geopolitical events and the valuation of a micro-cap stock. This disconnect between the magnitude of this opportunity and the current share price is where the potential lies for informed and patient investors. This is a fundamental catalyst, not speculation.

*I've spent the last few days deep-diving into the implications of these potential tariffs, and the more I analyze the situation, the clearer the opportunity becomes. It feels like watching a strategic chess game where a single move suddenly changes the entire board in Tradewind's favor.*

Quick note to the community:

I’d really appreciate some feedback on my recent posts about Wellfield Technologies and Tradewind. Based on the current up- or downvotes, it’s hard to tell whether it makes sense to keep sharing my insights here, or if I should just stick to posting them in my two Reddit forums. Those are currently set up as pure information hubs, since I don’t have the time to actively moderate them - my work and all the other exciting companies and hobbies I’m involved with keep me pretty busy.

If you have thoughts, feel free to send me a PM instead of voting. I’d genuinely appreciate hearing from you directly.

# Deutsche Version:

# $WFLD / $LTV: Ein geopolitischer Katalysator: Warum Trumps Zölle auf Schweizer Gold ein Game-Changer für Tradewind Markets sein könnten

Liebe Investoren,

in der globalen Edelmetallbranche vollzieht sich ein seismischer Wandel, und er geschieht schneller, als die meisten realisieren. Das jüngste Chaos um mögliche US-Zölle auf Schweizer Gold ist nicht nur eine weitere Schlagzeile; es ist eine fundamentale Erschütterung einer jahrzehntealten Lieferkette. Diese Turbulenzen legen die tiefgreifenden Schwachstellen des traditionellen Goldmarktes offen und schaffen dadurch, so meine Überzeugung, eine einmalige Chance für eine nordamerikanische Alternative.

Tradewind Markets ist durch den bevorstehenden RTO einzigartig positioniert, um die Folgen dieser Disruption aufzufangen. Lasst uns analysieren, warum dieses geopolitische Ereignis ein so starker Katalysator ist.

# 1. Die Disruption: Die Gold-Dominanz der Schweiz wird zur kritischen Schwachstelle

Jahrzehntelang hat sich die Welt auf die Schweiz als Haupt-Goldraffinerie verlassen, die schätzungsweise 34 % der weltweiten Gesamtproduktion verarbeitet. Diese Konzentration ist nun zu einem systemischen Risiko geworden. Die Androhung eines US-Zolls von 39 % hat Schockwellen durch den Markt gesendet und offenbart, wie fragil diese Abhängigkeit ist.

Die Panik ist gerechtfertigt: Die Schweizer Goldexporte in die USA explodierten allein im ersten Halbjahr 2025 auf **39,2 Milliarden Schweizer Franken**. Ein Zoll dieser Höhe würde diese Handelsströme wirtschaftlich unrentabel machen, ein massives Angebotsvakuum schaffen und die Marktteilnehmer zwingen, dringend nach zuverlässigen, zollfreien Alternativen zu suchen.

# 2. Der unfaire Vorteil: Die Royal Canadian Mint als nordamerikanischer sicherer Hafen

Hier wird die strategische Positionierung von Tradewind zum Game-Changer. Sein exklusiver Partner und Verwahrer ist die **Royal Canadian Mint (RCM)**, und dies ist nicht nur irgendeine Partnerschaft. Die RCM bietet drei entscheidende Vorteile, die private Schweizer Raffinerien in diesem Umfeld nicht bieten können:

* **Staatliche Rückendeckung:** Die RCM ist ein staatliches Unternehmen (Crown Corporation) der kanadischen Regierung. In einer Welt von Handelskriegen und Unsicherheit bietet dies ein unübertroffenes Maß an Sicherheit und politischer Stabilität.
* **Geografische Immunität:** Alles bei der RCM verwahrte Gold befindet sich in Nordamerika. Es ist vollständig von den Handelsstreitigkeiten zwischen den USA und der Schweiz/EU isoliert.
* **Integrität der Lieferkette:** Die RCM raffiniert und verwahrt das Gold selbst. Diese vertikale Integration eliminiert die grenzüberschreitenden Risiken und Transparenzprobleme (wie fragwürdige Herkunft), die das Schweizer System zunehmend belasten.

# 3. Der technologische Vorsprung: Warum Blockchain das überlegene Modell ist

In einer Krise sind Effizienz und Transparenz von größter Bedeutung. Die VaultChain-Plattform von Tradewind, die auf Blockchain-Technologie basiert, ist keine Spielerei; sie ist ein überlegenes Betriebsmodell für diese neue Ära.

Sie adressiert direkt die größten Schmerzpunkte des Marktes:

* **Herkunft & Transparenz:** Die ""Tradewind Origins""-Funktion der Plattform ermöglicht die Nachverfolgung des Goldes von der Mine bis zum Tresor und liefert eine direkte Antwort auf die wachsenden ethischen Bedenken und Herkunftsfragen im Zusammenhang mit traditionellen Lieferketten.
* **Skalierbarkeit & Agilität:** Während der Bau neuer physischer Raffinerien Jahre und Milliarden von Dollar kostet, kann die digitale Plattform von Tradewind fast augenblicklich skalieren, um massive Zunahmen des Handelsvolumens zu bewältigen. Sie ist darauf ausgelegt, die umgeleiteten Handelsströme aus der Schweiz aufzunehmen.

# 4. Das strategische Timing: Der RTO als voll finanzierte Startrampe

Eine Krise ist nur dann eine Chance, wenn man die Mittel hat, zu handeln. Das Timing des RTO ist perfekt. **Er verwandelt Tradewind in ein börsennotiertes Unternehmen – ein strategischer Schritt, um Kapital zu mobilisieren und die einmalige Marktchance zu nutzen.**

Die gesicherte Finanzierung von mindestens **4 Millionen CAD** ist intelligent strukturiert:

* **2 Millionen CAD sind für den Kauf von physischem Gold vorgesehen**, das als Sicherheit für die Wandelanleihen dient. Dies schafft eine solide Vermögensbasis und sichert Vertrauen.
* **2 Millionen CAD stehen für den Geschäftsbetrieb und die Expansion zur Verfügung.** Dies ist das Wachstumskapital, das benötigt wird, um Marketing und Betrieb zu skalieren und Marktanteile von den gestörten Wettbewerbern zu gewinnen.

Diese Struktur bietet sowohl Stabilität als auch Schlagkraft, genau zum Zeitpunkt des Startschusses.

# 5. Die Dimension der Chance: Eine Multi-Milliarden-Dollar-Verschiebung

Um es klar zu sagen: Dies ist keine Nischen-Chance. Wir sprechen über die potenzielle Umleitung von enormen Kapitalströmen. Mit Gold im Wert von **39,2 Milliarden Schweizer Franken**, das in nur sechs Monaten von der Schweiz in die USA floss, wäre selbst die Eroberung eines winzigen Bruchteils dieses Marktes für Tradewind transformativ.

Der globale Goldmarkt hat einen Wert von etwa **13 Billionen US-Dollar**. Der digitale Goldmarkt steckt noch in den Kinderschuhen. Diese Zoll-Disruption ist genau der Katalysator, der notwendig ist, um die Migration vom alten, ineffizienten System zu einem neuen, digitalen und in Nordamerika ansässigen Standard zu beschleunigen.

# Zusammenfassung:

Die Investment-These für den Tradewind-RTO wurde soeben durch externe, geopolitische Kräfte fundamental gestärkt. Wir erleben einen perfekten Sturm: eine Krise in der traditionellen Lieferkette, eine überlegene nordamerikanische Lösung mit staatlicher Rückendeckung (RCM), eine technologisch fortschrittliche Plattform, die zur Skalierung bereit ist, und ein gut strukturierter RTO, der das notwendige Kapital bereitstellt.

Dies ist nicht mehr nur eine Geschichte über Technologie; es ist eine Geschichte darüber, ein entscheidender Teil der nordamerikanischen Edelmetallinfrastruktur zu werden, und zwar genau in dem Moment, in dem sie am dringendsten gebraucht wird.

Beste Grüße

TradeToday

**PS:** Der Markt ist oft langsam darin, die Verbindung zwischen geopolitischen Ereignissen und der Bewertung einer Micro-Cap-Aktie herzustellen. In dieser Diskrepanz zwischen dem Ausmaß dieser Chance und dem aktuellen Aktienkurs liegt das Potenzial für informierte und geduldige Investoren. Dies ist ein fundamentaler Katalysator, keine Spekulation.

*Ich habe die letzten Tage damit verbracht, mich intensiv mit den Auswirkungen dieser potenziellen Zölle zu befassen, und je mehr ich die Situation analysiere, desto klarer wird die Chance. Es fühlt sich an, als würde man ein strategisches Schachspiel beobachten, bei dem ein einziger Zug plötzlich das gesamte Brett zugunsten von Tradewind verändert.*

1mml62l,2025-08-10,"$PSTV – New NCCN Guidelines Just Matched PSTV’s Playbook Step-for-Step
$PSTV – NCCN Just Changed the Rulebook, and PSTV Is the Only Player in This Lane

What happened:
On June 3, 2025, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) released Version 1.2025 of its guidelines for Adult Intracranial and Spinal Ependymomas (Excluding Subependymomas).

For the first time, the follow-up/recurrence pathway now includes:

“CSF–tDNA testing can be considered with CSF cytology to increase sensitivity of tumor cell detection and assessment of residual disease after surgery.”

This wasn’t in prior public 2024 versions — meaning June 3, 2025 is the first official inclusion for this tumor category.

⸻

Why it matters for PSTV:
	•	PSTV’s Rhenium-186 nanoliposome therapy is delivered directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to treat leptomeningeal metastases and other CNS cancers.
	•	CSF–tDNA testing is essentially a “liquid biopsy” of spinal fluid — it finds microscopic traces of tumor DNA.
	•	NCCN now officially recommends this testing to detect residual disease and monitor recurrence.
	•	PSTV’s therapy works in the exact environment this new guideline is targeting — the “test + treat” model is now backed by NCCN.

⸻

First-mover advantage:
PSTV is the only clinical-stage company with this specific combination:
	•	Radiotherapeutic payload (Rhenium-186)
	•	Nanoliposome delivery system
	•	Direct CSF administration for CNS cancers

Other companies may do CSF diagnostics or intrathecal delivery of chemo, but nobody else is combining a targeted radiotherapy with nanoliposome delivery into the CSF.

⸻

Why this is bullish:
	1.	Guideline validation – The testing method that perfectly complements PSTV’s drug delivery is now officially recommended.
	2.	Adoption pathway – Hospitals love treatments that align with guidelines; it smooths approval and reimbursement.
	3.	Better trial metrics – CSF–tDNA gives a measurable way to track PSTV’s effectiveness.
	4.	Market readiness – The rulebook now supports exactly what PSTV is building — before they’ve even commercialized.

⸻

Bottom line:
June 3, 2025, NCCN made a formal change that lands squarely in PSTV’s sweet spot. They are the only player with this tech, and now the standard of care is aligning with their strategy.

1mlcfif,2025-08-09,"$PSTV – FDA Clearance, Texas Rollout, Sustained Volume, and Aug 14–16 Conference
$PSTV has been drawing unusual attention lately, combining confirmed company developments with heavy trading activity and an upcoming scheduled catalyst.

 Aug 14–16 – SNO/ASCO CNS Metastases Conference
PSTV is confirmed to present:
	•	Two CNSide® Presentations – Data on detecting and quantifying tumor cells in cerebrospinal fluid for leptomeningeal metastases (LM), including breast cancer and NSCLC patients.
	•	REYOBIQ™ Phase 1/2 Trial Update – Safety and efficacy results for LM.
	•	Educational Symposium – “Reimagining Your Approach to LM”, featuring leading neuro-oncologists discussing CNSide and REYOBIQ.
	•	CNSide’s rollout into Texas hospitals is expected to be part of the discussion — a notable early commercial step in a major medical market.

 Volume & Float
	•	Float: ~60M shares.
	•	June 24: 121M shares traded (~2× float) after cancelling potential issuance of up to 1.5B warrant-linked shares, removing a large dilution overhang.
	•	June 25: 741M shares traded (~12× float) the day after FDA IND clearance for REYOBIQ™ in childhood brain cancer.
	•	This week (Aug 4–8): 126.6M shares traded (~2× float) as the conference approaches.
	•	Accumulation Observation: Over the past five trading days, more than 126 million shares have traded — over twice the float — with a large portion of that activity occurring between roughly $0.62 and $0.90. Sustained, high-volume trading in a defined range often points to strong interest from committed holders rather than short-term flipping.

 Price Action
	•	+126% in the past month.
	•	+60% this week.
	•	Daily multi-million share volume with consistent churn.

Why It Stands Out
Recently, PSTV has:
	1.	Removed a multi-billion-share dilution threat.
	2.	Received FDA clearance for a high-need cancer therapy IND.
	3.	Begun rolling out CNSide in Texas hospitals.

With the Aug 14–16 conference ahead, the company has a defined platform to present clinical and commercial updates to both the medical community and investors.

Bottom Line:
PSTV has the float, the volume history, and recent trading pattern to support a potential move if upcoming presentations resonate. With multiple confirmed developments and a catalyst just days away, it’s a setup worth watching closely.

GLTA invested! 
Respectfully, if it was already FDA approved, it wouldn't be a pennystock. I am personally going long on this stock. It has the potential to run hard once key catalysts hit. Analysts are predicting an average target near $10 — lol, I’m parking my 50k shares, setting my alerts, and not looking back! And honestly, when I think about it, I just hope that somewhere down the line this drug helps someone who truly needs it. If backing the company helps bring it to market, then I’m helping too, right? One could only hope! Vs being a shorter and hoping to drive this.potentially life saving Bio company into the ground! In my honest opinion that is just very bad karma! I would rather sleep well at night thank you very much! Peace out! 2000 shares in.  Hoping for a pop during that conference been in since .30, up 125%. easily gonna break 52 week high in coming weeks Was it approved for cancer treatments I might be looking to positively but this is the first major step in bringing REYOBIQ™ to market , and it’s now in motion. REYOBIQ™ is not FDA-approved for cancer treatment yet.

It’s currently an investigational therapy in Phase 1/2 clinical trials for leptomeningeal metastases (a complication of certain cancers).
	•	The FDA IND clearance they received allows them to run these human trials in the U.S.
	•	IND clearance is not the same as full approval for commercial cancer treatment — that only comes after successful trials and a formal New Drug Application review. Lesss gooo If you are going to mention PSTV, you should also tell others that there is a risk of 2:1 reverse split if the catalyst fails to bring the stock to 1 dollar and keep it 1 dollar for nasdaq compliance. Going in at any price above 80 cents is a substantial risk in my opinion. At least the low split ratio of 2:1 shows the confidence that the company has that it won't drop below 50 cents no matter what before the compliance due date, but that only means people who invested when this company was below 50 cents are safe for the upcoming catalysts. Be sure to set stop losses if you are going to go in to pstv. Time will tell for sure we’ll see!

Summary

Upgrading Tilray Brands to Buy due to improved valuation, net cash position, and technical support near recent lows, despite ongoing volatility and sector headwinds.
Q4 results showed mixed performance: revenue missed expectations but adjusted EBITDA beat; cannabis margins improved, though overall growth remains challenging.
Valuation is attractive, trading below tangible book value and at under 10x FY26 projected adjusted EBITDA, limiting downside risk versus peers.
Key risks include potential reverse split, further M&A, and regulatory uncertainty in U.S. THC beverages, but risk/reward now favors a Buy rating on TLRY stock. I was not a fan of the stock of Tilray Brands (NASDAQ:TLRY) (TSX:TLRY:CA) for a long time, and it finally fell a ton. I upgraded it to Neutral too early in December at $1.19, and then, after it fell further, I upgraded it to Buy too early in February at $0.93. I upgraded it to Strong Buy in March, when it was $0.61. The stock is now below that level, but I stuck with it all the way down to an all-time low set in June at $0.35.
TLRY rallied very big after that all-time low, and I downgraded the stock to Neutral on July 10th, when the stock was $0.67. In that article, I disclosed that my model portfolio at 420 Investor had a 4.6% position, which was below its weight in the index I aim to beat, the New Cannabis Ventures Global Cannabis Stock Index. After the article, the stock, which was at $0.69 when I was writing it, traded above $0.80 on July 23rd. I ended up exiting the position from my model portfolio on 7/14 at a price of $0.628 to add to another Canadian LP.

As I discuss below, TLRY has been very volatile. Today, I want to discuss why I bought it back in the model portfolio this past week after it reported its fiscal Q4 financials. It is currently 11.7% of the model portfolio, the 4th largest of 8 positions. The index weighting for TLRY is 5.6%, so I am overweight the stock relative to the index. I currently hold three Canadian LPs that total 35.4% of the portfolio versus a 32.8% Canadian LP exposure in the index across 7 names.

The TLRY Chart Suggests a Low Was Set

TLRY is currently down 57.2% in 2025 so far, while the Global Cannabis Stock Index has dropped 22.1%. Here are the last six months of trading, which includes the fiscal Q3 report on April 8th and this past week's Q4 report:

This week, the stock gapped down after the earnings were released, setting a low of the week on that day of $0.551, which was matched on Friday. $0.55 seems to me to be support, but there is a lot of room below. Interestingly, this is where the stock was right before it reported its Q3. My second support of $0.50 is not only a nice round number but also where the rising 50-day moving average currently is. On the resistance, my first level is $0.70, which is above the gap and right at the falling 150-day moving average.

Taking a longer-term perspective, the big loss this year follows a big loss from the peak set right after the IPO:

The stock is 96.7% below the $17 IPO price and more than 99% below its all-time high.

While the 71.4% loss over the past year for TLRY is huge, it is not the worst performance. Canopy Growth (CGC), which I do not like at all, has dropped by 84.5%. All of the other LPs are down except for Village Farms (VFF), which just joined the index at the end of June. The two other LPs that I include in my model portfolio are the best performers of the remaining stocks in the index, which has declined by 40.2% during that timeframe.

Tilray's Q4 Had Some Positives

The company was expected, according to Koyfin, to have revenue in Q4 of $233.3 million with adjusted EBITDA of $23.7 million. It reported through a press release that revenue was below this level at $224.5 million, down 2% from a year earlier. Adjusted EBITDA exceeded expectations at $27.6 million, down 6%.

Before I discuss the report in more detail, I want to point out that the report looks really bad compared to a year ago, but I thought the report a year ago was too high when it was reported, as I discussed in early September. In that article, which had a Strong Sell rating for the stock, which was then $1.66, I pointed out that M&A was driving the overall growth and was likely not sustainable.

Looking at Q4 closer, revenue fell despite M&A. Again, I think the company does a poor job of disclosing its organic growth. The company has four segments. I have been most interested in its cannabis segment, and in Q4 it was the second-largest segment with revenue of 30% that fell 6% from a year earlier. It breaks down cannabis revenue by business, and Canadian medical cannabis fell slightly and represented 9% of cannabis revenue. Net revenue for adult use represented 55% of cannabis sales, and it fell 6% from a year earlier. Wholesale was just 3% of cannabis sales and plunged 83%. The company did see a gain in its international cannabis, which grew 71% and represented 33% of cannabis sales.

Looking at the other 70% of revenue, the beverage business, at 29% of revenue, experienced a decline of 14%, and this was increased by an acquisition. Its pharmaceutical distribution business, at 32% of revenue, grew 10%, though it has a very low margin. The fourth business, hemp for wellness, and at 8% of overall revenue, grew 10% too.

The company does not give operating profits by segment, though it does share gross profits by division. Its reported gross margin in cannabis was 44%, and its beverage gross margin was 38%. The cannabis gross margin increased from 40% a year earlier, while the beverage gross margin fell sharply from 53%. The distribution gross margin was flat at 12%, while the small hemp wellness products improved from 31% to 33%.

For the full year, gross margin for TLRY was reported at 29%, up from 28% in FY24. On an adjusted basis for price-accounting step-ups, gross margin fell from 30% to 29%. By operating segment, cannabis fell from 36% to 33%, beverage fell from 46% to 39%, distribution was flat at 11%, and hemp wellness rose from 30% to 32%.

In fiscal Q4, the company reported a use of cash of $12.8 million, which was in stark contrast to the generation of $30.7 million in FY24-Q4. This looks bad, but it accounts for most of the change in full-year operating cash flow, which deteriorated by $63.6 million to -$94.6 million.

As I pointed out in my bullish articles previously, the company has substantially reduced debt. The press release and the 10-K showed that total debt ended Q4 at $256.9 million, slightly higher than the cash and marketable securities at $256.4 million. Well, looking at the 10-K, it is apparent that the company now has net cash of $14.8 million.

How did the company, which is using cash in its operations, get to a position of net cash? The sale of stock! During the quarter, it sold more stock through its A-T-M program. For the year, it sold shares to raise $161.2 million (an average net price during FY25 of $1.15 per share). It issued stock during the year to pay off debt too. Its 10-K reveals that in June, which is part of FY26, it has issued 12.6 million shares to pay off $5 million of convertible debt and has sold 25.7 million shares for net $10.3 million. These shares were included in the share count reported by the company.

I am not sure if it matters much, but the CEO and the CFO who bought stock after the report seem to agree. CEO Irwin Simon bought 165K shares at $0.6067, and CFO Carl Merton added 33.5K shares at $0.5952.

The Outlook for TLRY Is Strong

Going into the report, analysts were expecting total revenue of $875.3 million in FY26 and then $918.6 million in FY27. For adjusted EBITDA, they were projecting $72.3 million in FY26 and then $93.9 million. In a preview for my 420 Investor members, I shared my view that the adjusted EBITDA outlook was too high and built my price targets on adjusted EBITDA of $65.6 million for FY26 and then $73.5 million for FY27. Those were based on margins of 7.5% and then 8.0%.

Currently, analysts project that FY26 revenue will increase 5% to $863.9 million, which is 1% lower than their prior outlook. Adjusted EBITDA is currently projected at $68.2 million, a margin of 7.9% and up 24%. EPS is projected to be $0.04. For FY27, they project revenue will increase 4% to $902.1 million with adjusted EBITDA up 26% to $85.8 million. This is a projected adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.5%. EPS is projected at $0.06.

I think projecting revenue for TLRY is very difficult, and like that, the revenue projections aren't down substantially despite the miss in Q4. I continue to view the adjusted EBITDA margins as perhaps too aggressive. Tilray Brands had stopped giving adjusted EBITDA outlooks, but it did share an internal projection for FY26 of $62-72 million. Again, I am looking for about a 7.5% margin, which would be $64.8 million, which is below the current consensus. For FY27, my 8% would be $72.2 million. Note that the adjusted EBITDA in FY25 was $55.0 million, down 9% and a margin of 6.7%.

TLRY Has a Good Valuation

When I downgraded TLRY in July, I pointed out that it was trading at a price to tangible book value of 1.2X, but it is currently lower. The price fell, which helps, but the tangible book value increased. The stock trades at just 0.9X. For a company that has no net debt, trading at a discount to tangible book value suggests downside risk being limited. With that said, the company does have debt still and sees its tangible book value decline.

A better way to assess the valuation is to look at its enterprise value to projected adjusted EBITDA. With a market cap of $643 million, it has an enterprise value of $628 million and is trading at less than 10X FY26 adjusted EBITDA projections, which seems low. Based on the FY26 projected EPS, it trades at just 14PE.

I cover TLRY and four of its peers. Here is the table that I shared yesterday for the five companies based on year-end 2026 estimates:

All 5 of these companies trade below tangible book value, and only CGC has net debt. Cronos Group (CRON), which I own in the model portfolio, has negative enterprise value, with its cash higher than its market cap. TLRY, trading at 7.8X, has the highest enterprise value to projected calendar 2026 adjusted EBITDA, but it does not seem out of line with its peers.

As I discussed above, I am using lower adjusted EBITDA numbers than the analysts are predicting. In my July 10th article, I shared a one-year target of $0.90 based on 10X. I am now using 12X for this federally legal company, but the higher share count and lower adjusted EBITDA level suggest $0.78 for a year from now. Based on the EPS estimate, this would be 13PE. An enterprise value to projected adjusted EBITDA of 10X would be $0.65, which is up 14%.

Risks to TLRY

Tilray has some good things working for it, but there are risks. First, while I don't see any risk to doing a reverse split, many investors and traders don't like reverse splits. TLRY will need to do one to avoid being delisted by the NASDAQ.

As I have discussed before, TLRY, which has done a lot of M&A, could do more acquisitions. This action could be positive, but it could also degrade the balance sheet. Further, it could do a bad acquisition.

Finally, while I am excited about the potential for the company in THC beverages in the U.S., some states are pushing back. Further, there is a risk that the federal government takes action that could hurt the category as well. While the company does not disclose its sales levels of these products, wiping them out could hurt future growth.

Conclusion

As I discussed above, TLRY is a volatile stock. It is also a large cannabis company that has been historically popular with traders and investors. There are 138K followers at . For those who want to be invested in cannabis, I think TLRY is one of the better ideas now and am upgrading my rating from Neutral to Buy.

Again, the chart is looking better, and the valuation looks attractive. Importantly, the company has moved to net cash from net debt. While the price is much lower than it was when I first gave it a Strong Buy and somewhat lower than where I downgraded it to Neutral, it is up a lot from the recent low. I shared a target that would represent a 37% gain over the next year. Good enough for Buy but not good enough for Strong Buy!

Trump just said something about cannabis like an hour ago. I'm heavily invested in TLRY for a couple years now and... Well, let's just say I'm holding and hoping. Shitray It went to 1.13 currently good job on the research Has anyone been pumping $SNDL too? I hope not, pumping TLRY and SNDL are 2 of the signs of the marketacolypse Yeah, reclassified as less dangerous but doesn't mean legalised

# Signals for PRGN-2012’s FDA Decision – Recent Sentiment & Market Indicators

# Analyst Sentiment & Target Price Changes

**Strong Bullish Consensus:** Wall Street analysts covering Precigen (PGEN) have been notably optimistic in recent weeks. The stock carries a *Buy/Outperform* consensus, and several analysts have reiterated or raised their targets ahead of the FDA decision:

* **Stifel:** Reiterated a Buy rating and raised their price target to **$10** (from $7) after positive PRGN-2012 trial data . This bullish target reflects high confidence in approval and market potential.
* **JMP Securities:** Recently **reaffirmed a “Market Outperform”** rating with a **$6.00** price target, citing optimism about PRGN-2012’s prospects .
* **Cantor Fitzgerald:** Maintains an **Overweight** rating (previous target around $7) , remaining positive on the stock.
* *Consensus:* The average analyst target now sits in the **$6–7** range, which implies a **200–300%+ upside** from the current \~$1.8 share price . This bullish consensus suggests that analysts largely **expect FDA approval**, as such upside would likely materialize only if PRGN-2012 reaches the market successfully. Notably, one data point even shows a prior “sell” rating being upgraded to “hold” in July – indicating that even the more skeptical observers have turned neutral or positive as the review progresses. No analysts have issued new downgrades or negative reports in the last few weeks. Overall, Wall Street sentiment points toward **confidence in approval** (and significant commercial value), with little evidence of analyst pessimism.

# Institutional Investor & Insider Movements

**Smart Money Positioning:** Recent ownership moves suggest that both insiders and some institutional investors are positioning for a favorable outcome. Key signals include:

* **High Insider Ownership:** Precigen’s insiders (management and directors) collectively hold over **50%** of the stock – a very large stake that aligns insiders’ interests with shareholders. This includes founder Randal J. Kirk, who alone owns roughly half the company. Insider ownership has even ticked up slightly in 2025 (e.g. minor increases from stock grants) . Crucially, there have been *no significant insider sales* ahead of the FDA decision. In fact, one board director **exercised options to acquire \~126,760 shares in early July** (at effectively $0 cost) , increasing her holding. The CEO and other top executives were likewise granted stock and options in June and have retained them . This lack of selling – and continued insider holding – is generally interpreted as a **positive signal** that those closest to the company are optimistic (insiders typically would avoid buying or would sell down if they anticipated a negative outcome).
* **Institutional Accumulation:** While PGEN is a small-cap, several biotech-focused funds have modest positions that they’ve recently increased. For example, Adage Capital Partners (a prominent healthcare hedge fund) holds about **11.3 million shares** (\~3.8% of PGEN) as of Q1 2025 . Adage slightly **added** to its stake in that quarter , a sign of growing conviction. Other institutions like **BlackRock** and **Vanguard** also upped their holdings by a few hundred thousand shares each in late 2024/early 2025 . Total institutional ownership has climbed to roughly **27–33%** of the float , up from previous levels (Finviz notes a +7.3% increase in institutional positions recently) . The fact that major biotech investors and index funds are not cutting exposure – and indeed some are buying – in the lead-up to the PDUFA suggests **expectations of approval** (or at least a lack of serious concern about rejection). It’s also worth noting that Precigen raised **$79 million in new financing** at the end of 2024 to secure its cash runway through an anticipated 2025 launch . This capital raise was led in part by insiders (including Randal Kirk) and supportive investors. It indicates confidence in PRGN-2012, and it means the company likely **won’t need to dilute shareholders again before the FDA decision**, reducing a risk that often concerns institutions.
* **No Bearish Insider Signals:** There have been no Form-4 filings in recent weeks suggesting insider selling or cautious moves. On the contrary, insiders appear to be “all in” on PRGN-2012’s success. High insider ownership (roughly **61% per some estimates** when including insider-affiliated entities) has been highlighted by investors as a bullish factor – management’s fortunes are tied to the drug’s outcome. All of this implies that those with the most knowledge have **not signaled any red flags**; if anything, their actions convey optimism and commitment.

# Biotech Forums & Expert Speculation

**Buzz in Biotech Communities:** In online biotech investor communities, **speculation is running high** that PRGN-2012 will secure FDA approval – and possibly attract big-pharma interest. While informal, these discussions provide insight into market sentiment among dedicated investors and even industry consultants:

* On Reddit’s biotech and penny stock forums, some users have been extremely bullish. One detailed post called Precigen *“the sleeper biotech of 2025”* and noted the **“asymmetric upside”** of the August PDUFA catalyst . The author pointed to PRGN-2012’s game-changing potential in a rare disease and the stock’s low valuation, arguing that a positive outcome could rerate the stock dramatically. In fact, **retail bulls have floated astronomical upside scenarios** – for instance, a discussion thread speculated on “**1400% potential**” upside and a possible *“bidding war”* for Precigen if PRGN-2012 is approved . (Such outsized figures assume that if PRGN-2012 becomes the first approved therapy for RRP, larger biopharma companies might vie to acquire Precigen for its platform and revenue potential.) This is admittedly **hyperbolic**, but it underscores the *excitement* in some quarters.
* **Merck Involvement Rumors:** Notably, that same Reddit discussion highlighted that **Merck** (the pharma giant) reportedly owns **\~8%** of Precigen . This appears to refer to a historical equity stake – indeed, Merck KGaA had a partnership with Precigen’s predecessor and took an equity position years ago. If Merck or its affiliates still hold a significant stake, forum commenters see it as a sign that *“Big Pharma is watching.”* Some speculate Merck could be a logical commercial partner or acquirer if PRGN-2012 is approved. While this is informal chatter, the idea that a major pharma has a foot in the door adds to positive sentiment (investors often view strategic pharma stakes as votes of confidence). It’s also been noted that **insider/founder Randal Kirk has a history of selling companies** (he previously sold Intrexon’s energy business and other ventures) – fueling talk that a *buyout could follow approval* if the data and market look compelling.
* **Regulatory Experts’ Views:** On platforms like **Twitter (X)** and investor conferences, biotech regulatory consultants have weighed in more pragmatically. The consensus of those watching the FDA seems to be that **there is no obvious reason for rejection** at this stage. PRGN-2012 addresses a serious unmet need (no approved therapies for RRP) and showed strong efficacy (50%+ complete response rate) with benign safety in trials. Some experts have noted that the FDA **rarely denies approval to a Breakthrough-designated therapy** with a positive pivotal trial in a rare disease – unless there are manufacturing or safety issues. As one poster put it, *“What’s the bear case? The data are great, the patients have no alternatives.”* The main caution they raise is *CMC (Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls)* considerations, which can trip up gene therapies. However, **Precigen’s public communications give no indication of CMC trouble** – quite the opposite, as discussed below, the company claims to be ready on the manufacturing front. Thus, the qualitative sentiment from knowledgeable observers skews **optimistic**: most believe the FDA is inclined to approve PRGN-2012, barring an unforeseen issue. In sum, the biotech community buzz is that Precigen is on the cusp of a breakthrough, and many are positioning accordingly (though a few skeptics urge caution until the FDA’s letter is in hand).

# FDA Review Patterns & Regulatory Signals

**Clues from the FDA Process:** Several subtle signals in the regulatory review process itself point toward a likely approval for PRGN-2012:

* **No Advisory Committee Meeting:** The FDA did **not convene an advisory committee (AdCom)** to review PRGN-2012 . In Precigen’s press release and conference calls, they confirmed that *“the FDA has indicated they are not planning to hold an advisory committee meeting”* for this BLA . Skipping an AdCom is often interpreted as a *green flag*. Typically, the FDA calls an external expert panel when there are significant questions on safety, efficacy, or trial design that warrant public discussion. The absence of an AdCom suggests the agency saw **no major controversies or deficiencies** in Precigen’s data package that required outside input. While not a guarantee, this usually means the review is proceeding smoothly. (For context, in recent years the FDA has increasingly foregone AdComs for many approvals – by 2021, only \~6% of drug approvals went to an AdCom – but for a first-in-class gene therapy, *having no AdCom is a positive sign* that the FDA isn’t raising red flags.)
* **Priority Review & Breakthrough Status:** PRGN-2012 was granted **Breakthrough Therapy** designation and received **Priority Review**, with a 6-month review clock and an **August 27, 2025 PDUFA date** . These designations signal that the FDA considers the therapy to offer a major advance for a serious condition. Priority Review shortens the timeline and implies the FDA will devote resources to expedite the decision. In practice, drugs with these statuses have a higher likelihood of approval, as the FDA has essentially agreed the drug addresses an *unmet need*. The fact that the FDA did *not* extend the review timeline or announce any delays so far indicates the review is on track.
* **Regulatory Alignment on Data Requirements:** Precigen’s management has repeatedly emphasized that they designed the PRGN-2012 clinical program *in close consultation with the FDA*. The pivotal Phase 1/2 trial’s primary endpoint (proportion of patients with complete response – i.e., no surgeries needed for 12+ months) was **prospectively defined and agreed upon with FDA input** . Importantly, the trial met this primary efficacy endpoint with highly significant results: a **51% complete response rate** versus the pre-specified success threshold (which was lower) . All complete responders remained surgery-free, with responses durable out to 3 years in many cases . Because the endpoint and required effect size were set in alignment with FDA, *hitting those marks bodes very well* – it suggests Precigen delivered exactly what regulators asked for to deem the drug effective. In essence, PRGN-2012 checked the efficacy box convincingly, and the FDA was already on board with the trial design.
* **Accelerated Approval Path & Confirmatory Trial:** The FDA appears open to granting **accelerated approval** for PRGN-2012 based on the Phase 2 data. Precigen has disclosed that, at the FDA’s guidance, they **initiated a confirmatory Phase 3 trial** in parallel, even before approval . Notably, the confirmatory trial design is *quite favorable*: it’s **single-arm (no placebo)**, targeting \~35 additional patients . This implies the FDA did *not* require a large randomized Phase 3 before approval – a huge indicator of confidence. A single-arm confirmatory study is usually used only when the FDA is already convinced by existing data and just needs more safety or durability information post-approval. The fact that enrollment is ongoing and no placebo control is needed shows the FDA likely agrees there’s no ethical equipoise (since surgery vs. drug is not a true “placebo” comparison – the drug’s benefit is clear enough). In summary, the regulatory pathway (rolling BLA submission, priority review, small confirmatory study) strongly suggests that **FDA is favorably disposed to approve now** under accelerated approval, with final confirmation of benefits to come from that follow-up study .
* **Manufacturing & CMC Preparedness:** A common pitfall for gene therapies can be chemistry/manufacturing issues, which sometimes lead to FDA **Complete Response Letters (CRLs)** even for efficacious drugs. However, Precigen has signaled that it has its manufacturing in order. In a recent earnings call, the COO detailed their preparations: Precigen built an **in-house GMP manufacturing facility** for the adenovirus-based product back in 2019 and has already produced all clinical supply there . The facility was **upgraded for commercial production** and process validation has been **completed in alignment with FDA requirements** . They also enlisted a reputable contract manufacturer for final fill-finish steps . Precigen stated they are *“confident in \[their\] ability to supply PRGN-2012 to meet anticipated demand at launch”* . This is a significant de-risking: it suggests that by the time of the BLA submission, Precigen had met the FDA’s CMC expectations (they even noted all required validation data were in the BLA). **No news of manufacturing deficiencies** has emerged during the review – usually, if there were CMC issues, the company might have signaled delays or the FDA might have convened an expert panel. Instead, silence on this front and the company’s bullish statements imply that **CMC is unlikely to derail approval**. This aligns with FDA’s broader push to facilitate gene therapy approvals; the agency has beefed up its review staff for gene therapies and indicated back in 2019 that by 2025 it expects to approve **10–20 cell/gene therapies per year** . All signs indicate PRGN-2012 could be one of those, given that it seems to satisfy the FDA’s efficacy and manufacturing standards so far.

In summary, the regulatory **tea leaves read positive**: a cooperative FDA, no advisory panel, and an approval pathway clearly laid out. These factors strongly hint that an FDA *green light* is more likely than not.

# Market Trading Activity & Volume Spikes

**Anticipation and Hedging in the Market:** Trading patterns in Precigen’s stock over the last few weeks show heightened activity – consistent with investors jockeying ahead of the FDA decision. Some of these signals can hint at sentiment:

* **Volume and Price Action:** In late July and early August, PGEN stock experienced **surges in trading volume** alongside price gains. For instance, on one day the share price jumped to about **$1.78** (near a multi-year high) and trading volume exceeded **3 million shares**, vs. an average of \~1.96M . Over that week, the stock was up roughly 5–10%. This above-average volume suggests **accumulation by investors positioning for the FDA outcome** – essentially, increased demand for shares as traders speculate on approval. The stock’s 50-day and 200-day moving averages have been trending upward (currently around $1.57 and $1.55 respectively ), reflecting the strong rally in 2025 (year-to-date the stock is >50% higher ). Such momentum indicates that the market, in general, is leaning bullish on PRGN-2012’s prospects. The price hasn’t “sold off” or remained flat – it has strengthened as the decision nears, which is usually a sign that **investors expect good news** (or at least are not fearing bad news enough to exit positions).
* **Spike in Put Option Buying (Hedging):** At the same time, there has been a remarkable jump in options activity, specifically **put options** (which profit if the stock falls). In the last week of July, traders bought **5,477 put contracts** on PGEN in a single session – **a 284% increase** over the typical daily put volume . This *unusually large* put purchase did not coincide with a drop in the stock; in fact, as noted, the stock was rising. Such activity often points to **hedging by investors** who are long the stock and want protection, or speculative bets by others anticipating volatility. In context, it likely means that some fund or traders who are bullish overall still wanted **insurance against a negative FDA outcome** (e.g., a rejection or delay that would crash the stock). Buying puts is a way to guard against a potential *“worst-case scenario”* without selling the core position. It could also be outright bearish speculation, but given the stock rose on heavy volume, hedging by longs is a reasonable interpretation. This indicates a note of **caution** underlying the optimism – even bulls acknowledge there is never 100% certainty with the FDA. The presence of put hedging suggests that *while most signals are positive, the market is not completely discounting risk*. There’s awareness that if, for some reason, the FDA issues a Complete Response Letter (rejection), the downside could be severe, so prudent investors are preparing for both outcomes.
* **High Short Interest:** Another related signal is the persistently **high short interest** in PGEN shares. Currently, about **19–20% of the float is sold short** , which equals \~28 million shares shorted . That is a sizeable short position. Interestingly, short interest has not drastically decreased going into the FDA decision (often shorts would cover if they feared an approval rally). This could mean a couple of things: some short-sellers might be betting that **if approval happens, the stock is already priced for it or the company might face challenges (like commercialization or needing more cash)**, thus limiting upside. Alternatively, some shorts might believe the FDA could surprise with a negative decision (perhaps they are skeptical of the single-trial data or have concerns about manufacturing that the bulls ignore). It’s also possible that a portion of the short interest is **hedging by convertible note holders or arbitrage strategies**, not pure bearish bets. Regardless, the relatively large short position implies there is a **contingent of investors taking a contrarian view** or hedging heavily. From a sentiment perspective, this is a **mixed signal**: it injects some doubt into an otherwise optimistic picture. On the flip side, such high short interest sets the stage for a *short squeeze* – if PRGN-2012 gets approved and the stock jumps, shorts may rush to cover, potentially amplifying gains. In other words, the shorts represent pent-up pessimism that could quickly unwind on good news, which bullish investors actually view as a positive catalyst.
* **Overall Market Behavior:** The combination of rising share price, strong volume, and increased options hedging paints a picture of a market that is **gearing up for a pivotal event**. The net bias appears positive (price and volume action), but with a protective overlay (puts and shorts) acknowledging binary risk. It’s common before big FDA decisions to see this kind of dual behavior: speculators and investors buying shares for the upside, while more cautious players ensure they’re covered against downside. Importantly, no mass sell-off or exit is evident – which we *would* likely see if there were whispers of trouble. In fact, the stock’s resilience suggests **no leakage of bad news**; if anything, the steady climb could hint that many expect a favorable outcome.

# Summary & Sentiment Outlook

In the weeks leading up to the August 27 PDUFA decision, **the balance of signals tilts toward an FDA approval for PRGN-2012**. Both formal and informal indicators convey a generally *bullish* sentiment: Wall Street analysts have raised targets and uniformly expect success , significant shareholders (from biotech hedge funds to Precigen’s own insiders) have been **buying or holding**, not selling , and the company and FDA’s actions (priority review, no AdCom, aligned trial endpoints) all point to a smooth review process . On investor forums, optimism runs high – even to speculative extremes – reflecting a view that PRGN-2012 could be a **transformative therapy** for a rare disease and a big win for the company. At the same time, the presence of hedging and short interest shows a thread of **caution**: some stakeholders are managing risk, aware that nothing is guaranteed until the FDA’s decision is final. This prudent caution does not so much indicate a belief that approval is unlikely, but rather acknowledgment of the stakes.

Crucially, we have not seen any negative development (such as FDA extending the review, safety alarms, or insider dumping of shares) in the recent period – **no “smoke” that would hint at fire**. The informal clues – like trading patterns and message board chatter – align with the formal narrative that **Precigen is on track**. If PRGN-2012 gets approved, Precigen stands to have the first-ever therapy for RRP, and the market’s positioning suggests many are betting on that outcome. Conversely, a surprise rejection would catch a portion of the market off guard (as evidenced by how much upside analysts and investors have priced in), though the hedges in place would soften the blow for some.

Overall, the **informal sentiment is optimistic**: the weight of recent signals – analyst commentary, investor positioning, and lack of red flags – leans toward an expectation that the FDA will **approve PRGN-2012**. The subtle cues from the FDA’s handling of the review further bolster this outlook. In summary, while one should always be prepared for surprises in biotech, the current tea leaves suggest that Precigen’s PRGN-2012 has a strong chance of earning the FDA’s nod, with the market **quietly upbeat** (if cautiously so) about that prospect. All eyes will be on late August for confirmation of these signals.
I’m also long on PGEN for pretty much the reasons outlined above with the added bit that FDA approval validates their adenoviral delivery platform.  Most delivery uses adeno-associated viruses (AAV) which have some pretty severe limitations but they use adenovirus.  Their adenovirus is derived from gorillas which sounds weird, but it actually means that unlike with AAV, the vast majority of humans don’t have antibodies against this virus so can be treated with it.  It also enables repeat treatment, which often isn’t possible with AAV.

I think this gives them massive upside beyond the immediate gain should they get FDA approval.  Drug/gene/cell delivery is a huge field and this could have a really big impact. Huh, dug in a little and this does look interesting. It hasn’t run up yet, either, unlike much of what’s posted here. I assume there will be a ton of volatility leading up to the FDA decision so it will probably be up and down from here in hard-to-predict ways, but presumably it’d get a nice boost at approval. Seems like this might be one to DCA in then set stop loss in the days leading up to 8/27 And.... Trading halted Yeah I’ve been doing exactly this.  There was an uptake in short interest about a week ago that dropped it to 1.5ish and I bought then.  Next dip I’ll do the same, all just noise before the FDA approval Yap yap yap. 🤖 I'm holding it until monday's announcement by the company, decide after that. i suspect exit around 5-6. If there is any indication of acquisition, i'll hold longer. let me know if you learn something. Earnings next week and today is going down.. probably will go down even more after earnings and that might be a good time to buy it. WHY IS IT SINKING AFTER APPROVAL yes it has...any clue when trading might resume? What’s your price target if approved? It’s looking interesting to me and i might buy after earnings tomorrow",1,0.53,28,0,vikznl,pennystocks,['GME'],hello gentlemen women take pgen edit hope made good money yes chatgpt 72k shares signals

1mky5q8,2025-08-08,"Eco Wave Power ($WAVE) Installs Core Energy Conversion Unit at Port of Los Angeles
Eco Wave Power (NASDAQ: WAVE) just put in its Energy Conversion Unit at the Port of Los Angeles which is a big step toward testing its first ever US wave energy pilot...Btw maybe not a pennystock per-se but their market cap is super small so id say it fits in here

The ECU is the heart of their onshore system. It turns the up and down motion of waves into clean electricity and it does it without drilling into the seabed or building anything heavy in the water. With this now in place the project moves from building to getting ready for operation. They are finishing the hydraulic and electrical connections now and plan to show it all off on September 9

Main project highlights:  
\- First US pilot for Eco Wave Power hosted by AltaSea at the Port of Los Angeles  
\- nuilt to help with environmental checks and make it easier to work with regulators and to show off the tech to officials industry people and potential partners  
\- Local companies involved  
\- All-Ways Metal a woman-owned california shop made the floaters which went in at the end of July 2025  
\- Backed by Shells Marine Renewable Program which adds extra industry credibility

Watch for:  
September 9th 2025 when they officially open the project with US and California officials clean energy leaders and media from around the world. It is set to be a big showcase of what onshore wave energy can do and why WAVE is seen as a pioneer in this space
Been watching this for awhile. It’ll go places Israeli companies = Chinese companies, Therefore NEVER buy them if you don't want to lose your money!

1mk50f0,2025-08-07,"Gold Resource Corp (GORO) Will be a $30 stock again. Currently trading at .50cents
In 2011 during the last bull run in Gold & Silver it was over $30 and now it's at .50 cents. Same company but better positioned.

Extremely Undervalued Stock with Significant Upside Potential

* Current Price vs. Analyst Targets: GORO is trading at approximately $0.51 per share, with a 52-week range of $0.12 to $0.82. Analysts, including H.C. Wainwright, have set a 12-month price target of $1.25 to $1.50, suggesting an upside potential of 101% to 194%. This indicates the stock may be significantly undervalued based on its operational and growth prospects.
* Market Opportunity: Gold and silver prices have been bolstered by geopolitical uncertainties and inflation concerns, positioning GORO to benefit as a producer of these safe-haven assets. With a market cap of around $69.74 million, GORO is a small-cap stock with room for growth as investor interest in precious metals rises.

Strong Operational Foundation

* Core Assets: GORO operates the Don David Gold Mine (DDGM) in Oaxaca, Mexico, producing gold, silver, copper, lead, and zinc. The discovery of the Three Sisters vein system at DDGM has led to an 800% increase in mineral reserves (526,152 tonnes), showcasing significant resource expansion and operational potential.
* Strategic Financing: GORO recently secured a $6.3 million debt facility to develop the Three Sisters vein system with minimal shareholder dilution. This prudent financial strategy supports growth while preserving equity value.
* Exploration Potential: The company’s Back Forty project in Michigan, covering 1,304 hectares, adds diversification with potential for high-return, low-capital-expenditure projects. This dual-asset strategy mitigates risk and enhances long-term growth prospects.

Positive Technical and Market Signals

* Short-Term Trends: GORO is in a strong rising trend in the short term, with analysts forecasting a 23.07% price increase over the next three months, supported by a 90% probability of holding between $0.463 and $0.81. Technical indicators, such as a buy signal from the 3-month Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), suggest positive momentum.
* Analyst Sentiment: The consensus rating is Moderate Buy, with one analyst issuing a Strong Buy rating and no sell ratings, reflecting confidence in GORO’s outlook.

Positioned for Macro Trends

* Safe-Haven Demand: Geopolitical risks and inflationary pressures are driving demand for gold and silver, which GORO produces. Posts on X highlight bullish sentiment toward precious metals, with some investors noting gold’s role as a hedge against economic uncertainty.
* Low Beta: With a beta of 0.83, GORO exhibits lower volatility than the broader market, making it an attractive option for risk-averse investors seeking exposure to precious metals
Commenting to come back later when smarter people than me leave some comments Not smarter but GORO is a cool ticker. Mortal Kombat 1, Goro was cool af back when.  Did some quick DD:

This company has been in the red for a bit and has almost no cash. They're borderline illiquid. They own gold mines but their current extraction costs exceed the price of gold itself per ounce.

Their leadership appears to be banking on some inflow of capital to upgrade their equipment/process to lower their mining cost (ideally well below the current price of gold).

If they can manage to pull that off, obviously gold is always a valuable asset, and I believe gold isn't even close to it's maximum value yet. The world's confidence in the dollar is eroding, recession is looming, and people need a thing they can trade that they feel they can trust in these circumstances.

That said... invest with caution. This one is probably 10/90 boom to bust. They're bordering on capitulation, but they have some path to glory if gold price keeps surging and they can make the necessary investments to get their production costs in check. I'll bite. Mining companies are like biopharma companies. They are virtually worthless until they strike it rich, either with FDA approval or a proven mine. Right now, this company has a history of good mines, but nothing going forward that is solid. It is all potential, hence the decrease in price. It would be like if a pharma company sold their patents to fund a new product, but that product has only just now entered FDA review. Rarely do those companies come out of FDA review/trials with success the first time, and often taking multiple trials. The same applies here. There is the possibility of success with these newer mines, but nothing is certain. It is a ton of risk, like quite high, but on the chance they make it, it will have an equally high reward. Mining companies seem like moneyholes to me Sir, this company couldn’t even turn a profit after gold went through the roof…

You should go all in. 

/s In case you thought this was financial advice. Im going to be honest dude

If youre going to invest in the mining sector do it in rare earth related ones like UAMY and NB

Look at the massive push the federal government is doing for rare earth production and mining and how many grants companies like this are getting

During the entire trump administration THIS is the mining sector to invest in - not random gold mining companies that are full of risk. Sold yesterday at 10 percent loss Gold price last two years: nearly doubles.

GORO price last two years: cut in half.

1mk25c2,2025-08-07,"$CAN – Canaan might be quietly setting up for a turnaround + Q2 Earnings August 14th 🚀
What is Canaan?

Basically, Canaan is a company headquartered in Singapore, primarily focused on designing and producing high-performance ASIC hardware for bitcoin mining. 

They have also expanded into self-mining operations, and as of mid-2025, it controls over 6.5 EH/s in global hashrate and holds more than 1,480 BTC. The company is actively expanding in North America, while continuing its mining and infrastructure in Asia 🚀


Price: ~$0.66

June BTC production: 88 BTC

BTC holdings: 1,484 BTC – a company record

Hashrate: 6.57 EH/s globally, with a ~1 EH/s North America expansion ongoing

Company buybacks active, showing management believes shares are undervalued

They stopped with their AI Chips business to focus entirely on mining and profitability

And one thing to keep in mine, there were big insider purchases in June:

CEO Nangeng Zhang and CFO James Jin Cheng purchased a combined 817,268 shares

Avg. price: ~$0.76/share → over $620,000 invested out of pocket

5 reasons of why it's worth taking a look 🧐

1. Insiders are buying


2. Production is growing


3. Company holds BTC as a reserve asset, which could appreciate significantly


4. Actively buying back shares, which reduces dilution and suggests undervaluation


5. Focusing purely on mining and efficiency, shutting down less profitable segments of their business 

6. Today (08/07) they anounced the date of Q2 results:

Canaan Inc. Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call

""The Company's management team will hold a conference call at 8:00 A.M. on August 14, 2025, U.S. Eastern Time (8:00 P.M. on the same day, Singapore Time) to discuss the financial results. Details for the conference call are as follows:

Price targets from analysts:

Average: $2.60 (+300% upside) 🐂

High: $5 (+600% upside) 🚀

1mk0ke5,2025-08-07,"PSTV Shareholders Approve Key Changes In Today's Shareholders Meeting. Get Ready for What’s Next!

Hello again everyone, you had to assume I was going to be giving a fresh update and some DD after the shareholders meeting this morning.. so let's get to it and clear the air real quick...

PSTV just voted YES to a 1 for 25 reverse split. ( thin, NON Panic ratio).. and some people might see that and immediately think it’s bad. But this is not one of those panic moves you see from dying companies. This is a thin, controlled split that sets the stage for what’s coming next.

This is not some sketchy 1 for 100 desperation move. A 1:25 split is one of the cleaner ratios you’ll see. No red flags here!!!  This isn’t about trying to stay alive  this is about tightening up before what is going to be a massive run.

This move isn’t random.. they planned this.  they’re tightening the float because catalysts are lined up. Here’s the proof:

1. FDA Greenlighted Their New Brain Cancer Treatment!!
The FDA just cleared REYOBIQ for pediatric brain tumors. That’s not speculation... that’s OFFICIAL!! They’re entering clinical trials on a market with no other good options.


2. They Just Secured $1.6M in Non-Dilutive Funding
That came straight from CPRIT (Cancer Prevention & Research Institute of Texas). It’s free money, not another dilution trap.


3. CNSide Platform Is Already Rolling Out Commercially
This isn’t a “future maybe” pipeline. they’ve already started deploying CNSide now in Texas to detect cancer through spinal fluid. That’s real-world utility, not a PowerPoint pitch.


4. Conference Presentation Coming Aug 14–16
They’ll be presenting live at the SNO/ASCO CNS Metastases Conference. one of the biggest in their field... has sent other companies in the same field FLYING. . Expect attention.



So yeah, if you’re holding..don’t flinch... AND DONT DUMP .. This split is just a clean up job to get the house in order before they step up onto a bigger stage. The fundamentals haven’t changed. NOTHING HAS CHANGED.. that's why we got the THINNIST RATIO for the R/S!!! In fact, they’re only getting stronger!!! 

If you believed in PSTV last week, there’s even more reason to believe now. DO NOT PANIC SELL.

We’re holding through this. Let the dust settle and watch what happens next. EVERYTHING IS OKAY



Edit: Ratio was changed to 1:25

1mjfa22,2025-08-06,"XRTAF is Growing Too Fast (DD)
Tl;dr:

* Xtract One ($xtraf) has been growing at 100%+ for 4 years
* Has order backlog to continue growing at 100%
* Cash flow problem from growing too fast + temporary tariff setback
* Growth stock is temporarily cheap

Here are the charts for two competing companies. They are both making AI systems to replace metal detectors in stadiums, schools and hospitals. 

The older incumbent:

https://preview.redd.it/z4tikk5ugghf1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1a78c2452d9511a5ae1fcf04e4a48e6e0a878cd

And the newer competitor:

https://preview.redd.it/7nqyoosvgghf1.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb450d826b7f83088d39febf8afe9f2dcc282b03

Xtract One has been growing faster than Evolv and recently came out with a better product, but they’re down 53% on the year while Evolv is up 126%. Hence this DD. 

**Evolv (the bigger incumbent)**

Two machine setup, one machine for people and one for bags.

https://preview.redd.it/tyob5onzgghf1.png?width=360&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d658989214321dd2ecc743bfd686abdf8ad5c45

This takes more space and is slower to process. Their setup requires 300 lb of machinery to process 1900 people per hour (source: [DHS Sept 2024 SAVER report](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-09/24_0924_st_weaponsscreeningmsr_1.pdf)):

Accuracy isn’t perfect. Evolv was sued by the FTC in the last twelve months for failing to detect weapons while incorrectly flagging items like water bottles, three ring binders and laptops.

Financially, Evolv is losing money but is growing at a 57% rate with a 58% margin. Market Cap/Sales is an expensive 10.0.

**Xtract One**

Lesser known company but seems to have the better product. Only requires one machine:

https://preview.redd.it/6vkeryg8hghf1.png?width=956&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ea999145b755aa9a071566a139a509c5a391eff

Customers don’t have to take off their bags, they can just walk through. This is convenient, and also lets people flow through 25% faster:

https://preview.redd.it/ykdh953ahghf1.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=fafff04e29e06e605455c503e3e13dfa37b4b794

It’s also only 40 lb compared to Evolv’s 300 lb double machine set up, so it’s portable and easy to set up between events. [Pricing is about 40% lower](https://stadiumtechreport.com/feature/security-scanners-market-report-who-are-the-providers-in-the-stadium-security-scanner-marketplace) than Evolv. 

Financially, they’re smaller but growing faster, at a 105% annualized growth rate:

https://preview.redd.it/gh5tlzkbhghf1.png?width=1888&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c84c450c9d51d499fd2d8dbfed1108a3f02aebc

Margins are 57% and expected to grow higher. 

**Xtract One Gateway**

They came out with a new product in July:

https://preview.redd.it/arjoj0zehghf1.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&s=4373de3c06ba709e5bff112c9e796c78170c1681

This has better accuracy and can identify the bottles, laptops and other metal items that the FTC sued Evolv for not detecting. 

Most importantly, this new product is getting them deals from Fortune 100 companies. 

**Revenue to multiply, again?**

I’m convinced they’re crushing it:

“our business model has shifted quite significantly from smaller companies and deals to much larger organizations, particularly Fortune 100-type organizations…**average deal size is growing significantly, almost threefold**.”

Revenue could multiply if they can ship fast enough: they did $16M revenue in the last twelve months. Order backlog is $36.5M. $100M of qualified sales pipeline, of which $40M is at late stages.

Margins are high (57%) and expected to grow next year. Unit costs are going down as production scales up.

They’re doing security at Madison Square Garden and the Las Vegas Sphere and are starting to land more blue chip names. 

Disney deal coming? “a global customer, a large global media and entertainment organization… potential for expansion over time across the brand's portfolio of hundreds of entertainment venues, retail stores and production facilities worldwide…feedback from the customer who had tested other solutions has been outstanding.”

Cirque Du Soleil? “\[Xtract One\] was chosen by a leading, global performing arts company, known for permanent and touring live entertainment”

A deal was announced this quarter with an MLB team, the Colorado Rockies.

“for every customer announcement we make there's obviously many, many more dozens that have not been made publicly”, since their customers “do not announce security technologies”.

**Why is the stock down?**

Cash Flow! This is a tale as old as time. Rapidly growing company runs into a cash flow problem as soon as it starts working with Fortune 100 companies. They have to pay upfront to develop and manufacture their new expensive product.

Ouch:

https://preview.redd.it/sgdwa7vlhghf1.png?width=1374&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d701bc94fb48eb6c62443339aaedd9e948893c1

They’re used to working with small schools and hospitals which pay quickly. Fortune 100 companies have long sales cycles, and then you often get paid 90+ days after you finally deliver the product. Xtract One is new to working with large companies and got wrecked, they ran out of cash manufacturing their new product:

https://preview.redd.it/j73yn7bkhghf1.png?width=1418&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1384654ccf74a178472808a3c7fefb454e3ebf1

Notes from the quarterly transcript.

Fortune 100 deals are slow:

“First, the mix of our business and our business model has shifted quite significantly from smaller companies and deals to much larger organizations, particularly Fortune 100-type organizations. Accordingly, these larger organizations tend to invest a lot more time in the analysis, the budgeting, the security design, the con ops and the flow of their overall business mapping out that whole process and often request pilots that last from 30 to 90 days, where previously we might have seen pilots lasting for a day. In the short run, this has delayed bookings and pushes out revenues.”

Then they got hit by tariffs:

“there was a noticeable pause with some of our customers as they evaluate the impact of the business from the rapidly changing U.S. economic policies”

And their customers paused their sales cycle to reevaluate their new product:

“And lastly, we experienced some shifts from an interest in the SmartGateway to our new Xtract One gateway with some customers resetting their pilots”

And they switched from upfront sales to a subscription model, pushing revenue further back. 

**Cost of not managing Cash Flow**

Anyways, the story I’m hearing is this is a great company with a best in class product, that ran out of cash because it was growing too fast and then its customers paused deals due to tariffs. Good company that got caught off guard, and the cost was share dilution. They had to sell 18M shares at $0.39 CAD, raising $7M. They also had to throw in warrants to sell another 18M shares at an exercise price of $0.49.

Ouch. Embarrassing.

Anyways, um, they have plenty of cash now:

“We believe Q4 cash flow will be greatly improved. And in fact, we currently have more cash today than we did at quarter end. Accordingly, we feel comfortable in current cash levels to carry us through our next phase of growth.”

**Risks**

1. Cash flow. They just ran out of cash and had to dilute shares. I’m willing to forgive it because I think the cause is the business *is too good and is growing too fast*, but like ouch. They just raised $8.1M CAD so hopefully this isn’t a problem they run into again.
2. Competition. They seem to have the best product at the moment, but Evolv and other competitors are also iterating. At the moment though it seems the customer demand is plenty big for both of them.

**Why I’m buying**

It looks to me like Xtract One has a better product than the incumbent, Evolv, but it’s only priced at 1/20th the market cap. It’s priced at 3.7x sales, which is less than Evolv’s 10x. They’ve been growing at 100%+ for four years and their sales backlog points to hyper growth continuing.

Their big issue was growing too fast and running out of cash. Growing too fast is a problem I’m willing to forgive. Management says they’re comfortable with cash levels now, and while I’m not as confident as they are, I’m willing to take the risk. 

Also, the subscription model change and delays due to tariffs and switching to Fortune 100 companies is making their growth story look weaker than it is:

https://preview.redd.it/9jg49ec4ighf1.png?width=1710&format=png&auto=webp&s=46a7d7252cacb7af3362500761905e2f2236826c

Management is saying their growth is basically exploding still, and these numbers should show up in the back half of the year. Given this is a thinly traded OTC Canadian stock that nobody is talking about, I’m betting the market just isn’t giving them proper credit for their growth story yet, but they’ll figure it out in a quarter or two. 

Anyways, I’m in for $175k @ $0.25 USD

1mjbtg9,2025-08-06,"CPSH an undercover company executing while having a large pipeline.
# So what does CPSH do?

They are a metal matrix composite company or MMC for short. They supply base plates and housings to semiconductors. What does this actually mean? They basically provide housings for semiconductors to improve thermals. This is especially valuable in EVS, hybrid EVS and wind turbines. In October 2024 they secured a 13.3 million dollar contract for a 12 month span which means it should last through 2025.

They basically had a turnaround year where their financials have significantly improved. In their last two quarters they returned to profitability. Although the market has rewarded this improvement, I think there is significant upside to the company. For reference the company is profitable and generated 8 million in revenue this quarter. This was a company high and a 60% improvement from last year. There products are starting to really catch on, this is most likely due to tailwinds in industry with more uses for their ALSIC and Hermetic Packaging solutions. The CEO has also hinted that margins will increase and demand will be continuing through the year.

So what do we have?  
a company with 30 million revenue on the conservative side for this year and that's profitable and with a pipeline for the future. How many companies do you know that are US based, with 40 million market cap doing this? 

The company has a couple of moonshots. They have their MMC business which is there core business, and then they have the a bunch of SBIR contracts which hopefully turn into huge contracts. Their last huge contract was for their hybridTech armor for 28.7 million with the navy (this resulted in the stock hitting 25$ for a day). With the navy making their budget larger I have hopes that they will have another contract similar to the one they had before. Obviously this would lead to a huge run up.

https://preview.redd.it/5bex3711tfhf1.png?width=1621&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab3c3f05dfd457d0a046735aa722ae53cdba9e57

ALMAX is the most promising of the SBIR, they are the sole provider of this reinforced aluminum and just won a sbir contract with the army to improve amphibious vehicles and also had their first commercial order. This is really promising because its showing signs of another one of their products catching on.   
CPSH at this stage doesn't have much downside. Revenue is starting to stabilize and margins as well. Now is really just a waiting game for their 7 SBIR contracts to turn into something larger than what they are now. Even if only 1 of the SBIR contracts turn into larger ones the price should double.

Insider buying,   
there has been some insider buying so that's a good thing around 27k shares.

I have a position in this company and this is NFA

1mj5kwv,2025-08-06,"2025 Antimony Bull Market: Why Military Metals Corp ($MILIF | MILI.C) Is Front and Center
# 2025 Antimony Bull Market: Why Military Metals Corp ($MILIF | MILI.C) Is Front and Center

# Why Is Antimony Suddenly So Important?

Antimony is no longer a niche industrial commodity—it's now a linchpin in North America and Europe’s strategic materials push. Its role is essential in:

* **Ammunition and defense applications** (armor-piercing bullets, explosives, missile components)
* **Electronics and semiconductors** (flame retardants in circuit boards, batteries for grid-scale and military)
* **Energy storage and renewables** (antimony is key to next-generation batteries and energy storage systems)
* **Specialty alloys and catalysts**, vital for everything from advanced manufacturing to green transition tech

Over 70% of the world’s supply still comes from China, but 2024–2025 saw China severely restrict exports, pushing prices in Europe to highs last seen decades ago—over $59,000/tonne. Meanwhile, Western defense and tech suppliers are warning of “months, not years” before inventories run dry.

https://preview.redd.it/lgnve5htoehf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0472be72fb66a103b9ad35785cfb37c7a20c5ff

# Military Metals Corp ($MILIF | MILI.C): The Only Pure-Play Leveraged to Three Western Antimony Corridors

# Unique Global Footprint—No Other Junior Has It

**Military Metals Corp stands out for one simple reason:**  
It is **the only Western junior explorer and developer with large, advanced, and high-grade antimony assets in three of the world’s safest, most procurement-friendly jurisdictions**:

* **Europe (Slovakia/Trojárová)**
* **Canada (Nova Scotia/West Gore)**
* **United States (Nevada/Last Chance)**

**That means:** Whether U.S., Canadian, or EU buyers need antimony, $MILIF | MILI.C can meet their critical procurement needs—while also enjoying reduced geopolitical/political risk thanks to a diversified project pipeline.

# 1. Trojárová (Slovakia): Massive, Secure, Untapped Antimony Reserve

**Why it’s a Big Deal:**

* **Historic Estimate:** 2.46 million tonnes @ 2.47% Sb (\~61,000 tonnes contained antimony) plus gold byproduct credits.
* **Current Value:** Over $3 billion in-ground at spot prices.
* **Few equivalent Western assets:** Trojárová is among the largest undeveloped antimony deposits under NATO/EU control.
* **Technical Progress:** Underground LiDAR and modeling work ongoing, with major resource update pending (using SLR Consulting).
* **Strategic Leverage:** As the EU and NATO ramp up critical minerals procurement, this project could become a foundational supplier for Western defense and battery supply chains.

**What’s Next:**  
Watch for new resource models, advanced drill targeting, government engagement, and development study kick-offs. These are all potentially company-making events in a bull market.

# 2. West Gore (Nova Scotia): Near-Term Cash Flow From High-Grade Stockpiles

**Why it’s a Big Deal:**

* **Rare Near-Term Monetization:**
   * Historic stockpiles averaging nearly 18% Sb (up to 40%), with a gold kicker. Grades like these are almost unheard of today, especially in material that can be processed or sold rapidly.
   * Current estimates suggest over $30 million USD in antimony recoverable from stockpiles alone.
* **De-risked Entry:**
   * Stockpiles offer MILIF/MILI.C a way to start generating revenue long before new mines are built, rare for any junior explorer.
   * These can potentially be sent straight to North American refiners like UAMY, monetizing the resource immediately and building crucial relationships with domestic offtakers.
* **Exploration Upside:**
   * Magnetic drone surveys have outlined three new, promising high-priority targets in surrounding ground for future drilling—potentially growing the resource base even further.

**What’s Next:**  
Expect updates on processing, offtake deals, expanded drilling, and possibly even stockpile movement/early revenue—making cash generation and value crystallization real, not just theoretical.

# 3. Last Chance (Nevada): 100% U.S.-Controlled and Pentagon-Relevant

**Why it’s a Big Deal:**

* **Location is Everything:**
   * The U.S. Pentagon has declared antimony a “critical mineral.” U.S.-sourced, U.S.-controlled antimony is now a top defense priority.
   * Last Chance is 100%-owned by MILIF/MILI.C, sitting within a major U.S. mining jurisdiction.
* **High-Grade Potential:**
   * Surface rock-chip samples up to 11.6% Sb across a 1+ km trend.
   * Ongoing permitting for maiden drilling, with recent land expansion and aggressive targeting.
* **Strategic Upside:**
   * Could qualify for Pentagon strategic minerals support or direct procurement.
   * Fits perfectly into the narrative of “secure U.S. supply, for the U.S. military and industry.”

**What’s Next:**  
Keep an eye out for permits, drilling results, and potentially state/federal support for critical minerals development.

# Macro Catalysts for MILIF/MILI.C and Antimony

# 1. China’s Export Clampdown and Price Explosion

* Western buyers are increasingly locked out of Chinese supply. Prices have increased \~1,000% since 2020.
* European, US, and Canadian defense contractors have actively warned about imminent shortages.

# 2. NATO, EU, and Pentagon Are Aggressively Funding/Procuring Domestic/Allied Critical Minerals

* Massive new funding and procurement mandates across North America and Europe create huge tailwinds for credible Western antimony projects.
* MILIF/MILI.C’s footprint and asset stage uniquely qualify it for support and strategic relationships.

# 3. Western Stockpiles Are Critically Low—Immediate Demand Spike

* Key western buyers now have just “months, not years” of material left in inventory, putting a premium on near-term assets (like Canadian stockpiles) and credible new supply.

# The Investment Case: Why MILIF | MILI.C Is An Asymmetric Bull Market Play

* **Triple-jurisdiction, advanced-stage projects in ALL the right places**—literally the only Western junior to offer this level of Western procurement leverage.
* **Near-term revenue from Canadian stockpiles** (a huge edge as most juniors rely on years-long development).
* **Massive blue-sky upside** from Slovakia if unlocking a European-scale deposit during government procurement rush.
* **Real US-sourced antimony advances with Nevada progress**—vital as the Pentagon pulls domestic supply chains closer to home.
* **Multiple, near-term catalysts:** New resource estimates, permitted drilling, government grants/support, off-take deal announcements, and actual revenue from processing/stockpile movement.
* **Potential to partner, toll, or deliver feed to existing North American refiners like UAMY** while retaining project optionality.

# Why The Market Cares Now

The era of cheap, abundant antimony is over for the West. National security concerns, energy transition, and the digital economy are all converging to make antimony a high-profile, high-value, and politically protected mineral.

In this context, **Military Metals Corp ($MILIF | MILI.C) is the single most leveraged, catalyst-rich, and diversified Western play**.  
It’s not only a “story stock” for headlines but a near-term cash-flow generator and a scale-up pipeline for the world’s next big antimony supplier—precisely as policy, money, and investor attention flood into the sector.

[https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/china-western-defense-industry-critical-minerals-3971ec51](https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/china-western-defense-industry-critical-minerals-3971ec51)

**In summary:**  
If you are looking for a junior mining company that could anchor the Western antimony supply renaissance—delivering real assets, genuine jurisdictional diversity, immediate revenue, and maximum leverage to both price and policy—**$MILIF | MILI.C is it.**  
The next year will likely bring news-flow that could move MILIF from a niche explorer to a strategic cornerstone for Western defense, tech, and industry supply chains.
im a LT shareholder of MILI... once they get permitting for their 60k deposit in slovakia it is going to fly $3 billion in value just sitting there! UAMY is the play imho MILF YOLO Price prediction eoy? The slovakia asett is the biggest antimony deposit in Europe the equivalent of perpetua in the United States Slovakia is the biggest antimony deposit in Europe eq of Perpetua in United States All depending on Slovakian permit and the results of a drill program in west core. Also if they ship the Antimony stock pills sitting at WestCore to $UAMY The way the eu is ramping up military spending this could be huge. UAMY is producing. 

They are American,  too, which opens them up to funding and grants related to critical minerals.

According to this latest 10 Q MagnaChip has made the transition into power semiconductors. you can see that their only losses are from the display segment of their business.
As they stated in the previous quarters, they are now going to be a profitable company. Although the revenue is lower, their net profit is higher and in the green.

So what is going on that causes the dip to such a low price now? They lowered gross revenue estimates for remaining year is the thought. Because they are also claiming to be at least cash neutral - likely positive. So I am not sure why it took such a big hit. Possibly tariff scares but that makes no sense either because South Korea already made a deal with Trump admin.

1mizj4y,2025-08-06,"$NVNI Nuvini Group’s 6-K Shockwave: Dilution Drama Meets Sidoti Showdown
# Nuvini Group Issues 6-K Filing and Press Release

Today, Nuvini Group released a **6-K filing** and a press release covering two key announcements:

* Share dilution
* Participation in the Sidoti Microcap Conference

# 1. Dilution Issue

For penny stock investors, dilution is almost never tolerated, as it immediately leads to a decline in shareholder value and increased investor anxiety.  
At first glance, issuing 1.83 million shares in a company with 92.26 million outstanding shares may not seem significant, but dilution itself sends a **negative signal**.

In particular, the amount paid to existing investors through this issuance is only **$549,000**.

* Is it really worth accepting dilution for such a small amount?
* Given the timing, this appears closely related to SPAC-era investors.
* Issuing shares with a $2 par value at $0.30 could imply that even internal investors believe it will be difficult to return to $2 in the short term.

However, I do not see it that way. Unlike typical penny stocks, Nuvini has **growth momentum that is renewed monthly**, which can be highly valued as a driver of share price momentum.

I believe this issuance is more likely an **incentive for SPAC investors** rather than the result of a cash shortage.

* The company’s workforce is estimated at around 600–700 employees.
* Assuming an average monthly salary of $2,500, payroll alone would be $1.5–1.75 million per month.
* This makes the argument that the issuance was to secure $549,000 less convincing.

Ultimately, it is more likely the result of an **incentive agreement with investors who wished to receive shares**. Under SEC **Rule 144**, the shares are subject to a minimum six-month lock-up, providing a layer of shareholder protection.

# 2. Sidoti Microcap Conference

The Sidoti Conference is an event where microcap and small-cap companies participate to attract investors.  
Historically, Nuvini’s share price has not always risen after Sidoti events, but this time there is a possibility of a reversal.

# Key points from the May Sidoti presentation:

**Transition to execution stage**

* AI-driven operational efficiency improvements
* $127 million M&A pipeline
* Need to close the low valuation gap (P/E \~5x, P/S \~0.3x)

**Valuation gap closing strategy**

* Integration of Munddi (acquired in Q1 2025)
* Launch of Nuvini AI and increased operational transparency
* Margin expansion through AI adoption

At the time, management emphasized **profitability and growth in the Latin American SaaS market**, even directly stating that the stock was “undervalued.” Remarkably, the plans announced then have all been implemented.

# 3. Expectations for This Sidoti Event

This presentation is also expected to focus on **actual, executed results**:

* Verified 8% overhead cost reduction through Nuvini AI
* Nuvini AI Day results: 3 strategic products + 7 pipeline products with an average ROI of 500%
* Valuation recovery
* New acquisition plans
* Potential accounting and financial outlook

It remains uncertain whether earnings will be announced at Sidoti or through a separate earnings call.  
However, there is a possibility that high-growth earnings could be announced before or after the event, which could boost market expectations.

# Conclusion

While dilution is generally viewed negatively, in this case it appears to be an **incentive arrangement with a lock-up period**, making it less concerning.

The Sidoti Conference is expected to feature **execution-based results**, which could positively impact both short- and medium-term momentum.

Nuvini Group is not just another penny stock it is a SaaS company with **sustained growth catalysts and proven execution**.

1miuafj,2025-08-06,"Newron Pharmaceuticals Evenamide- The future Gold Standard in treatment-resistant schizophrenia
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-025-02188-y

Abstract
Schizophrenia is characterized by positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms. However, current D2-based antipsychotic drugs only address primarily positive symptoms. Limbic hippocampus hyperexcitability is a key pathological state of schizophrenia, representing an ideal therapeutic target. Evenamide is a selective voltage-gated sodium channel blocker that reduces neuronal hyperexcitability. We examined the effect of acute evenamide treatment on the hyperdopaminergic state, hippocampal hyperexcitability, social deficits, and recognition memory in the methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) neurodevelopmental model. Male and female Sprague-Dawley offspring from dams treated with saline or MAM on gestational day 17 were tested as adults (postnatal day >65). Electrophysiological recordings were made in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and ventral hippocampus (vHipp) and social approach and novel object recognition were tested. Evenamide (3 mg/kg i.p.) normalized the number of spontaneously active DA neurons in the VTA of female and male MAM rats and reduced pyramidal neuron hyperactivity in the vHipp. The hyperdopaminergic state in the VTA of female and male MAM rats was also rescued by local evenamide injection in the vHipp (1 µM). Systemic evenamide also reversed the recognition memory impairment of female and male MAM rats. For social deficits, only male MAM rats exhibit a reduced social sniffing time that was normalized by evenamide. These findings suggest that evenamide’s efficacy in downregulating the hyperdopaminergic state, social deficits, and recognition memory impairment may result from its ability to attenuate vHipp hyperexcitability. 

Therefore, evenamide could offer a novel therapeutic strategy that is capable of addressing positive, cognitive, and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.

1mig2rs,2025-08-05,"$CPSH: Why Isn't This Low-Float Microcap Moving? Stellar Financials, Big Contracts, and Huge Potential!
Fellow investors, I'm puzzled why $CPSH isn't seeing more volume or price action. This low-float microcap has no dilution, strong fundamentals, and massive growth potential. Here's the breakdown—tell me what I'm missing!

**Recent Financials (Q2 2025):**

* **Earnings:** $0.01 per share, a **114.29% improvement** from last year's $(0.07) loss.
* **Revenue:** $8.079M, up **60.62%** from $5.030M last year. One of their best quarters ever!

**Why CPSH Stands Out:**

1. **Major Tech Partnerships:** Long-term contracts with giants like $MSFT, $IBM, $HP, and $DELL.
2. **Aerospace & Defense Contracts:** Key deals with $LMT (Lockheed Martin), $RTX (Raytheon), and $CR (Crane). Their last big contract sent the stock to \~$30!
3. **Semiconductor Exposure:** Supplies Infineon, a top European semiconductor firm that powers $NVTS and $NVDA.
4. **Revolutionary Material:** Their composite matrix is a game-changer for tech, aerospace, defense, drones, ships, cars, solar/wind, and nuclear applications. Orders are rolling in, with growing interest.
5. **U.S. Navy Contracts:** Recently finalized a major deal with the Navy, their biggest customer. Another contract is expected soon, backed by newly funded naval budgets. Plus, SBRs with the DoD.
6. **Strong Ownership:** Heavy institutional backing from BlackRock, Vanguard, and others, plus recent insider buying signaling confidence.

**The Question:** With a tight float, no dilution, booming financials, and high-profile contracts, why isn’t CPSH spiking? Is it under the radar, or am I missing a red flag?
Looks good it's 8.02M Rev n debt cash =3.2M it's already trading at fair MC=42M X 5 Rev. It's a good entry point @ 1.80. I dont.see any obstacles after the Rev except forward guidance or any backlog? I personally love CPSH. Been holding for a while now. Thanks for the write up.

I came across this company recently, on news that they launched a new product: diagnostic on brain cancer:

1. CNSide : it runs a diagnostic on the patient to detect Brain cancer WITHOUT surgery, they have implemented it in Texas so far.

2. they have a drug (REYOBIQ) that targets incurable brain cancer
3. August 14-16 PSTV is going to present at the SNO/ASCO CNS Metastases Conference, where the whole world will see what they’re doing, how they are doing it and what they have achieved (this conference has sent similar bio stocks up).

Personally I’m holding a position in this stock. I also have BTAI (sold half when it doubled and leaving the rest for August 20th catalyst DYOR, trust me it’s worth some DD for an 85% chance FDA approval. This drug is used to treat agitation in dementia and bipolar affected people. Will present phase 3 trial results on the 20th this month.

I'm all in on PSTV! LETS GO!!! 🤑🎉🥂 For some reason its going down I know lots of people are concerned.... just sit back and relax. Everything is fine ...  and if you got in before the hype train..we are still in the green and having upward momentum. NOTHING HAS CHANGED.. the hype train started... and ended.. now there's a dip while it finds its footing again to it's true value .. there is no negative news.. the company didn't take a hit .. they are actually over 40 million in volume and in the green from their perspective. They are doing great still ...to us it looks like it started their run.. and got dumped or is crashing. But the trend line is normal. We aren't losing. Some portfolios are in the red on PSTV because most people bought in at like 80 cents give or take.. we just gotta let it find its footing until the 14th. We are OKAY.. everyone needs to RELAX.

And there is NOT a reverse split happening..The 7th is their annual shareholders meeting.. where there are PROPOSING several topics. Including reauthorizing an R/S. But there is not a vote happening on an R/S.. 

It's already being put in hospitals in Texas.. they are doing this silently ofc. Because they are dropping EVERYTHING at this conference... Their Earnings report is also on the 14th.. they are sharing their progress with the CNSide rollout, the success of CNSide platform.. and the success of their clinical trials for their drug REYOBIQ.. and remember.. any R/S is at their discretion.. so when and IF They vote on an R/S again.. they have 12 months to implement it after the vote. 


Everyone needs to take a breath.. and realize we are the ones who caused it to surge.. and now it's finding its footing after the hype train. We are still moving fine.. the company is doing great 👍🏼 Pstv entry price: 0.72 haven’t exited yet

1mia9xm,2025-08-05,"Antimony Making Headlines: Here Are My Top Antimony Stocks for 2025:
**$MILIF (Military Metals Corp): In-Depth Breakdown as 2025’s Top Antimony Play**

# Company Overview

Military Metals Corp (MILIF) is emerging as the standout junior mining company in the antimony sector, uniquely positioned with advanced assets in three key Western regions: Europe (Slovakia), Canada (Nova Scotia), and the United States (Nevada). Amid escalating geopolitical tensions and China’s chokehold on antimony exports, MILIF’s diversified footprint puts it squarely in the sights of Western governments and defense supply chains scrambling for secure, friendly antimony sources.

# Project-by-Project Detail

# 🇪🇺 Trojárová, Slovakia (Flagship Asset)

* Resource Size: Historical estimate of 2.46Mt grading 2.47% Sb (\~61,000 tonnes of antimony).
* In-Ground Value: Over $3B at current spot prices ($50,000–$59,800/t).
* Byproduct Credit: Also contains a gold byproduct of \~0.635g/t Au.
* Development Status: Underground LiDAR surveys underway, new resource model with SLR Consulting in progress.
* Strategic Relevance: One of the most significant undeveloped antimony resources in a NATO-aligned nation; critical for potential EU/US/NATO procurement.
* Future Milestones: Upcoming updated resource estimate, advanced drill targeting, and initiation of development studies.

# 🇨🇦 West Gore, Nova Scotia

* Stockpile Characteristics: Historic stockpiles sampled up to 40.6% Sb and 106.5g/t Au; assays average 17.9% Sb.
* Potential Value: Est. $30M worth of contained antimony accessible in legacy stockpiles alone.
* Exploration Status: Drone magnetic surveys have identified three new high-priority target zones for further drilling.
* Short-Term Monetization: Legacy stockpiles present unique near-term, low-barrier cash flow opportunity not often available to juniors.
* Future Milestones: Further stockpile processing, resource expansion through new zone drilling.

# 🇺🇸 Last Chance, Nevada

* Geology: Multiple showings over a 1km trend with surface samples up to 11.6% Sb.
* Ownership: 100% owned by MILIF, positioning it as a true U.S.-controlled critical mineral asset.
* Permitting & Development: Actively working on permits for maiden drill campaign.
* Strategic Upside: Solidifies MILIF’s eligibility as a U.S. domestic supply candidate—vital as the Pentagon prioritizes American antimony.

# Jurisdictional and Strategic Advantages

* Triple-Jurisdiction Model: MILIF is the only known junior with meaningful exposure in all three Western zones, offering significant flexibility as NATO, the EU, and the U.S. ramp up procurement from non-Chinese sources.
* De-Risking Through Diversity: Political, permitting, and off-take risks are diffused by the asset spread across stable, mining-friendly Western countries.
* First-Mover Advantage: As supply shock drives prices and Western strategic stockpiling, being first to develop in multiple safe jurisdictions compounds MILIF’s optionality and leverage.

# Current Catalysts and Macro Factors

* Development Catalysts:
   * Multiple resource/modeling milestones due.
   * New target discoveries at all projects.
   * Permitting advancement and possible near-term stockpile processing revenue.
* Antimony Market Tailwinds:
   * Prices hit $59,800/t+ in Europe after China’s export clampdown.
   * Western defense manufacturing now facing real supply shortages.
   * Active moves by Pentagon, NATO, and EU to fund friendly supply routes.
* Investor Asymmetric Opportunity:
   * Major upside from any of the “big three” assets achieving permitting, resource upgrades, or initial offtake agreements.
   * Early-stage status and microcap market valuation make MILIF the most leveraged to Western antimony reindustrialization.

# Investment Summary

$MILIF is uniquely positioned for potentially explosive upside because:

* It controls advanced, high-grade antimony projects in all three “priority procurement” Western regions.
* It offers near-term cash flow from Canadian stockpiles, massive resource leverage in Slovakia, and future development in the U.S.
* Its diversified portfolio, multiple paths to de-risking, and readiness for any geopolitical procurement wave set it apart during a global scramble for non-Chinese antimony supply.

If a Western antimony supply race truly accelerates in 2025, the scale, jurisdictional breadth, and upcoming project catalysts could make $MILIF the sector’s single most asymmetric play.

Best setup in the space, hands down. Real assets in NATO countries, near-term cash flow, and barely anyone's watching. CEO interview of Military Metals: [https://youtu.be/Wk2E7AZokK0?si=yZjizFKoAizzSTIw](https://youtu.be/Wk2E7AZokK0?si=yZjizFKoAizzSTIw) That Slovakia asset alone is wild Antimony is just heating up! Gonna be a fun rally All in on MILF r/criticalminingstocks

UAMY is the best Antimony play. They have proven mineral resources, they have the only 2 smelters in North America.  

They are shipping and processing antimony and have Department of Defense contracts. 1% the market cap of PPTA and 3/4 the Antimony 

60k tonnes vs. 80k tonnes; on the Slovakian asset alone! Its an explorer company, mines take 10-20 years to come online. usually a major will purchase something like this, then take into production once the assets have been proven to their liking.

1mi8wzn,2025-08-05,"$GAMB – Profitable, 85% locked float
Let me tell you about $GAMB – Gambling.com Group.

A profitable, cash-generating business expanding fast across the US and Europe.
Insiders own over 40%. Institutions own 45%+ (BlackRock, Vanguard, Susquehanna, Millennium, etc.).

That’s over 85% of the float locked up.
Only ~1.1M shares shorted, and daily volume is just 200k–400k.
It would take very little to trigger a sharp move.

Management said it loud and clear: they’re aiming for $100M EBITDA by 2026/2027.
Q1 2025 was already $41M revenue with strong recurring income and rising margins.
B2B segment (OddsJam + OpticOdds) is growing like crazy.

And yet… it’s stuck at $10. Why?

✅ Institutions aren’t selling
✅ Insiders aren’t selling
✅ Retail hasn’t noticed (yet)
✅ Accumulation is quiet and steady

Looks like someone is keeping this suppressed before the big move.
Q2 earnings drop August 14. If they crush it again, it could pop hard.

This is a low-float sleeper with real fundamentals.
Dirt-cheap valuation.
Zero hype. Zero meme. Real growth.
Once it breaks out, good luck catching it under $15.

DYOR but this one feels like a no-brainer.
Just needs attention. And a spark.
The float is tight. The fuse is lit. 🔥

Besides the fact that this post was terrible and written by ai (calls on nvdia & google) why has it fallen so much recently? As far as I can tell this website is just a domain squatter (more or less) with links to other gambling websites?  What else do they do?

^(if) ^(you) ^(have) ^(any) ^(questions) ^(or) ^(concerns.) There was no reason given for downside by the original poster. Bad sign GAMB Sentiment and Options Analysis

Stock Performance and Analyst Sentiment

GAMB’s stock has seen some pressure recently, down nearly 13% in the past month and over 28% year-to-date. However, it's still up 10% over the past year, rebounding from its 52-week low. Analyst sentiment is very positive: the current consensus is a Buy, with all recent analysts recommending buying and no hold or sell ratings. The average target price is $19.50, nearly double the current price, pointing to significant potential upside.

Recent News and Fundamental Drivers

Recent headlines highlight a mix of short-term struggles and long-term optimism. The stock dropped 16% in the last four weeks, but this may have pushed it into oversold territory, suggesting that selling pressure could be easing. Fundamentally, GAMB is seeing strong growth—subscription revenues jumped 400% in the past quarter, and management is considering share buybacks at these discounted levels, showing confidence in the business.

Options Flow Sentiment

Options flow for GAMB over the past three days (with a focus on significant trades over $25,000) shows no noteworthy activity. This lack of large options trades suggests that big players and institutions are largely on the sidelines in the options market right now. That could indicate a wait-and-see approach, with sentiment from options traders currently neutral due to limited volume and participation.

Summary

Equity sentiment: Bullish from analysts, neutral-to-cautiously optimistic from news and fundamentals.
Options sentiment: Currently neutral; no large, directional bets are evident in the recent flow.
Retail traders will want to watch for increased options activity as a sign of shifting sentiment, but fundamentals and analyst views remain strong for GAMB in the medium term. I bought a few shares. I’ll check it out a little more tonight My theory is the stupid 90% of losses only tax write off part of the big beautiful bill

However it has bipartisan support to overturned
Casino state reps putting pressure and many Republicans saying they had no idea they voted for it That’s the old misconception,  but it’s completely outdated.
Yes, it started as a pure SEO affiliate model, but that’s no longer the full picture.

They’ve built a full-stack performance marketing machine + now own premium assets like RotoWire, Casinos.com, OddsJam, and OpticOdds. They’re not just redirecting traffic, they create original betting tools, advanced odds comparison infrastructure, and subscription-based B2B products that sportsbooks pay for.

They’re moving from pure affiliate to data-driven monetization including high-margin recurring revenue. So no, it’s not just a ‘blog’ or domain squatter anymore.

1mhhnyw,2025-08-04,"Undervalued. Underrated. Unstoppable. PSTV Could 15x This Month! This Tiny Stock Just Changed Cancer Treatment Forever
Alright, here is ANOTHER DD for $PSTV, since we have seen AMAZING movement since last Wednesday. I spent a HUGE chunk of my morning getting all of this info and cleaned up the clutter so please listen up. And I hope you enjoy my DD!

 Every now and then, a tiny biotech stock sneaks under the radar before blowing the hell up. Think of it like getting in on a tech startup before they drop the app that changes the game. That’s where PSTV is sitting right now. And here’s the kicker...this one isn’t just hype. It’s already in motion!!!

The Setup:

PSTV is trading under at around .60 cents today. That’s penny stock territory. But they aren’t some BS shell company waiting on a miracle. PSTV is already making waves with a platform that could revolutionize how we treat brain cancer. We’re talking real-world use, not fantasy science.

The Catalyst That Changes Everything:
In LESS THAN 14 DAYS they are going commercial with CNSide, a first-of-its-kind liquid biopsy platform that detects brain tumors using spinal fluid.. no surgery required!!! Read that again.

Let that sink in. A non-invasive diagnostic method for brain cancer. That's never been done before. That alone puts them in a league of their own.

BUT WAIT, THERES MORE!

Within the same month, they’re presenting their clinical results for drug REYOBIQ!! a drug that targets and kills the two deadliest forms of brain cancer: glioblastoma and leptomeningeal metastases. They have had OVERWHELMING success according to sources. Also a world first!!

This Month is Critical And getting in ASAP is priority and Here's Why:

August 14-16: PSTV presents at the SNO/ASCO CNS Metastases Conference, where the world will get a look at what they’re doing. This conference has sent similar biotech stocks FLYING.

This is not a waiting game. The company is moving NOW. They’ve already received multiple designations from the FDA, including Orphan Drug and Fast Track. Including over 18 million dollars in government grants and the backing/support of world renown cancer institutes, colleges, doctors, and scientists.


Why This Could Make You Rich FAST?? 

Market cap is tiny: under $20M. One solid press release or clinical success, and this thing WILL explode.

They’re not diluting. and voting against reverse splits! They're focused. And they’ve got a legit science team backing everything up.

Price Target: Analysts and sentiment on social media are pointing toward $3–$4 in the short term, and $10+  long term! The highest bull price target is $32!!! Which honestly isn’t off the table as data and commercialization unfold.


If You Missed Out On:

NVAX before COVID

MRNA before it went viral

BNGO before genomics became hot


Then PSTV is your Second chance. 

I really hope my DD did some justice to PSTV. Where do y'all stand? Anyone else hopped on the train already? And if not.. what's stopping you? 

Edit: 🚨WE ARE IN OUR PRE-BREAKOUT DIP!🚨 This was expected, we rode the hype train for a day or 2 there so a dip was bound to happen on that alone. The data is still REAL and the Catalysts are still LIVE.. nothing has changed.. no negative news.. nothing. So buy more in this dip because  everything will be OKAY!  it's all still green hills I promise y'all. Just sit back and TRY to enjoy the ride. Have some faith and follow the Data. 
Bought 13k shares at 0.69. Going to sell at 4.20.

Lost 15k on ixhl last week but I've got a really good feeling on this one! I like the stock, am buying more, and see another few multiples in its future, but let's not run away with ourselves. Fundamentally, this is an effective niche diagnostic tool for a rare illness and a very effective drug for treating the same rare illness. Emphasis on *niche* (likely not insurer-friendly) and *rare* (small market cap). $3-4 is reasonable; $10-$32 is currently a pipe dream. You’re going to get rug pulled just like most of these ‘plays’ I'm sure you had a really good feeling on IXHL as well ... you’re either a bot, stupid or going to get wrecked/rug pulled or all 3. 

this post reads like a classic low‑float biotech hype post  all catalyst talk, no substance. PSTV is a microcap with no revenue, burning cash, and 100% dependent on early‑stage trial success. The “game‑changing” language and moon targets are exactly what you see in pump‑and‑dump setups. Conference presentations ≠ FDA approval, and retail hype won’t change the fact this thing can tank 50% overnight. Treat it like a lotto ticket if you must, but don’t mistake this for a fundamentally solid long‑term hold.

have fun I learned from IXHL to take profits and not be swayed by the dreams/pumping of social media...i should have taken profit at 1.50 instead of getting all starry eyed and indoctrinated with 'oh it'll hit $2/3/234478892409!!!11!' 

I'll probably hop on this for a little bit but actually set a 7% stop loss this time instead of extended bag holding. Expect a pop to $3-$4 by the end of the month. Probably by the 17th tbh. And highest price target I've seen so far is $32 but most of them sit in the $10-$15 range. We are up 20% today I think a rug pull is possible tbf. I have 10,000 shares and I’m in for $1, but we need to remember IXHL 3-4 is my price target for August 14-16.

1mhgiir,2025-08-04,"WSJ Article today and my Top Antimony Stocks for 2025: $MILIF and Key U.S. Peers
**Top Antimony Stocks for 2025: $MILIF and Key U.S. Peers**

**Why $MILIF (Military Metals Corp) Is the Standout Pick**

* **Unmatched Jurisdictional Reach:** Only junior with exposure in all three major Western regions—Europe (Slovakia), Canada (Nova Scotia), and the U.S. (Nevada)—positioning it as a unique potential supplier for Western defense and industry.
* **Large, High-Value Resource:** Trojárová project (Slovakia) boasts a historical 61,000t Sb resource—over $3B in current in-ground value at spot prices, with a gold byproduct as an added bonus.
* **Immediate Monetization Potential:** West Gore (Canada) stockpiles average 17.9% Sb, worth an estimated $30M, with some samples as high as 40.6% Sb and 106.5g/t Au—offering both scale and grade for near-term catalysts.
* **U.S. Supply Leverage:** Last Chance (Nevada) provides multiple antimony showings (up to 11.6% Sb) and is fully owned, making $MILIF a true domestic supply candidate.
* **Multiple Development Catalysts:** Ongoing resource modeling, geophysics, new target zones, and permitting activity across all three regions.
* **Macro Tailwinds:** China’s export restrictions have triggered a scramble in the West for secure antimony supply, pushing prices above $59,800/ton and spotlighting juniors with real assets.
* **Asymmetric Upside:** As an early-stage junior with major resource and near-term milestones, $MILIF offers high risk but also the most significant upside as the West re-industrializes antimony supply chains.

**Other Major Antimony Plays**

* **$XTPT (Xtra Energy Corp.)**
   * **U.S.-focused, Nevada-based explorer** with over 22 surface stockpiles averaging 12.8% Sb (up to 33%), early monetization opportunities, and an active drill program underway.
   * Expanded land holdings in strategic U.S. antimony belts (Nevada and Washington).
   * Multiple near-term catalysts: phase 1 drilling, stockpile sales, land expansion, and strong Pentagon alignment as the U.S. seeks domestic sources.
* **$UAMY (United States Antimony Corp)**
   * **U.S.-based producer and refiner** with established infrastructure—providing reliable North American supply.
   * Lower risk profile and slower growth, but steady performance as demand for domestically refined antimony rises.
   * Much of the supply “premium” may already be priced in by recent share activity, so upside is likely more modest.
* **$PPTA (Perpetua Resources)**
   * **Pre-production mega-deposit (Stibnite, Idaho) with Department of Defense backing.**
   * One of the largest U.S. antimony reserves, but still in pre-production—requiring significant capital and time.
   * Strategic long-term holding for those who want exposure to secure, large-scale U.S. reserves, but near-term upside is limited.

In this landscape, for me **$MILIF** earns the top spot for its unique global portfolio, multi-stage catalysts, and the ability to address Western strategic supply vulnerabilities. **$XTPT** is a pure U.S. explorer with active drilling and near-term stockpile monetization potential. **$UAMY** offers lower risk as a current U.S. producer, and **$PPTA** is a long-haul play tied to the largest U.S. deposit with government backing—but with a slower route to material returns.

1mh8feb,2025-08-04,"Spectral AI ($MDAI): 95.3% accurate gov-backed AI, FDA submission confirmed, earnings imminent, still under $2.50. This is what asymmetric setups look like before they break out.
Spectral AI ($MDAI) is, quite literally, what institutions wait for and what retail always sees first. A government-funded AI device with breakthrough-level clinical accuracy. A non-invasive wound diagnostics platform proven in trials, preparing for commercial deployment, and now officially submitted to the FDA. Yet still trading at a market cap of just \~$54 million. No analyst coverage. No real volume. And now, with Q2 earnings less than two weeks away, the setup is cleaner than ever.

The core product, DeepView®, is an AI imaging system that identifies the depth of surgical burns with 95.3% accuracy, confirmed in a multicenter trial completed in May–June 2025. For comparison: trained surgeons average 40.8%. DeepView also improved detection of non-healing wounds from 61% to 89%, all without ever touching the patient. This isn’t theory. It’s clinically proven. And the U.S. Department of Defense has already awarded Spectral a contract to support its integration in battlefield and trauma care settings. That matters. Real funding. Real interest. Real-world stakes.

Spectral has received over $130 million in non-dilutive government support, holds FDA Breakthrough Device Designation, and filed its De Novo submission on June 30th, 2025. That submission marks the shift from speculation to execution. From “potential” to “pipeline.” And it opens the door to institutional screens, analyst models, and serious capital.

What makes this even more extraordinary is that Spectral AI currently has no direct competitors. There is no other company with a fully developed, FDA-submitted, AI-driven solution for non-invasive wound diagnostics. If approved, Spectral will hold a first-mover monopoly in a $14.6 billion global wound care market. That’s not narrative - that’s math. A single-player advantage in a multi-billion dollar market is almost unheard of at this valuation level. And the market still hasn’t noticed. 

The timing couldn’t be better. Q2 earnings drop on August 12th after market close. Last quarter, Spectral posted its first profitable result, beating expectations with $6.7 million in revenue and $2.9 million in net income. If this quarter confirms that trajectory, the narrative shifts fast. Profitability plus FDA momentum is the one-two punch most small-cap medtech investors dream of - and it’s happening now, in real time, at sub-$60M valuation. 

Most sub-$3 stocks are early, unproven, and unfunded. Spectral is none of those things. It’s past the preclinical stage. Past the funding gap. Past the technology risk. The product works. The trials are done. The government is involved. And the FDA review has officially begun. But the price still reflects a company that hasn’t even started.

With 40 million fully diluted shares, a $1 billion valuation would put the stock at $25. That’s not a stretch. That’s a rational estimate based on FDA approval and modest commercial adoption. If DeepView becomes standard-of-care in trauma, burns, or diabetic ulcers - even in a fraction of the market it addresses - the upside becomes hard to model. That’s what a monopoly in a $14.6B space looks like before the market wakes up.

And here’s what most people are missing. MDAI shareholders are expected to receive shares in SMIP, Spectral’s IP-focused spin-off, which is preparing for a separate Nasdaq IPO later this quarter. SMIP holds and manages the underlying patents behind DeepView, and high-profile investors , including Donald Trump Jr. ,  already have a stake. It’s rare to see a microcap medtech company deliver this kind of optionality on top of real clinical traction. Yet here we are.

**Bottom line: Spectral AI is far past the point where the market should still be ignoring it. FDA submission is in. Contracts are active. Clinical data is in the books. Earnings are imminent. And the spin-off is coming. But because there’s no coverage, and no hype, it’s still flying under every radar that matters. That won’t last.**
OP: how about posting stuff like that during lows (april - mai 2025). I'm not interested in getting into this at the top without any margin of safety 😂 Could chat GPT write up. But here's what ChatGPT says.

The screenshots you’ve shared paint a very bullish picture of Spectral AI ($MDAI) — but the tone and structure read more like a promotional pitch than an objective analysis, so I’d be careful before making decisions. Here’s my breakdown:

The Bullish Case (as presented)

Technology & Accuracy

DeepView® AI imaging claims 95.3% accuracy in identifying surgical burn depth, significantly higher than trained surgeons.

Non-invasive, no patient contact, proven in multicenter trials.

Already used in military/trauma contexts with U.S. DoD interest.

Government & FDA Position

Over $130M in non-dilutive government funding.

Holds FDA Breakthrough Device Designation and has filed a De Novo submission (June 30, 2025).

Contract with the U.S. Department of Defense for battlefield/trauma integration.

Financial & Market Potential

Q2 earnings due August 12th (less than two weeks away).

Last quarter was their first profitable quarter ($6.7M revenue / $2.9M net).

Market cap only ~$54–60M with claims of a $14.6B total addressable market.

No current direct competitors.

Extra Catalyst

Possible spin-off (SMIP) with separate Nasdaq IPO. Shareholders may receive spin-off shares.

The author frames this as a ""first-mover monopoly"" situation.

The Risks & Red Flags

Source & Tone

This post is clearly written to hype. The language is promotional (“this won’t last,” “monopoly,” “door to serious capital”). That’s typical of penny stock forums and can be a sign of someone talking their own book.

No mention of risks like FDA delays, competition, or cash burn rates.

Regulatory Uncertainty

FDA submission ≠ approval. The process can take months or even years. A delay or rejection could tank the stock.

Commercialization Risk

Even with great trial results, adoption in healthcare is slow. Hospitals, burn centers, and military procurement have long sales cycles.

Market size estimates ($14.6B) may be overly optimistic — not every wound care setting will adopt immediately.

Microcap Volatility

~$54M market cap means extreme price swings on relatively small volume.

If insiders, institutions, or hype traders dump shares, price could collapse quickly.

Spin-off Hype

Spin-offs can be good, but they can also be overhyped to boost the parent company’s stock short term.

Little detail is given about SMIP’s actual revenue, market readiness, or financials.

Balanced View

Potential Upside: If the FDA approves DeepView and adoption happens even modestly, the stock could move sharply higher from current levels.

Real Risks: Approval isn’t guaranteed, commercialization will take time, and hype-driven buying could reverse violently.

Investment Type: This is a speculative microcap biotech/medtech play — not a safe, steady investment. You’d only allocate money you’re willing to lose entirely.

If you want, I can dig up current analyst sentiment, institutional ownership, and recent SEC filings for $MDAI so you’ll have a more grounded, less Reddit-hyped picture before deciding.

Do you want me to do that next? Here is what I think

* Their debt is about 70% of their Total Cash
* Analysts' average is \~ $5 (that's currently a 2.1x bagger)
* Insider purchases are strong (14k shares purchased to 0 sold)
* [Their TAM is $2-$3B (burns niche)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1mh8feb/comment/n6ufhlb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), which is still very attractive since they don't seem to have competitors in their niche

\- They've just sent their device to the FDA, a possible approval will only work as a **catalyst between 12/2025 to Q1 2026**.

I would have probably scooped a few shares for shits and giggles when they PPS was around $1.20. We are currently at $2.36, which is [historically almost higher than it has ever been](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MDAI/) (if you don't count two pump spikes).

The PPS needs to come down in order for me to increase Margin of Safety. Check this out , there's a total of 8 videos , Answers everything from Finances, to FDA Approval , Army handheld device , etc . from A-Z 

[interview with Spectral AI's Chairman of the Board, Dr. J. Michael DiMaio](https://youtu.be/cGktsfcfYSM)

[MDAI : Finances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6RdtHfjs98&t=94s)

[Spectral AI's DeepView FDA Submission Process](https://youtu.be/25nbD9FZIjs)

And from what I understand MDAI shareholders will get free shares of the new IPO SMIP (Spectral IP) of which Trump Jr. is on the board. For better or worse lol , you be the judge Entering now might be a bit scary, I've been buying shares over past 6 months. I'm pretty confident that they will get approval without problems but it can take anywhere from few months to couple years. I work in a regulatory/quality team for a medical device supplier in Europe and I'm not that sure about the FDA timelines.

  
But ye I at least recommend adding this to your watchlist I also wondered, this is what the almighty GPT says:

# 🧠 1. TAM – Total Addressable Market

**Global wound care market**:

* Estimated at **$23B+** in 2024 and projected to grow to **$30B+** by 2030.
* Covers all types: **burns, diabetic foot ulcers (DFU), pressure ulcers, surgical wounds**, etc.
* Of that, **AI-based wound assessment and imaging** is a **fast-growing subsegment**.



📌 **TAM for Spectral AI**:  
👉 **$2B–3B** (focused on **AI-driven diagnostics** for burns and DFUs globally)

# 🎯 2. SAM – Serviceable Available Market

This narrows down to:

* **Burn and DFU diagnostics**, not wound dressings or general wound care.
* Markets with clinical infrastructure or funding (e.g., U.S., Europe, military/defense).

Spectral AI’s own investor materials indicate a **$1.7B SAM** opportunity:

* \~$600M in burn triage (civilian + military)
* \~$1.1B in DFU diagnostics

📌 **SAM for Spectral AI**:  
👉 **$1.7B–2B**, across U.S., military, EU, and select allied health systems

# 🧩 3. SOM – Serviceable Obtainable Market

**If Spectral AI captures just:**

* 5–10% of its SAM in 3–5 years = **$85M–$170M/year**
* Possible upside from U.S. military contracts, BARDA (already awarded), and potential foreign defense agencies

📌 **SOM (conservative projection)**:  
👉 **$85M–$170M annual revenue potential** within 5 years Ive seen this stock around for some time so u might think youre too late but your not. Its early and look at the potential market. I’m in the process of doing an analysis will probably post tomorrow, but I am very bullish on the FDA clearance. If it doesn’t clear than RIP but it’s looking incredible favorable with the added bonus of the new administration pushing fancy tech for healthcare and military operations. Saying wound care is a 14 billion market is nice and all, but that says nothing about their true tam.

1mh5dz8,2025-08-04,"BTBT & WYFI please come
IPO will be priced coming days. It's a carve-out IPO, and $BTBT owns 80%.

Bit Digital's (NASDAQ: $BTBT) AI infrastructure subsidiary WhiteFiber announced its initial public offering (IPO) on July 29, 2025, with the goal of listing 7.8 million shares under the "" $WYFI "" name on the Nasdaq at $15–$17 per share. 
This move, supported by its rapid growth from 1 to over 20 customers since early 2024, could unlock value for $BTBT shareholders through a spinoff that separates its AI segment.

1mh3i7l,2025-08-04,"$WATT: Energous is actually doing something
So $WATT has been pushing hard into this “Ambient IoT” thing. Basically battery‑free tags that get powered by RF, wifi, whatever, so you dont gotta swap batteries every few months

The one I'm ontomistic about is Battery free e‑Sense tags.  Launched June ‘25. 4x5cm waterproof tags, track temp + location in realtime, no battery. No current competition for this especially with dual temp sensors.

Full platform – PowerBridge (wireless power transmitters), e‑Sense tags (the sensors), e‑Compass (cloud software). Can scale to millions of tags in a warehouse.

Use case – Cuts battery maintance, constant tracking (better than just RFID pings).

Big names – Part of Ambient IoT Alliance w/ Qualcomm, Intel, PepsiCo, Wiliot, etc, I can only imagine the applications but for now warehouse and logistics kinda make sense.

Numbers – Q2 2025: record rev, smaller losses, backlog growing. I used chatgp to make a graph of their capex and income to show the direction. Don't judge me.


Why it matters: Ambient IoT is starting to get rolled out for real. $WATT now has a full system in market. If this sector takes off, they’re already in position. 

Not financial advice, DYOR. 
Full transparency, I added 100k at $0.4 after seeing the trend in revenue.

Two-pronged approach - In-vitro diagnostics (IVD) and research solutions. Projected market growth for diagnostics Technolgies and immunology research tools. The diagnostics market is projected to experience significant growth in the coming years. Here are some key insights into the market's projected growth:

These projections indicate a robust growth trajectory for the diagnostics market, driven by the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and the need for more accurate and timely diagnostic tests. The market's growth is expected to be supported by technological advancements, personalized medicine, and the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning into diagnostic processes.

I want to tie this above paragraph into the statement made by Virax's CEO Jomes Foster:

“As this new administration appears to enter a new era of vaccine transparency, we believe Virax Biolabs is well-positioned to provide additional critical, data-driven insights on vaccine efficacy to support existing and future vaccine development. We are fully aligned in supporting Public Health initiatives around Vaccine Efficacy Testing.""

This was said in regard to the change in the direction of the Robert Kennedy FDA. I will bring more about why I think this is significant later in this post.

Key Milestones for 2025 -2026

The commercialization of ViraxImmune reader instrument. Right now, ViraxImmune is research use only, and they expect to have it approved for clinical use this year.

In September of this year VRAX has a pre submission meeting with the FDA to align validation strategy and regulatory pathway.

They also have this ISO9001:2015QMSandISO9001 listed in their milestones.

I wasn't sure what it was, and I believe that it signifies their plan to work with International Management Systems Marketing. This is what their website says ISO 9001 is:

""ISO 9001 is the ultimate global benchmark for quality management and a critical tool for boosting your company’s success, profitability, and market potential.

ISO 9001 sets out the necessary steps to adopt a quality management system. It is designed to help organizations ensure they meet the needs and expectations of both customers and other interested parties, based on internationally recognized quality management principles set out by the [International Organization for Standardization (ISO)](https://www.iso.org/home.html).

ISO 9001 is one of the most widely used management tools globally, with over one million organizations certified. It is a ‘generic standard’ as it is designed to fit flexibility around any organization. Our consultants are there to help you identify what is relevant for your business, whatever the size or turnover.""

Seems like another indicator they are actively breaking into the US market. Whiles based in the UK, IMSM has had operations in the US for decades.

Now, I want to move on their financial position.

According to slide 13 at the end of March 2025, VRAX had 4.3Million cash on hand. Which is actually the same size of the float. 4.3Million. There are warrants but they are at $3.21 and then there are 500k outstanding options at $5.68. They have their expected monthly burn rate to be 220k/month.

If we do to math, 4.3million - 220k(3) because three moths have passed since March 31st, 2025.

That leaves us with 3,640,000. Divide that by 220k. That leaves VRAX with 16.5 months of runway with the cash they have on hand. BUT VRAX also says in the presentation that they expect RUO sales to exceed R&D costs in 2026.

Now I want to back track to why I brought up RFK and VRAX's signaling. I believe VRAX has been positioning itself for fast tracked FDA approval. I have several reasons I believe this.

1. Platform Technology with Public Health Utility

Virax’s ImmuneSelect platform isn’t tied to a single disease — it profiles T-cell responses across chronic inflammation, immune exhaustion, and post-viral syndromes like Long COVID. That flexibility aligns with Fast Track criteria, especially under RFK Jr.’s FDA, which favors:

* Preventive diagnostics over pharma-heavy therapeutics
* Cost-saving, scalable platforms
* Tools that support vaccine transparency and immune health

1. Alignment with HHS Vaccine Transparency Priorities

In February 2025, Virax publicly stated that its technology supports the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ push for vaccine efficacy transparency. That’s a direct nod to RFK Jr.’s regulatory agenda, and it positions Virax as a data-driven ally in public health.

3. Clinical Validation in UK Trials

Their ongoing UK NHS study is generating real-world data on immune dysfunction and post-viral syndromes. If conducted under Good Clinical Practice (GCP), this data could be accepted by the FDA — especially under Fast Track, which allows foreign trials if they’re relevant to U.S. populations.

4. Strategic Board Appointment

Virax recently added Dr. Iain Miller to its board — a diagnostics veteran with 20+ years of U.S. experience and a track record of securing UK government grants for infectious disease diagnostics. His expertise in regulatory navigation and reimbursement strategy strengthens Virax’s FDA playbook.

5. Public Messaging Signals

CEO James Foster has repeatedly emphasized:

* The importance of immune profiling in chronic illness
* The role of ViraxImmune in vaccine efficacy testing
* The company’s alignment with public health initiatives

I want to dig into their leadership, but this post is long already and I think I will leave that for another post.

Please everyone, let me know what you think.

1mgfqrj,2025-08-03,"HOPIUM (ALHPI.PA) – Microcap Hydrogen Play Trading Far Below Strategic Value
Key Highlights

	•	1:80 reverse stock split completed August 2025 → ultra-low float
	•	Proprietary 100–200kW fuel-cell technology validated and entering commercial phase
	•	Debt cut drastically post-restructuring, with operating costs reduced by over 60%
	•	€12.5M convertible funding secured until 2026 for scaling and operations
	•	Market cap < €2M despite validated tech and ongoing commercial discussions
	•	Active positioning across marine, logistics, and municipal retrofit sectors
	•	Strategic partnerships under discussion; multiple near-term catalysts on the horizon

Company Overview

Hopium is a French hydrogen technology company that recently pivoted from hydrogen vehicle manufacturing to supplying modular, high-performance fuel-cell systems for industrial and mobility sectors. It operates in a segment with growing demand, and its proprietary stacks have completed real-world testing in several use cases.
Following a successful corporate restructuring and August 2025 reverse split, Hopium now trades with a lean structure and is positioned for potential strategic moves.

Financial Setup

	•	Market capitalization: approx. €1.5–2M
	•	Debt: reduced to ~€9M (long-term, no near-term maturities)
	•	Funding: €12.5M convertible facility active through 2026
	•	Burn rate: ~€800K/month, fully covered short-term
	•	Revenues: minimal to date, but commercial pilots expected Q4 2025
	•	Net loss 2024: €10.5M vs €30.7M in 2023

Hopium is one of the few hydrogen tech companies in Europe trading at deep asset discount, with the entire IP, product, and platform valued below its replacement cost.


Strategic Optionality and Upcoming Catalysts

	•	Commercial launch of fuel-cell units expected within months
	•	Pilot programs reportedly underway in marine and public sanitation fleets
	•	Ongoing discussions with municipalities and logistics operators for retrofitting use cases
	•	Management actively pursuing industrial partnership to accelerate commercialization
	•	Potential eligibility for France2030 or EU clean-tech grants
	•	Legacy MoU with Crédit Agricole (10K hydrogen vehicles) may be restructured
	•	Exploring use of compact stacks in aerospace and hydrogen drones


Why It Matters Now

Hopium is currently priced as if it has no viable future. Yet the company:
	•	Has working technology in an expanding sector
	•	Has removed short-term debt risk
	•	Has financing in place and cost controls implemented
	•	Has early-stage commercial traction underway
	•	Has one of the lowest valuations among hydrogen tech companies globally

With a float compressed post-split and sentiment still flat, any material update—be it a customer agreement, a public subsidy, or a strategic JV—could lead to a sharp repricing.

Conclusion

Hopium offers a compelling case for investors seeking deep-value, high-risk/high-reward exposure to hydrogen infrastructure. The setup—clean structure, operational runway, validated IP, and multiple unpriced catalysts—makes it a microcap worth watching closely.

This is not financial advice. The risk is high, as with all early-stage deep-tech equities. But the asymmetry in valuation and optionality may appeal to investors focused on special situations and disruptive energy themes.
We can only hope that this company will make us any money. Good name Hopium, that shows your hope in this asset.

^(if) ^(you) ^(have) ^(any) ^(questions) ^(or) ^(concerns.) Not a good stock; the advantage of other fuel cell companies is that they can take any fuell , and are commercially viable. I would not invest in yhis stock. I am invested in Bloom Enery Ceres Cummins and Solaris. And how many times have we heard trading below value….so buy it. Would be meme funny Why did they go bankrupt initially? 
Is it still the same management team? They were spending too much on R&D without real revenues, equity and cash went negative. That R&D did lead to patents on their fuel cell tech. With a new CEO since 2024 they changed strategy: no more Machina car, now they focus on 100–400 kW fuel-cell modules for trucks, ships, and aircraft.

1mg5qtt,2025-08-03,"I asked ChatGPT ‘Biotech penny stock strategy’
A biotech penny stock strategy involves investing in low-priced, high-risk biotech companies—typically under $5 per share—with the aim of achieving large returns if a breakthrough drug or therapy is successful. However, it also carries very high risk due to regulatory hurdles, high R&D costs, and low success rates. Here’s a structured approach:

⸻

🔬 1. Focus on Clinical Pipeline
	•	Phase 2 & Phase 3 trials: Favor companies with drugs in later stages of clinical trials. Phase 3 is closest to FDA approval.
	•	Use clinical trial databases like ClinicalTrials.gov to verify drug stages.

⸻

🧾 2. Study FDA Calendar & Milestones
	•	Look for upcoming catalysts: PDUFA dates, trial data releases, Fast Track/Orphan Drug status.
	•	These events often cause big price swings (up or down).

⸻

📊 3. Check Financial Health
	•	Biotech penny stocks often burn cash fast. Look at:
	•	Cash runway: How many months of operations they can fund.
	•	Debt levels
	•	Recent offerings (dilution risk)

⸻

🧠 4. Assess Management & Partnerships
	•	Strong management with big pharma backgrounds is a green flag.
	•	Look for strategic collaborations with major pharma firms—this shows industry confidence.

⸻

📈 5. Follow Smart Money
	•	Track institutional investors, hedge funds, or insiders buying shares.
	•	Use 13F filings or insider trading reports to spot trends.

⸻

🔄 6. Diversify Small Positions
	•	Don’t go all-in. Invest small amounts in multiple biotech penny stocks to spread risk.
	•	Accept that many may fail; success of just 1-2 can make up for losses.

⸻

⚠️ 7. Be Ready for Volatility
	•	Biotech stocks can swing 30–100% in a day on news.
	•	Use stop-loss orders or be prepared to hold long-term.

⸻

[deleted] It should have said: wait until catalyst happens, scalp it for 10% and move on. 
That’s not bullshit. That’s my DD I made after 3 serious bong hits. [removed] In reality, it's a red or black roulette table with biotechs. They pop on phase 3 approvals huge, sometimes on really good phase 1-2. I have a lengthy medical background and for 5 to 6 years studied trials and invested in biotechs. I would study phase 1-2 trials that had amazing results, phase 3 sounded promising as it gets. 

And the results, pretty good, yet denied by FDA. They can be good and even better than the standard, yet are not approved because it didn't beat it by a landfall. And there you go, down 50% for that. Even with my medical background and seeing amazing phase 1-2 it meant nothing. Also have to wait for ages, I would often only search expected phase 3 trial date endings but it would sometimes still drag on. 

Unless you're investing in just better financials from phase 3 production starting or a company you think will get out of the red. You're just taking a gamble on the FDA being fair, which they really aren't. They protect the standard more than the new ones.

1mg1gju,2025-08-02,"BTAI - Upcoming Catalyst
Ticker: $BTAI
Sector: Biotech / Neuropsychiatry
Thesis: Significant upside potential ahead of key August catalysts — a strong setup for a breakout on compelling clinical and regulatory developments.

🔬 Company Overview

BioXcel Therapeutics (BTAI) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company using AI-based drug repurposing to develop therapies in neuroscience and immuno-oncology. Its lead asset, BXCL501 (Igalmi), is a sublingual film formulation of dexmedetomidine being developed for acute agitation in various psychiatric and neurological conditions.
The company already received FDA approval for BXCL501 for agitation associated with schizophrenia and bipolar I/II disorder. Now, it's aiming to expand the label significantly — and that’s where the August 2025 catalysts come in.

📅 Upcoming Catalysts

✅ 1. Data Readout – Q3 2025 (Expected early August)
BTAI is expected to release pivotal Phase 3 data any day now for BXCL501 in acute agitation related to Alzheimer’s-related dementia (AARD).
This is a high unmet need indication with no FDA-approved treatments. Positive data would solidify BXCL501 as the first and only noninvasive treatment for this population, greatly expanding its commercial potential.
Why it matters:

The AARD population is large and growing.
Caregivers and hospitals face limited options for managing agitation — often resorting to antipsychotics or physical restraints.
A positive readout could increase the addressable market by 3–5x.

🗓️ 2. Pre-NDA Meeting – August 20, 2025

The company has already requested a Pre-New Drug Application (Pre-NDA) meeting with the FDA for the dementia agitation indication.
This is a formal step toward regulatory approval, and a successful outcome (with FDA alignment) would allow BTAI to submit an NDA before year-end, triggering milestone payments and setting up for 2026 commercialization.

💡 Why This Setup is Bullish

Low Float + Short Interest
BTAI has a low float, and short interest remains elevated. A positive data readout can trigger a short squeeze in a thinly traded name.
Undervalued vs. Peak Sales Potential
Even a modest penetration into the dementia agitation market could drive $300M–$500M in annual sales, compared to a current market cap below $100M.

BXCL501’s platform potential (already FDA-approved) positions it well for label expansions with minimal clinical risk.

Derisked Mechanism
Dexmedetomidine’s safety profile is well-characterized, and BXCL501 has already been through multiple successful trials.

The regulatory path is well-defined, and BXCL501's success in prior CNS indications improves odds of FDA acceptance.
Strategic Optionality

A favorable meeting on August 20th opens the door for partnerships, licensing deals, or M&A interest.
The company previously guided that it intends to monetize the asset through ex-US partnerships, which may be announced post-readout.

🧠 Summary
BTAI presents a near-term, asymmetric risk/reward play with two major binary events in August: a high-impact data readout followed by a regulatory milestone. With a strong setup, derisked asset, and massive market opportunity, bulls are positioning for a breakout on positive news.

📊 Data readout (early August): High probability of success based on prior trials and unmet need.

🧾 Pre-NDA Meeting (Aug 20): Catalyst for de-risking FDA submission.

💰 Valuation upside: Potential for 3–5x re-rating if catalysts go well.

PT if successful: $8–$12 range

I looked into this after you mentioned it in lounge thanks for heads up. 
Planning to enter **$BTAI** on/if dips next week, all though not holding through announcements it’s been picking up steam on socials, hype train is starting. Hoping to cash out on anticipation 20-40%. 

Those price targets are unrealistic tbh imho, just by looking at recent FDA price movements. Thanks for the post. [deleted] \> PT if successful: $8–$12 range

Thanks chat gpt. But why not 9-13? Around how much would be yours expect dip? It’s a pump and dump. I used to work for this company. The trial is to expand the current indication and get rid of the monitoring requirement. Any positive news will swing in a positive direction but it won’t last. Lack of real world evidence and any updated guidelines for current treatment means prescriber uptick will be slow to minimal still. It’s at 1.37 right now and my average is 1.35 if you look at the 3 month chart it’s currently rising from a dip. My plan is to continuing holding until phase 3 news is released which should be done before August 20th. We already know this news to be good so I’m expecting a pump and that is when I plan to sell. I don’t plan to take the gamble in holding this for the August 20th FDA I agree but the data wasn't released , only that it was completed. Independent comparative trials against stand of practice for treating this indication. Doctors practice evidence based medicine so they go by guidelines on how to treat. Right now this medication isn’t in any guidelines or have any independent studies Similar to Clonidine, Guanfacine -- both used to treat hypertension, AD/HD, agitation -- and both decades old.  Also, similar to Tizanidine -- used as a muscle relaxant and off-label to treat nightmares.

Biggest issue with all these medications is orthostatic hypotension (fainting when standing).

Dexmedetomidine is the most expensive of the bunch -- you can get 270, .1 mg Clonidine tablets at Walmart for $10.00 (a tad more if you have a sales tax :)).

Plus, you shouldn't prescribe any two of these to the same patient concurrently.

I don't see an amazing market here--more than what it already has. $BTAI H.C Wainwright reiterated buy and price target $8

1mfj38r,2025-08-02,"Iterum therapeutics $.73 ready for $10 🚀 commercialization of Orlynvah, REASSURE, Corey Fishman
**** 🚨WATCH $ITRM MONDAY MOVEMENT! Tuesday 8:30a.m. premarket earnings call****
**research CEO Corey Fishmans
Upcoming Event: Q2 2025 Earnings
	•	Iterum will report its second-quarter 2025 financial results on Tuesday, August 5, 2025, before the U.S. market opens.
	•	A conference call is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. ET, with domestic/international access codes provided and a webcast available post-event via the company’s investor site  ￼.

👤 New Commercial Lead
	•	Effective June 30, 2025, Christine Coyne was appointed as Chief Commercial Officer, tasked with leading the U.S. launch of ORLYNVAH™ and broader commercial strategy  ￼.
	•	On July 1, she received a stock option grant enabling purchase of 200,000 ordinary shares at an exercise price of $0.97/share under Nasdaq inducement rules  ￼.

🧪 Clinical Trial Results Published
	•	On June 25, 2025, results from the REASSURE Phase 3 trial were published in NEJM Evidence, showing oral sulopenem (ORLYNVAH™) was non‑inferior and statistically superior to Augmentin in treating uncomplicated UTIs in adult women.
	•	About 9.2% of participants had pathogens resistant to three or more antibiotic classes; overall treatment success was 61.7% vs. 55.0% with Augmentin  ￼.

🚀 Commercialization Partnership
	•	Iterum has partnered with EVERSANA Life Science Services to handle U.S. commercialization for ORLYNVAH™, targeting a market launch by Q4 2025. EVERSANA will manage sales operations, marketing, regulatory, logistics, and medical affairs  ￼.

💬 FDA Approval & Regulatory Extension
	•	The FDA approved ORLYNVAH™ (oral sulopenem) on October 25, 2024 for treating uncomplicated UTIs in adult women with limited oral treatment options. The launch is slated for mid‑2025  

🚀 Iterum is building momentum: FDA-approved ORLYNVAH™, promising Phase 3 data published, leadership team assembled, commercialization partnership in place, and a Q2 earnings call scheduled to discuss next steps. The company appears poised for U.S. launch in late 2025 and is working to extend its financial flexibility into 2026 and beyond.

👨‍🏫
Why Some Physicians May Prefer ORLYNVAH

1.	⁠Resistance Landscape •	ORLYNVAH is the first oral penem approved in the U.S., targeting resistant pathogens like ESBL- or AmpC-producing organisms that are unaffected by amoxicillin-based therapies  ￼. •	In SURE‑1, ORLYNVAH outperformed ciprofloxacin in fluoroquinolone-resistant infections (62.6% vs. 36.0%)—though in ciprofloxacin-susceptible cases, it was non‑inferior but not superior  ￼.
2.	⁠Oral Option vs. IV Therapies •	For patients with multidrug-resistant pathogens who otherwise would need IV antibiotics, ORLYNVAH offers a home-based oral alternative, helping reduce hospitalization and complexity of care  ￼ ￼.

Here’s a clearer look at Corey N. Fishman, CEO of Iterum, and his track record with prior companies:

🧠 Career Highlights

Durata Therapeutics (2010–2015) •	Served as CFO and COO, overseeing finance, operations, strategy, business development, international operations, and portfolio oversight. •	Raised over $225 million through a successful IPO and follow-on offering. •	Led Durata’s sale to Actavis plc in 2014 for approximately $675M in equity value. ￼ ￼

Meda/MedPointe (2002–2008) •	Became CFO in 2006 at MedPointe (private equity-backed), leading finance, strategy, debt restructuring, portfolio optimization, and multiple line extensions. •	Oversaw the company’s eventual sale to Meda AB. ￼

Ganic Pharmaceuticals (2008–2010) •	CFO at this Warburg Pincus-backed company (details limited); served as an earlier stepping stone in his pharmaceutical finance career. ￼ ￼

📌 Board Roles Illustrating Influence •	Momenta Pharmaceuticals: Appointed to the board in 2016. Momenta was later acquired by Johnson & Johnson in late 2020. ￼ •	BioSpecifics Technologies: Joined the board in 2020, prior to its eventual acquisition by Endo International plc.

Company Role Key Outcome Durata Therapeutics CFO / COO Raised significant capital; sold to Actavis for ~$675M MedPointe / Meda CFO Led strategic turnaround and successful M&A exit Board Roles Momenta & BioSpecifics Both companies acquired by large pharma players Iterum Therapeutics Founder & CEO Secured FDA approval for ORLYNVAH™ and preparing for commercial launch

✅ Bottom Line

Corey Fishman’s track record is strong: from capital raises and successful IPOs to orchestrating M&A exits in the specialty pharma space. He has repeatedly navigated companies from financing stages through exits or acquisitions. Now at Iterum, he is executing a similar playbook—achieving FDA approval and gearing up for commercialization.

• voting on 9 proposals during September 10th shareholders meeting. 
•extremely profitable and marketable product for investing companies interested 
•  the entire team is already successful, with reputable references,
• already completed & foreseen multiple (5-6) different companies,  drug approvals, multiple successful launches & sales to major pharmaceutical companies . 
•The sheer amount of women patients orlynvah will treat more comfortably & effectively. Considering it’s the ONLY one ☝️ of its kind with FDA approval in the United States. I believe doctors/investors are already anticipating  the release of orlynvah, given the increased amount of untreated UTIs, and ineffectiveness of augmentin.



“You are cordially invited to the 2025 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of Iterum Therapeutics plc, an Irish public limited company (the “Company”) to be held at 25 North Wall Quay, Dublin 1, D01 H104, Ireland on September 10, 2025 at 3.00 p.m., Irish time (10.00 a.m., Eastern Time).

8.receive and consider the Company’s Irish Statutory Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 and the reports of the directors and auditors thereon, and review the affairs of the Company; and

9. consider any other business properly brought before the 2025 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders or any adjournment or postponement thereof.
Our board of directors unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” Proposal Nos. 1 through 7 as set forth in the proxy statement.
We hope that you will participate in the meeting by voting through acceptable means as described in this proxy statement as promptly as possible. Your vote is important – so please exercise your right. 
 
Sincerely, Corey N. Fishman”

August 5th, 2025
🚨 🚨 
Iterum Therapeutics is preparing for a significant milestone with the upcoming launch of ORLYNVAH™, the first FDA-approved oral penem antibiotic in the U.S. and first branded treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTIs) in over 25 years. This launch, expected in AUGUST 2025, addresses a critical medical need as antimicrobial resistance has rendered many generic treatments ineffective.

The company has established key commercial infrastructure through its partnership with EVERSANA for U.S. commercialization services and secured manufacturing through ACS Dobfar. These partnerships, along with hiring a Chief Commercial Officer, position Iterum for its commercial transition.

They’ve announced TODAY that their new medicine orlynvah will launch THIS month. Which is actually ahead of schedule. Extremely transparent 

✅ Positive
✅ First branded antibiotic for uUTIs in 25+ years launching August 2025
✅ Strategic partnership with EVERSANA for U.S. 
✅ commercialization secured
Manufacturing agreement with ACS Dobfar S.p.A 
✅ established
Canadian patent protection extended until 2039
✅ Pfizer debt repayment extended to October 2029
Cash runway extended into 2026


🚨 Negative
Net loss increased to $6.5M in Q2 2025 from $5.0M in Q2 2024
General and administrative expenses more than doubled to $4.2M from $1.9M YoY
Limited cash position of $13.0M requiring additional ATM offering

Who else is ALREADY holding a bag?
I hate these chatGPT low effort posts. 4. Create an additional 80,000,000 shares

No thanks No you didn’t. My welcome? phase 3 results in june and why this stock barely move after(and prior) to the release. So they only have outstanding shares totaling 42.6 million then they are adding 80 million shares 

At fridays closing price, that equates to a new price of 0.254 if they issued all at once, which I don't think will happen, but in the end, that's the math Nah ah. Bold of you to assume i can read. This stood out to me also. Along with a couple of other proposals that followed after #4

On the surface, I agree this new product as amazing potential, but my concern is when will it be safe to get in and avoid the inevitable fall in stock price once all 80 million shares have been issued $9,000 for 1 dose.

1meaidc,2025-07-31,"Why I’m Watching $BEEM — A Deep Dive into a Small-Cap EV/ESS Play with Asymmetric Upside
Hey everyone, long-time opportunity investor here. I’m a career scientist in the U.S. government research sphere, so I live and breathe technology road-mapping. On the investing side, I flagged PLTR in late-2020 (sub-$10) and NVDA before its 2023 AI melt-up both calls well documented in my post history. That mix of deep-tech insight and hands-on government procurement experience is exactly why Beam Global ($BEEM) grabbed my attention.


1. What They Do

Beam Global makes off-grid solar EV charging and energy storage solutions. Their flagship EV ARC™ stations are portable, self-powered chargers that can be dropped into a parking lot without any trenching, utility permitting, or demand charges.

Mission: Enable clean mobility and resilient energy infrastructure.

Edge: They live in a niche between big on-grid players (ChargePoint, ABB) and the coming EV infrastructure boom — off-grid means fast deployment and no grid upgrade delays.

Optionality: Their battery division (via AllCell) gives them exposure to telecom, micro-grid, and defense energy storage markets.


2. Leadership Matters

CEO Desmond Wheatley has been with Beam since 2010, CEO since 2011.

He’s navigated multiple uplists, acquisitions, and non-dilutive financing rounds — exactly what you want in a micro-cap growth story.

Insider ownership is 13.3%, which is meaningful for a company this size. Alignment is there.


3. Financial Snapshot (FY-2024 / TTM)

Revenue: $49.3M (down YoY from $67M, but still 2× 2022 levels)

Gross Margin: 15% GAAP / 21% adj. (vs 2% last year — massive improvement)

Cash Burn: $2.2M from ops, down 80% YoY

Balance Sheet: $4.6M cash, zero debt, and a $100M untapped credit line

Valuation: ~$36M market cap → 0.84× TTM sales vs peers at 3–5×


Beam’s quarter-to-quarter numbers are lumpy (government contracts), but the trend toward positive cash flow and gross margin expansion is real.


4. Why I Like It

Here’s my investment thesis in plain English:

Asymmetric upside: Sub-1× sales for a clean-tech hardware company with IP and 60% 5Y CAGR is rare.

Clear path to profitability: Margins jumped from 2% to 15% GAAP in one year — scaling ops are working.

Policy tailwinds: IRA, NEVI, EU Fit-for-55 — everything is screaming for solar+storage and grid-resilient charging.

Unique niche: “Plug-and-play” off-grid chargers solve the #1 EV adoption headache: infrastructure bottlenecks.

Diversification beyond EVs: Energy storage and micro-grids could unlock entirely new revenue streams.

Just exanded to Middle East With New Abu Dhabi Venture for EV and Energy Tech

21% ESS Revenue Growth reported last week.

Just signed $2M order and signed 3 new clients including fortune 500 company.

Analyst consensus PT is ~$17 (≈7× current price). Even partial execution gets you a 2–3× scenario in 2–3 years.


5. Key Risks

Revenue volatility: Federal/municipal contracts can make quarters look feast-or-famine.

Small-cap swings: $36M market cap, beta 2.2 — not for weak hands.

Execution risk: Scaling to $200M+ revenue will test supply chain and working capital.

Policy dependency: A shift in government incentives could slow orders.

6. TL;DR

I see Beam Global ($BEEM) as a speculative but fundamentally de-risked small cap sitting right in front of a macro tailwind. They have no debt, growing margins, a differentiated product, and exposure to two secular trends: EV infrastructure and distributed energy storage.

Not financial advice — but I like buying companies before Wall Street cares. This is one of those “get paid for being early” setups if management executes.

Position :10,000 shares @2.32.
What would you reckon on a good entry and exit position be? sounds interesting.

I had put it on my watchlist and looking to buy in around $2 Chart is consolidating after a great move

1me6y50,2025-07-31,"$FNM - First Nordic Metals just closed a C$15.4M LIFE financing
I've been watching First Nordic Metals (FNM) and just saw they **closed a $15.4 million raise** at **$0.37 per unit**. Its LIFE financing so theres no hold period which is always nice. 

The stock has been **drifting down a bit over the last few months** so this financing at a relatively low price might be pretty smart. 

I’m paying attention because:

* Theyre focused on Sweden and Finland two stable and resource-rich regions that are still underexplored in terms of critical minerals. Frasier institute just ranked theze countries 1st and 6th ([https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/2025-07/annual-survey-of-mining-companies-2024.pdf](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/2025-07/annual-survey-of-mining-companies-2024.pdf))
* The oversubscription suggests institutional players see upside potential.
* It’s still trading around the financing level so it could be an interesting entry if you believe in the exploration thesis. My view is very long term

Obviously it’s still earlystage and theres execution risk like with any explorer. But with this cash in the bank they have some breathing room to put out real results.

Was always fascinated bout Nordic stories, maybe im biased because we don't have that many interesting mining companies to go around in Europe.

1me2i69,2025-07-31,"GORO : Gold Resource Corporation Reports H1 2025 Drilling Results and Operational Improvements at the Don David Gold Mine
DENVER--([BUSINESS WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com/))--**Gold Resource Corporation (NYSE American: GORO)** (“we,” “us,” “our” or the “**Company**”) is pleased to report highlights to date from its 2025 underground drilling campaign and provide an operational update from the Company’s Don David Gold Mine (“DDGM”) in Oaxaca, Mexico.

**Highlights**

* Drill results from the new Three Sisters Vein System continue to return consistent results that indicate good width and grades that indicate potentially higher Net Smelter Return^(1) values (“NSR”).
* The Company has engaged Cominvi Servicios S.A. de C.V an experienced underground mining contractor, with the benefit of their new mining equipment, to accelerate the development and access into the higher grade Three Sisters vein systems. Since May, more than 1,350 meters of development, including ramps and drifts, have been completed.
* The Company has begun using cut-and-fill mining methods in select areas of the mine to reduce dilution and increase the run of mine average grade and returns.
* A third dry stack filter press has been ordered for the processing plant to increase throughput and returns.
* Orders are in for good used equipment to replace some of our own older underground fleet. This will reduce maintenance costs and improve our productivity.
* The process plant is under a full review to the goal to further optimize reagent use and increase recoveries and payable metals. Initial trials already indicate the potential for promising returns.

**2025 DRILLING SUMMARY**

During the first half of 2025, the underground diamond drill program focused on ore definition and grade-control within the Three Sisters vein system, as well as in select veins of the Arista system. Significant vein widths and grades were encountered and reinforce the potential for the Three Sisters and Gloria vein systems to be a third major mineralized vein system strategically located between and north of the Arista and Switchback systems.

“Consistent high-grade drill intercepts, along with an improved understanding of the geology, have allowed us to build more confidence in the mine plan of the Three Sisters system and reinforcing its role as a key contributor to future mine production,” stated Allen Palmiere, President and CEO of the Company. “In addition, we are excited about the potential benefits from bringing in an experienced mining contractor along with their new equipment, while changing out some of our old fleet with good used equipment to improve our efficiencies and returns. We remain focused on integrating the Three Sisters system into our short-term mine plan while continuing to advance exploration efforts aimed at driving sustainable growth and maximizing shareholder value.”

The drill result highlights presented in this press release further demonstrate the growing potential of these vein systems. The Company believes the mine has significant potential to generate positive cash flow from the newly defined Three Sisters and Gloria vein systems, as well as from additional zones recently identified near existing mining areas in both the Arista and Switchback systems. The Three Sisters and Gloria vein systems are easier to access, located near the current mine portal and at significantly higher elevations than those of other production areas and will result in reduced haulage distances and costs. To support access and continued definition of these areas, targeted investment in underground development and equipment has been initiated, including the engagement of a contract miner in Q2 2025 and the sourcing of lightly used underground mining equipment.

**2025 Drill Results and Program:** Through the first half of 2025, a total of 51 underground definition and ore-control drill holes, totaling 6,615 meters of diamond drilling, have been completed at DDGM. The program continues to deliver high-grade intercepts that confirm the continuity and quality of the mineralization. These results have further defined the geologic model for the Three Sisters and Gloria vein systems, while also upgrading mineral resources within select veins of the Arista system. The Company plans to initiate additional exploration development in the second half of 2025 to support further infill and expansion drilling, particularly to the northwest of the currently defined extents of the Three Sisters – Gloria zone.

Selected grade-control drill results from the first half of 2025 at the Three Sisters vein system are presented below. Intercepts are reported as Estimated True Widths^(2) (“ETW”) and include Gold Equivalent^(3) grades (“AuEq”) and NSR.

1mdwwqy,2025-07-31,"How Graphene Could Revolutionize Artificial Intelligence
I was convinced early on about graphene’s future as a wonder material. But it wasn’t until Dr. Sorensen exploded onto the scene (pun intended)

with his discovery that the scalability, and consistency of graphene production could be achieved.



Now with so many uses being discovered everyday for graphene AI is about to supercharge its uses. I came across this article and sums up so many things about how graphene will change the world.



Unfortunately its author was not provided in the article in March 2024.

Artificial intelligence is on a tear, transforming industries and reshaping our world. But behind the scenes, a tiny, one-atom-thick material could be the key to unlocking even more powerful AI: graphene.

For decades, silicon has faithfully served as the workhorse of the tech world. But as AI algorithms become more complex, silicon chips are starting to strain under the immense processing power required. Enter graphene, a marvel of material science with properties that could leave silicon in the dust.

Imagine an information highway for electrons. Silicon is a bumpy, congested road, while graphene is a smooth, six-lane superhighway. Electrons in graphene zip along at much faster speeds, translating to AI systems that can crunch data and learn exponentially quicker. This translates to real-world benefits: faster medical diagnoses, more efficient self-driving cars, and even a potential leap forward in natural language processing, bringing us closer to truly human-like AI interactions, even surpassing the capabilities of current models like ChatGPT and Google Gemini.

But graphene’s brilliance doesn’t stop there. Unlike silicon, graphene is an excellent conductor of heat. This means AI systems built on graphene chips wouldn’t overheat, a major bottleneck for current silicon-based systems. Imagine cramming more processing power into a smaller space without worrying about meltdowns – that’s the kind of design flexibility graphene offers. This increased processing power could significantly enhance the capabilities of an AI applications like an AI image generator and AI video generator, enabling them to create even more realistic and sophisticated content.

The road to a graphene revolution isn’t without its bumps. Mass production of high-quality graphene remains a challenge. But researchers are making significant strides. Recent breakthroughs, like the creation of the first functional graphene processor, demonstrate the immense potential.

The stakes are high. The first company to crack the graphene code for AI could establish a dominant position in the race towards next-generation computing. Investors are taking notice, pouring funds into research and development. The race is on, and the winner could redefine the future of AI.



So, the next time you hear about a mind-blowing AI feat, remember the invisible hero behind the scenes – graphene. It’s a revolution waiting to happen, and it could change the face of AI forever.
Hydrograph clean power (HGRAF). I've listened to hours about this company and I like what I've heard. The CEO, Kirstin Bruere, sounds very competent and aware of future challenges. The inventor, Dr. Chris Sorensen, goes into fine detail of what makes graphene applications so massive for it's potential. Kerry Landis is a nuclear engineer that is invested in hydrograph and he covers the potential for nuclear applications. All those videos are available for your own DD on YouTube. I'm an investor, but just a little guy. I like the story. So at best this is a gamble on a pipe dream of an idea, we aren’t even to gambling on scaling yet. Has grapheme been used in a production chip used in “AI” at any scale beyond prototype? Graphene really does seem like a game-changer for AI. Its speed and heat conductivity could solve so many of the current limitations in processing power. The possibilities for more efficient and advanced AI are exciting, but it’s clear there are still some hurdles to overcome. Looking forward to seeing how it evolves! I believe Graphene will be one of the top three materials in the future. It’ll be used in damn near everything, potentially even semiconductors. It has almost otherworldly properties and characteristics. 

That could still be 20-30 years away sadly. It will hit one day and if you pick right it’ll be like getting Apple stock at .75 back in the day.  

I don’t see a stock currently that seems to have potential tho. Ngl he might be onto something :


- looking at his post history he has been into graphene for at least 3 years, wouldnt ne surprised if OP was working in something related to graphene.


- the company DD is not very convincing, but the hypothesis is valid and the stock still has room to grow, the recent jump shows there is interest in it. Honestly, i see why one can predict a bullish case here.


However as friday was tough for the markets as a whole, I am more scared of a conjonctural shift on monday, which will result in a bear market.

1mdw89f,2025-07-31,"$TPIC: Can pop like a MEME, though definitely not a MEME
TPI Composites (TPIC) has been left for dead, and rightfully so. Its balance sheet is a mess, profitability non-existent. Its sector is facing headwinds as far as the eye can see.* The current board members and CEO who have been around since pre-Covid have presided over enormous value destruction for a company which had a market cap hovering around $1 billion (from its 2016 listing to the start of Covid) to its current paltry $50 million.

And yet…

TPIC possesses extraordinary “franchise value.”  Here’s a company that is a global leader in the manufacturing of onshore composite wind blades. Ex-China, TPIC has a 27% global market share in 2024 (used to be >30% in the few years prior). Almost all of the world’s largest wind turbine OEMs are its customers (GE Vernova, Nordex, Vestas, etc.). This is an important player in the global supply chain for the energy of the future. This is NOT some company that churns out “me too” products or services in a highly fragmented industry. The strategic value of TPIC is huge!

The barriers to entry to produce cutting edge wind blades is insanely high. Think material complexity (complex chemistry and lay-up precision, small defects in air pockets and misaligned fibers can have catastrophic failure), extreme sizes (fabricating massive, lightweight, and aerodynamic components), structural engineering demands (light enough to spin effectively but strong enough to avoid fatigue or fracture), and limited automation (because of customized features). TPIC has had 24 years to perfect its craft since 2001. 

The company is in the process of evaluating its strategic options. At its core, the board and management made a mistake in issuing recklessly expensive preferred equity from Oaktree in late 2021—I think they panicked when they saw profitability vanished in the aftermath of Covid amidst supply chain issues, and worried about liquidity. By 2023, they had restructured the preferreds into a term loan carrying an all-in cost of 20% (11% coupon + 9% PIK). Only very few companies can withstand 20% cost of debt; TPIC with its historically modest profit margins isn’t one of them. Furthermore, the PIK made the board and management complacent. 

The hostility by the current administration towards anything renewables certainly makes things worse. Investor and sell-side analyst sentiment is clearly in the dog house. Pre-November 5, 2024 the share price was still trading in the $3 - $5/share range. Since then, it has spent some long portions of time below $1.

But I think Mr. Market is wrong.

A strong strategic investor who has a firm belief in the inexorable march towards a cleaner energy future will see a rare opportunity in TPIC. 

My thoughts on TPIC’s current value is as follows…

With the exception of last year ($1.3 billion), TPIC’s net annual revenues between 2019 to 2023 has been in the range of $1.4 to $1.7 billion. This year it is projected between $1.4 to $1.5 billion. During its periods of profitability, TPIC has achieved high-single digit adj-EBITDA margins. If we assume a 7% long-term adj-EBITDA margin off $1.4 billion (base-case long-term revenue run-rate, no growth), we get approximately $100 million in adj-EBITDA. If we apply a 7x EV/EBITDA multiple (average from other sources including Statista indicates a median of low teens EV/EBITDA multiple, https://www.enerdatics.com/insights/renewable-energy-m-a-pe-firms-are-dominating-acquisitions-of-renewables-developers-at-attractive-ev-ebitda-multiples), we get $700 million in enterprise value. Less the net debt of $400 million as of 1Q25, we get an equity value of $300 million (which equates to around $6/share), a far cry from the current market cap of around $50 million.

Again, the above assumes that TPIC can get to long-term, steady state—albeit no growth, profitability. The market says TPIC can’t get there, and I agree, IF it seeks to get there on its own. But if it gets acquired by a strong strategic player (think GE Vernova (market cap $178 billion as of 7/30/25) or Vestas, or Berkshire Hathaway Energy), TPIC has a strong pathway back towards relevance as it waits out the current headwinds being protected by a very strong parent.

The market is freaking out when it looks at the negative $400 million in book value and $400 million in net debt, with most of that debt being Oaktree’s 20% stiffer. But to a strong strategic acquirer with investment grade rating, it can easily refinance all that debt to a high single digit cost, shaving low teens in interest (say a 12% saving off $400 million is $48 million straight to the bottom line!). Also, buying at a $300 million valuation when book equity is negative $400 million will create $700 million in goodwill, which can be amortized (assuming certain purchase method employed, like an asset sale). At 20% tax rate and TPIC absorbed into the acquirer’s profitable operations, this creates $140 million in tax savings (20% x $700 million), albeit amortized over probably more than 10 years, but still meaningful!

The market is saying that the most simple way for TPIC to survive is to massively dilute existing shareholders at current market prices (<$1/share). True, that is the easiest way, but it is also the laziest and most incompetent way for the board to maximize shareholder value—although I have to admit, this is a risk.** To maximize shareholder value, there is no other way out except running into the arms of a strong strategic parent. And again, TPIC has announced that it is in the process of evaluating its strategic options (it has recently added 2 new board members with strong restructuring expertise). Can any strategic acquirer wait for the company to get into more trouble before making a move? It certainly can, but why risk further deterioration in operations, morale, and financial conditions when the company is already priced for bankruptcy?

Keep in mind that TPIC’s current single largest shareholder is the company’s Turkish partner (Dere Construction and its chairman, collectively “Dere"") with a 25% stake at a total cost of $2.4/share. I think that as a recent acquirer who has issued a 13-D filling with an intention to control, it will try very hard to protect its investment from going under. In fact, TPIC has gone silent in issuing a date for its 2024 AGM (the 2023 AGM took place on 5/29/24); ditto for announcing the date for its 2Q25 earnings results. Dere and TPIC had previously entered into a cooperation agreement which has since lapsed, and I suspect they have not been able to come to terms. If I were Dere, I will make sure that the board and senior management do what is right for its existing shareholders, at all cost.

Then there is the issue of TPIC’s short interest. As of 7/30/25, borrowing rates hover around 40%. Short interest is around 6 million shares, which represents around 18% of the 33 million free float. With 3-mo average daily volume of around 600k shares, that is around 10 days to cover. It will be interesting to see that assuming TPIC gets sold at fair value (say $6/share and above), what kind of a squeeze we can expect!

To recap:
- TPIC has incredible franchise value / strategic value.
- The market is forgetting that. The market figures the easiest way to salvage value is to issue cheap equity to pay down debt.
- If TPIC does the right thing and sells itself at fair value, the stock should pop.
- With a potential short squeeze, it can get even higher: like a MEME, though definitely NOT a MEME!

NOTE: THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, NOR A RALLYING CRY FOR COORDINATED ACTION. I THINK THE MARKET MAY HAVE MISSED SOMETHING, BUT THEN AGAIN I MAY BE WRONG—DUH. DO YOUR OWN DUE DILIGENCE.

* Well, actually not that far, but our recency bias makes it feel that way.

** The risk here is that the board with certain senior management act with vested interest to preserve their own perverse incentives. The recent authorization of retention bonuses to senior management by the board’s compensation committee does not look good.

1mdnsxc,2025-07-31,"Why I’m in CGTX — and it’s not because it’s a “penny stock”
Let me be clear: I didn’t buy into CGTX because it was cheap. I’m not chasing pennies or looking for lotto tickets. I’m here because the science, endpoints, and biomarker data stand out in a field filled with hype, failures, and dangerous side effects.

CT1812 (zervimesine) is one of the few Alzheimer’s drugs showing cognitive impact without amyloid clearance — meaning no brain bleeds, no MRIs, no black box risk. SHIMMER hit its endpoints. The plasma p-tau217 targeting shows clear directionality. They’re not just throwing stuff at the wall — they’re tracking measurable biomarkers linked to disease progression.

FDA already accepted their Phase 3 design. NIH is backing a major trial. The AAIC 2025 data was real — even if the market didn’t care yet. That disconnect is why I’m here.

Not pumping. Not predicting. But if you’re here for price alone, you’re missing the point. The value is in the mechanism, not the quote.

Do your own research, think for yourself
I’ve been in it for three weeks. Please tell me it’s going to do something. Same. Sold half of my position for the average cost, keeping the other half for now. The type of treatment they are proposing is for a very scary diseases that currently doesn’t have a lot of options.  So once they announce phase 3, and go through all those motions if they have a positive outcome it’ll be a great thing overall not just stock wise.

Also remember each step in phase 3 will have a public announcement so spiking the stock.  

It’s great some people sold at the latest pump and now it’s lower you can buy back in but make no mistake they will enter phase 3. 1500 @ .32. Not much but i’m with you. I hear you. I’m in the same boat — not here because it’s under a buck, but because the *mechanism, endpoints, and biomarker data* actually matter.

They’re targeting p-tau217 and showing neuroprotection without the bleeding risks that come with plaque-clearing drugs. SHIMMER hit its endpoints, FDA accepted the Phase 3 design, and the NIH is backing their next trial.

The price action sucks, yeah. But if the data holds and they land the right partnership or designation, this could move hard. Not guaranteed — but this isn’t hype, it’s real science. That’s why I’m here. 

You have to wait for the release of the FDA minutes and stage 3 to start So what is the probability that it will be successful for phase 3? Willing to bet big? Your a smarter man than I am I have 1,600 shares @.55. Why is it keep going down?  I totally agree with you. Science is progressing and CT1812 will truly be a medicine that will change people's lives as well as the Alzheimer's sector. The fundamentals of Zervemisina are quite solid, pointing to a reduction of between 95% and 129%, mainly for Lewey Body Dementia. This stock will bring MANY RETURNS in the medium term. It is necessary to give it time to enter phase 3 and from there it can move towards mass production of the medicine. Good News for CGTX Investors After Q2 Results Release: Lisa Ricciardi issued the following statement: “Later this month, we expect to receive the FDA minutes from our Phase 2 closeout meeting regarding the registration plans for zervimesine in Alzheimer’s disease. We hope this confirms our understanding of the Agency’s expectations for a clinical program in Alzheimer’s disease,” Ms. Ricciardi added. “Furthermore, we expect the FDA to make a decision on Breakthrough Drug Designation for zervimesine in Alzheimer’s disease in the third quarter of 2025. We hope these milestones will be valuable to potential partners as we continue to evaluate our options to support the development of zervimesine.”

1mdawys,2025-07-30,"PEW: Strong Fundamentals, Tight Float, Big Catalyst Ahead
I have been looking into PEW recently and started accumulating shares.

Unlike 90%+ of SPAC names, PEW posts positive net income. ~$100M cash on the books, with no debt.
Inventory and other tangible assets provide a real floor value.

Q1 revenue rose 12.3% YoY with a TTM revenue of $116.45 million, and Q2 earnings which is at Aug 14 will probably normalize margins now that SPAC costs are behind them.

This combination (profitability + cash + growth) is pretty unheard of in SPACS.
Most investors lump all SPACs together and ignore the few that actually have strong fundamentals. That’s an opportunity IMO. 

At current levels $6, the market values PEW close to its cash on hand and assigning almost no value to the business itself.

Alongside solid fundamentals, there’s a technical setup shorts are ignoring:

Institutions & insiders control ~88% of shares, Short interest is ~15% (~2.6M shares), Retail controls the rest, meaning tradable float is razor thin, Ownership claims exceed 100% of float, creating a negative float dynamic.

Now, Donald jr. is a 1% owner and on the board of this company. Which is a negative and positive. His presence may alienate certain investors or funds with ESG or politically neutral mandates. But also junior’s network opens doors to potential government contracts, partnerships, and favorable regulatory treatment. especially under a this administration.

PEW is  a profitable, cash heavy company with a share structure that could turn volatile real fast. With Q2 earnings around the corner and potential political tailwinds in play, the current price doesn’t reflect what is under the hood.
It’s minimum a $15 stock without fomo and without new catalyst. Imagine with fomo and new catalysts This will have another dip you will be able to accumulate shares at the $5.80 price range Ohhh, hell yeah, I love catching falling knives.  Just throw up like a dozen and I will happily run around like a little girl in a sprinkler trying to catch them all... https://preview.redd.it/7mp878iqi1gf1.jpeg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ac3013bf9b9326c3f2956d27ac375a1f8a816538 PEW, the widowmaker. You don’t have to buy in right now or at all. Once it’s up 20% or consolidated in a while it’s still a great opportunity. I was just talking about the financials. But thanks for your insights. Yes I’m currently at 2800 shares and the dips weren’t as big as I hoped in the last days. But I want to end up with 5k shares. So I’ll be buying on a little bit of a tighter spread upcoming days/week Spacs dropping well below 10 is very common after the merger. They go very volatile in one direction or the other. Because this one was already up 240% before the merger and shorts and puts could get with not a lot of risk they got the momentum going all the way into oversold territory. It’s all about timing. this is not financial advice of course. A 100 million revenue per year with 4 employees is impressive! But unfortunately you’re wrong.

1md9jje,2025-07-30,"Formation Metals (FOMO Stock) Powers Up: Gold, Nickel, and More For a Clean Energy Future
**Formation Metals Inc.** (CSE:**FOMO**, OTCPK:**FOMTF**, FSE:**VF1**) is a Canadian exploration company focused on supplying minerals essential to modern technology and clean energy. While much attention has been given to its gold assets, the company is also advancing exploration for copper, zinc, nickel, and titanium. This multi-metal approach supports North America’s growing need for critical minerals and positions the company for long-term growth as demand continues to rise.

**Mining More Than Gold: Why FOMO’s Metals Mix Matters**

Critical minerals are vital to industries such as electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy, electronics, and national defense. Gold is used in electronics and valued as a store of wealth. Copper and zinc are essential for wiring, batteries, and large infrastructure projects. 

Nickel is a key ingredient in EV batteries, and demand for it could nearly double by 2030. From 2017 to 2022, the percentage of nickel used in batteries rose from 6% to 16%. Titanium, known for its strength and lightweight, plays an important role in aerospace and advanced manufacturing.

https://preview.redd.it/1s8g7qgk41gf1.jpg?width=1135&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef03dafddba39926ca2b012620fa1837ee9aeadb

Governments in Canada and the United States have identified these minerals as strategic resources. With growing pressure to build secure, local supply chains for clean energy, both countries are actively supporting domestic exploration and development of critical minerals. 

Canada, for instance, is the fourth-largest global producer of nickel and fifth in titanium. In 2024, the global nickel market was valued at around $37 billion and is expected to grow to $73 billion by 2032.

Notably, Canada faces a growing challenge to capture its share of a booming $65 billion critical minerals market. A new report warns that Canada risks losing up to $100 billion in investment by 2030 without faster permitting and better coordination. 

https://preview.redd.it/mzffhkkp41gf1.jpg?width=1009&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1f88dca5ddbaaef2aeeafa205e7dea19b0bc4e34

This matters to Formation Metals (FOMO), as its Quebec and Ontario projects—gold, nickel, copper, zinc, and titanium—align directly with national priorities. With Canada targeting 60% of global potash and 14% of nickel supply, FOMO’s focus on domestic, multi-metal exploration positions it to benefit from policy improvements and rising clean-tech demand.

**Exploring a Diversified Portfolio Across Canada**

Formation Metals’ flagship asset is the N2 Gold Project, located in Québec’s Abitibi Greenstone Belt—one of the world’s most productive gold regions. The project spans 87 claims covering approximately 4,400 hectares and is accessible by road year-round. It holds a historical gold resource of about 870,000 ounces, with large parts of the property still underexplored. 

https://preview.redd.it/7fwp6jlt41gf1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=16dc67c038db0c220095377d985e02cf81ee8b87

Recent reviews of historic drill core samples have revealed copper and zinc mineralization, suggesting the project’s value could extend beyond gold. This is important as demand for base metals like copper continues to rise, driven by growth in the EV sector and renewable infrastructure.

In addition to the N2 project, Formation Metals owns the Nicobat Project in Ontario, which is focused on nickel, copper, and cobalt—metals that are essential for batteries and clean energy systems. The company is also advancing an early-stage titanium project in Québec, aimed at serving aerospace, defense, and high-tech industries. 

By exploring a range of metals, Formation Metals spreads risk and creates multiple pathways to market success. This strategy enables the company to benefit even when the price of one commodity fluctuates.

**Strong Jurisdictions and Responsible Development**

All of Formation Metals’ assets are in Canada. The country is known for its political stability, clear mining rules, and skilled workers. Québec and Ontario are top mining regions. They provide reliable infrastructure and clear permitting processes. These strengths help reduce project risk and improve the efficiency of development.

FOMO also prioritizes responsible exploration. The company works with local governments, municipalities, and Indigenous communities. This helps ensure their projects respect local interests and meet environmental standards. This commitment supports long-term success and reflects the expectations of today’s investors and regulators.

**Backed for Big Exploration in 2025**

As of mid-2025, Formation Metals maintains a strong financial position, with about C$2.8 million in working capital. It recently completed a private placement to fund continued exploration. 

The company is fully financed for a 20,000-metre drill program at the N2 Gold Project. The first phase, covering 5,000 metres, is already underway. This drill program focuses on expanding known gold zones and testing new areas for copper and zinc mineralization. Systematic exploration like this is essential for uncovering a project’s full resource potential.

**Riding the Wave of Clean Tech Demand**

The company’s multi-metal strategy fits well with current global market trends. In 2025, gold prices reached record highs above $3,400 per ounce, driven by economic uncertainty and strong central bank demand. 

https://preview.redd.it/wp1vdi4v41gf1.jpg?width=766&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d3bf7a2bbf53b10f7e0c49583d8a1b8e182a2ae

At the same time, copper demand is expected to grow by 30% by the mid-2020s. This rise is mainly driven by electric vehicle production and power grid upgrades. Nickel demand is also increasing as EV adoption grows and stainless steel production expands. The global market for nickel-based batteries alone could grow from USD 2.34 billion in 2025 to USD 2.82 billion by 2030.

**Key Market Highlights:**

* **Gold**: Prices above $3,400/oz in 2025, driven by investor demand.
* **Copper**: 30% demand growth forecast due to EVs and grid expansion.
* **Nickel**: Market value to nearly double from USD 37B (2024) to USD 73B (2032).
* **Battery-grade nickel**: Projected growth from USD 2.34B (2025) to USD 2.82B (2030).
* **Titanium and zinc**: Strong demand in aerospace and infrastructure.

By targeting both precious and base metals, Formation Metals can benefit from several market forces at once. This diversified approach allows the company to create shareholder value even if one metal’s price declines. It also aligns with national efforts to secure domestic supplies of essential minerals.

**Stability and Opportunity in Critical Minerals**

Looking ahead, Formation Metals is positioned for growth as it continues to develop its projects. With a fully funded exploration program, strong financial footing, and projects located in top mining jurisdictions, the company is advancing assets that are critical to the future of clean energy and high-tech industries.

As global demand for critical minerals continues to grow, companies with diversified portfolios and responsible development strategies are likely to play a major role. Formation Metals’ focus on gold, copper, zinc, nickel, and titanium gives it broad exposure to several high-demand sectors. 

Its multi-metal strategy and commitment to sustainable development offer both stability and upside potential for investors. Formation Metals is more than a gold explorer—it is helping to secure the resources needed for a cleaner, more sustainable future.
With copper and zinc in the mix, could N2 evolve beyond just a gold story?

1md4iz2,2025-07-30,"MVST Q2 earnings Boost
**Overview:** Microvast Holdings, Inc. specializes in battery technologies for electric vehicles and energy storage solutions, with a market cap of approximately $1.09 billion.

**Operations:** Microvast Holdings generates revenue primarily from its Batteries / Battery Systems segment, which accounts for $414.94 million.

**Market Cap:** $1.09B

Microvast Holdings, Inc. has recently been added to multiple Russell indexes, indicating increased visibility among investors. Despite a volatile share price, the company reported US$116.49 million in first-quarter sales for 2025 and turned profitable with a net income of US$61.79 million compared to a loss last year. However, it remains unprofitable over the long term with losses increasing at 0.6% annually over five years and maintains high debt levels relative to equity at 41.2%. With strong revenue growth projections between US$450 million and US$475 million for 2025, Microvast's financial position is bolstered by short-term assets exceeding liabilities but faces challenges in sustaining cash runway if free cash flow continues decreasing.



  
Q2 earnings 7 August, This could easy go from 3.25$ back to 4,6$ or even 5$

Could be a easy penny flips IF earnings are beat again.
Microvast has been very good to me. Might be the least talked about stock on here. Been accumulating MVST the last few months

Earnings reports and pre earnings have consistently been extremely good for MVST https://preview.redd.it/78p1aamc50gf1.png?width=638&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ad0beee0db6e6693c5bcf9038ae2428d2922411

He's the man Last one was pretty cool, got this since january because of reddit, but i should had buy everything i could in april, 1,15$ to 4,6$ 

But this time i guess it's a easy 3,25-5$ next earnings will put us 2B+ cap which is about $6+ Hey add this to your DD, copied from some of my convos with people earlier ( I already bought calls for earnings):

Thinking about MVST heading into this Q2 earnings drop on August 8th.

The company's been on a tear with record revenue growth already showing in Q1 and they're sticking hard to their full-year guidance of $450-475 million for 2025, which is like 18-25% year-over-year pop. They've steadily been demonstrating beating earnings by wide margins.

Dark pool whales are apparently accumulating shares hinting at a Q2 revenue midpoint around $118 million or so, beating whispers, plus analysts are eyeing positive EPS by next year. 118 milly rev is on track for their full-year guidance.

For the short-squeeze angle, short interest is sitting at around 15-16% of the float with about 30 million shares shorted and days to cover pushing 3.5, so if earnings surprise to the upside and force some covering, the stock could spike hard.

Lithium prices were super low in Q2 2025, around $8,329 per ton for battery-grade stuff, so Microvast’s getting their materials dirt cheap while Europe’s EV market is popping off, up 34% for battery EVs. That’s a sweet setup for fatter margins, which could make their $118 million revenue target for Q2 look even better and drive a nice earnings beat.

Here's ACEA's Q2 report on EVs:[https://www.acea.auto/pc-registrations/new-car-registrations-1-9-in-h1-2025-battery-electric-15-6-market-share/](https://www.acea.auto/pc-registrations/new-car-registrations-1-9-in-h1-2025-battery-electric-15-6-market-share/)

The ACEA Q2 report on commercial EVs drops tomorrow, so if numbers are showing a similar trend, it's all but guaranteed to pop off with your girl giving you the lock jaw.

So all through out Q2 ending June 30th, Lithium was at record lows. Whatever they decide to sell at from now on with acquired materials will be at a profit, dead simple. They had a back log on top of strong commercial EV demand in Europe throughout the time period.

The biggest hurdles are infrastructure, and as a battery supplier with dense, fast charging SS batteries, I personally think this earnings is going to be a net positive, catalyzing a move higher in stock price as the market slowly wakes up to the reality.

1md4ihx,2025-07-30,"$GRAB - A stock to keep an eye on
The primary opportunity for Grab lies in its ability to aggregate demand across various services. Unlike Uber, whose core business is centered around mobility, Grab's largest segment is its food delivery service, which is complemented by a robust financial services division. This unique positioning allows Grab to evolve into a demand-driven platform, converting users of its food delivery or financial services into mobility users through bundled subscriptions, such as Grab Unlimited. Drivers are incentivized to join Grab not solely for commissions but because it is where demand is concentrated. This dynamic contrasts with Uber's strategy, which primarily leverages its extensive mobility user base to expand its food delivery business.
Grab is great. I lived in Southeast Asia for 5 years and used it for transport. Even hopping to neighbouring countries, using the app was seamless. What excites me is their expansion into supermarkets meaning actually owning them, instead of just delivering groceries from them. Grab is basically Uber + Uber Eats. [deleted]

Many Amazing patents (one very revolutionary) Patents in several countries! Inc Japan , USA ,Canada

Just signed a partnerships with Lucid(LCID)on the nasdaq!

And now meetings with governors and senators! Something big is in the works.

With the increasing demand for zero emission vehicles and the need to create a circular economy, the battery recycling industry is inevitably set to see new and prosperous growth opportunities.And with lithium coming up off a multi year price slide there’s not better time to get cheap cheap shares!

For those that don’t know. Recyclico Battery materials has a patent in which they can complete the whole circular process making an old battery’s into new material on a molecular level that is ready to be made into a new battery! With second to none recycling process for lithium ion battery’s. The efficiency is remarkable with a 99% return on metals (3rd party tested) patent for a closed-loop hydrometallurgical process.

NO-ONE ELSE DOES THIS. All Competition gets the black mass and sends its away for the processes for cathode material on a molecular level.

It’s about time This tech is turning heads!
Yeah that’s what I’m thinking. Their tech is just too good to not become mainstream. Once they implement it and start generating revenue I can see this expanding FAST 

The risk to reward here is unparalleled

As part of the collaboration's launch, Mr. Sadowsky will join fellow MINAC members for a roundtable and event on July 23, 2025, in Washington, D.C. alongside Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs, Alaska Senator Dan Sullivan, and Representatives Begich (AK) and Biggs (AZ).

1mcexn8,2025-07-29,"“Two Key Points in GAMB’s Share Price Decline: Marketing Uncertainty and the Impact of the BBB Act”
https://preview.redd.it/c6f1vqgd3uff1.png?width=1041&format=png&auto=webp&s=600b407cbc20af3706991a8f489bac976a1eaccb

https://preview.redd.it/o5y2508i3uff1.png?width=868&format=png&auto=webp&s=efb0a58e221a0b08e3fc43469beb9fb3b947a472

GAMB looks extremely attractive from a fundamentals‑driven, value‑investing perspective—and in reality, it is.

**First, a brief overview of** [**Gambling.com**](http://Gambling.com) **(GAMB).**  
The company’s core business model is affiliate marketing: it drives traffic (i.e., users) to online betting sites and earns revenue in return. This segment accounts for about 75 percent of total revenue. The remaining 25 percent comes from Odds Holdings, which GAMB acquired on January 1 of this year; Odds Holdings operates a subscription service that supports arbitrage bettors and charges a subscription fee. There are a few other minor revenue streams, but they’re negligible enough to skip.

I believe the company has many strengths and a bright outlook, but I’d like to explain why its share price has been in a persistent downtrend recently. I think most of these points will resonate with you. :)

**1. Uncertainty around growth in the marketing business**  
Recently, it appears that [Gambling.com](http://Gambling.com) didn’t respond adequately to Google’s 2025 SEO policy and algorithm changes, resulting in a drop in organic traffic to its domain. While there are some signs of recovery, this issue goes beyond a simple decline in new customers. After Google’s 2024 algorithm update, many online‑betting affiliate firms saw their revenues and margins shrink dramatically, and their share prices fell by an average of over 50 percent. At that time, GAMB’s traffic remained stable—an ideal opportunity to gain market share. Instead, investors worry that this isn’t just a one‑off event and that GAMB could lose market share going forward.

**2. Risk of a collapse in the legal arbitrage‑betting market under the “Big Beautiful Bill”**  
Personally, I see this as the more serious concern. Under the BBB Act, U.S. tax law will change in 2026 from taxing only net gambling profits to including 10 percent of gambling losses in taxable income. In other words, if you record $10,000 in profits and $10,000 in losses in a year, you’ll owe taxes on $10,000 of “phantom income.” Investors fear this could devastate the arbitrage‑betting market, which relies on exploiting sub‑1 percent odds differentials across thousands of trades. In a worst‑case scenario, rotating $10,000 through 1,000 trades (totaling $10 million), with $5 million in wins and $5 million in losses, would leave you liable for tax on $500,000 of phantom income. Some may argue such volume is unrealistic, but markets hate uncertainty. One could even imagine the full $80 million spent on the Odds Holdings acquisition being written off

**Conclusion**  
From a pure value standpoint, GAMB remains highly attractive. However, until these uncertainties are resolved, I personally think it’s wise to hold off on investing. Of course, if the share price were to drop another 10 percent or more, I’d be ready to buy aggressively

1mcemke,2025-07-29,"$PSTV The actual near future 10x-20x bagger with an FDA cleared 6B drug
$PSTV is sitting at **$0.52/share** with a tiny **$35M market cap**... but it has a monopoly-like asset in CNSide, an already FDA-cleared diagnostic targeting leptomeningeal metastases (brain/spine tumor spread). Total U.S. market size: **~$6 billion**.

This isn’t a “maybe someday” drug. CNSide is **approved**, fully acquired, and expected to **enter the commercial market in late 2025**. They’re targeting ramp-up and distribution in 2025–2026.

The best part? **There’s no real competition in this diagnostic space.**

Let’s break down how big this could be 

| Market Share | Revenue (Est.) | 4x Sales Valuation | Share Price (Est.) |
|--------------|----------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| 5%           | $300M          | $1.2B              | ~$18/share          |
| 10%          | $600M          | $2.4B              | ~$36/share          |
| 25%          | $1.5B          | $6.0B              | ~$90/share          |



Now compare that to today's reality:

- **Share price: $0.52**

- **Market cap: $35M**

- **No dilution risk (they just cancelled their $100M S-3!)**

- **No competition**

- **Commercial launch within ~6–14 months**

- **Only US market, worldwide would increase the total addressable market by much more.** 

The market is just sleeping on this one. Either they think it won’t launch, or they haven’t priced in revenue. But when CNSide starts printing even modest sales, rerating happens fast — especially with biotechs this small.

Not financial advice, but this has real upside potential if they execute. Target: $2–$5 pre-launch hype, and much higher if revs start hitting in 2026.

1mce5n1,2025-07-29,"Sarepta Therapeutics
I bought Sarepta Therapeutics, got good news yesterday from FDA and its so undervalued. Target price $150 per share

is sarepta therapeutics inc stock undervalued?Analyzing Sarepta Therapeutics Inc. (SRPT) stock for undervaluation presents a mixed picture.**Arguments for Undervaluation:**

* **Positive Revenue Growth:** Sarepta has demonstrated strong revenue growth, with a 1-year growth rate of 39.2% and a 5-year growth rate of 26.9%.
* **Low Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio:** The P/S ratio of 0.68 is significantly lower than the industry median of 10.07, suggesting potential undervaluation.
* **Potential Upside from Elevidys:** Recent FDA recommendation to lift the hold on Elevidys for ambulatory DMD patients could boost future revenue and potentially impact the stock price positively.
* **Analyst Sentiment:** Some analysts see significant upside potential, with an average one-year price target of $30.28, implying a 74.22% increase from the current trading price of $17.38. GuruFocus estimates a potential 1147.47% upside with a projected GF Value of $216.81. 

**Mixed Analyst Opinions:**

* **JPMorgan:** Upgraded Sarepta to Neutral with a $24 price target after the FDA recommended lifting the Elevidys hold.
* **Oppenheimer:** Upgraded Sarepta to Outperform with a $37 price target, viewing the FDA recommendation as positive for the company's future.
* **Bernstein:** Initiated coverage with a Market Perform rating and a $13 price target, expressing skepticism about Elevidys' future financial impact. 

**Conclusion:**Sarepta's stock valuation is complex. The company shows promise in revenue growth and potential from Elevidys, but it also faces significant financial and operational challenges, including profitability concerns and regulatory risks. Investors should carefully weigh these factors, along with mixed analyst opinions, when evaluating potential investment opportunities

1mc9bts,2025-07-29,"New SEC Filing : USAS - Americas Gold & Silver
**AMERICAS GOLD AND SILVER CORPORATION ANNOUNCES STRONG 54% QUARTERLY INCREASE IN Q2 2025 PRODUCTION RESULTS**

 

**TORONTO, ONTARIO** – July 29, 2025 – Americas Gold and Silver Corporation (the “Company” or “Americas”) (TSX:USA; NYSE American: USAS) is pleased to announce strong consolidated silver production of 689,000 ounces for the second quarter of 2025, an increase of 54% compared to 446,000 ounces produced in the first quarter of 2025.

 

Americas’ unaudited consolidated cash balance as at June 30, 2025 was US$61.7 million, an increase of US$52.9 million compared to March 31, 2025. The increased cash balance benefited from the receipt of the first tranche (US$50 million) of the previously announced US$100 million senior secured debt facility (“Term Loan Facility”) and the receipt of US$11.5 million from a non-brokered private placement which was a pre-condition to the Term Loan Facility (see Americas news releases dated June 3, 2025, and June 25, 2025). During the second quarter, the Company continued to deploy capital into its revitalization and growth plan in line with its budget.

 

Paul Andre Huet, Chairman and CEO Commented: “I am extremely pleased with our very strong second quarter results which were a 54% improvement on the first quarter of this year. After spending significant effort underground at Galena conducting numerous time studies, engineering work, productivity-focused projects and implementing both new equipment and adjusting the mining method, our operation in Idaho delivered a 34% quarter-over-quarter increase – a tremendous result by the team. At Cosalá, outstanding efforts by our operating team delivered a 103% improvement on the first quarter as the operation progresses on schedule towards the transition into EC120 later this year. Overall, we are delighted with the results across our operations after just two quarters at the helm with the new combined team working very well together.

 

The strong second quarter production and our significantly bolstered balance sheet have set us up with the resources we need to continue executing on the initial phases of our operational strategy focused on unlocking the massive potential of our asset base for our shareholders.

 

Overall, our operational performance in the first half of 2025 puts us in a very favourable position with respect to achieving our goals for 2025 as we build our growth momentum. We look forward to providing further updates as we continue our 2025 development and drill programs.

 

**About Americas Gold and Silver Corporation**

 

[Americas Gold & Silver is a growing precious metals mining company with multiple assets in North America. In December 2024, Americas increased its ownership in the Galena Complex (Idaho, USA) from 60% to 100% in a transaction with Eric Sprott, solidifying its position as a silver-focused producer. Americas also owns and operates the Cosalá Operations in Sinaloa, Mexico. Eric Sprott is the Company’s largest shareholder, holding an approximate 20% interest. Americas has a proven and experienced management team led by Paul Huet, is fully funded to execute its growth plans, and focused on becoming one of the top North American silver plays, with an objective of over 80% of its revenue to be generated from silver by the end of 2025.]()

1mc6z9q,2025-07-29,"Q2 Results + MAKE90: The 2 big catalysts for SeaStar Medical are approaching
I've done these write-ups before and it feels like a nice moment to do so again. With this, see below for a breakdown of what I (and many others) see as the two major upcoming catalysts for $ICU. Please do share your thoughts as well :-)

**Q2 Earnings (Expected mid-August)**  
Q1 revenue came in at $293k, up significantly from $68k in Q4 2024. All existing hospitals reordered, and one new hospital placed its first order during Q1. Since then, SeaStar has added additional pediatric centers (including top-ranked ones like Texas Children’s) so revenue in Q2 should grow again.

Still, management warned during Q1 earning call that revenue will be “lumpy” at this early stage due to onboarding times and IRB approval processes. This call was almost precisely in the middle of Q2, so unfortunately doesn't raise too much trust in (significantly) improved sales for Q2. Some estimates point to $300k - $500k in Q2 revenue, but it logically depends on the pace of adoption. A strong Q2 could further validate the commercial story for QUELIMMUNE and create short-term upside, while a flat quarter could weigh on sentiment. My expectations for Q3 are significantly better, as ICU already added 2 major hospitals early in the quarter and are about to close (at least) two more.

**MAKE90 interim readout (expected end of Q3)**  
We’re getting close to the interim analysis for the NEUTRALIZE-AKI trial. My guess is that we're nearing 130 of 200 patients are enrolled at moment of writing and the 90-day follow-up should conclude in August. If the DSMB sees overwhelming efficacy they could recommend a halt to the trial. That would, logically, be massive. I am not expecting this to happen. If something sifnificant will happen, I think a shortened trial (to +- 150 patients for example) would be more realistic - happy to be wrong here.

This is rare in biotech but not unheard of. SeaStar themselves have said the trial population is tightly selected for those most likely to benefit, and they remain confident that the SCD therapy can meaningfully improve MAKE90 outcomes.

If I'm not mistaken there are four possible outcomes:

1. **Trial Halted for Efficacy** \- Major upside and likely rerating of the stock. No doubt best possible scenario.
2. **Trial shortened** \- Still a big upside with positive effect on SP.
3. **Continue as Planned** \- Still good news, just a longer timeline to approval (compared to shortened / halt). Fairly confident that this will be the outcome.
4. **Negative Data** \- Worst-case scenario; likely destroys the investment case.

**Cash Position and Dilution Risk**  
SeaStar had 5.3M cash at end of Q1 and raised another $4M in July. Burn rate is 3.5M to 4M per quarter, so they should be okay through early 2026 (assuming no major setbacks). But if there's no halt, they’ll almost certainly need more funding before adult commercialisation. I'm also taking into account that we might get another offering the next weeks, as Seastar needs to stay compliant with the minimal equity rule. Cash / dilution is my only real worry of investing in ICU, but clearly not worrying enough as I've put a significant amount of my $$$ here. Currently at 22.5M shares outstanding (without warrants), I'm thinking we will be around 40M to 50M end of the day fully diluted.

**My Take**  
The next 4 to 8 weeks will be business critical. If Q2 revenue shows real traction AND the interim data is strong, the entire investment thesis changes. We go from a speculative small-cap burn story to a real player in critical care. I’m cautiously optimistic and have added shares recently, but I know this is a high-risk, high-reward setup.

What’s your view and current sentiment with ICU? No worries at all? Confident but not 100% convinced yet? Awaiting IA before jumping in? Would love to hear from bulls, bears, and everyone in between. Cheers!

*Disclaimer: I hold 25k shares with a 2.04 average.*
Probably sounding like the biggest pumper, but if you read in well (or follow the Seastar Medical sub) it's not even unrealistic - I'm looking for high double digits at least, if not triple diggets. If the halt comes in about 1.5 months time, the TAM is about 4B. With <30M shares outstanding... I'm not even kidding when I say triple digits. Of course DYOR, but with the product being actively sold (and expanded customers with top 10 hospitals) and the amount of recognition they get from FDA, DoD and more... It's such a no brainer to take the gamble. Goodluck!

1mbvpc7,2025-07-28,"$TNFA: Potential short squeeze and it might go to $1.
Why I think TNFA will go to $1 in coming days?

Reasons: 

1. Novel Drug Platform
TNFA is developing Isomyosamine (MYMD‑1) — an oral TNF-α inhibitor aimed at chronic inflammation, muscle loss in aging, and weight-loss drug side effects (e.g. Ozempic-induced frailty). It’s a potentially safer, cheaper alternative to current injectable biologics.

2. Targeting Big Markets
	•	Sarcopenia (muscle loss), rheumatoid arthritis, and frailty are billion-dollar markets.
	•	New focus: GLP‑1 users (Wegovy/Ozempic) who are losing muscle with fat — a hot, fast-growing segment.

3. Early Clinical Success
Positive Phase 2 results in muscle loss and ongoing trials in fracture recovery. AI partnerships aim to cut trial costs and timelines.

4. Strategic Backing
Recent funding at a 20% premium and support from Prevail Partners to accelerate trials.

5. Tiny Market Cap, High Upside
At under $0.15, the stock trades near all-time lows — offering big upside if trials succeed.

Bottom Line:

TNFA is a high-risk, high-reward biotech play with exciting science and upside — but only for speculative investors who can stomach volatility.
50k shares and buying more tomorrow and holding for $1 so I don’t have to eat ballsack meat for dinner every night  No catalyst until March 2026 and the company has no income You better off holding your breath.

1mbtum8,2025-07-28,"🚨 Copper Is the New Oil – And $NEXM Is Sitting on a Freaking Goldmine 🚨
**📈 TL;DR**

While everyone else is hyper-focused on overpriced AI stocks, the real **next oil rush is in copper**, and NEXM is sitting on the motherlode.

Copper isn’t just another metal—it’s the **circulatory system of electrification, AI, and defense**. The world’s running dry, and when the market wakes up, supply shock = 🚀.

NEXM isn’t a “hope and pray” penny miner—it’s a **revival story** with everything lined up: high-grade resources, existing infrastructure, strong backers, and catalysts primed for 2025.

The world’s running headfirst into a **copper crisis**—and the suits on Wall Street are asleep at the wheel. Meanwhile, **NexMetals Mining (Nasdaq: NEXM)** is chilling in Botswana with two past-producing copper-nickel complexes, shafts ready, power on tap, and billions in untapped metal.

Here’s the play:

**Copper = Systemic Lifeblood of the Economy**

* Every **electric car**, **data center**, and **renewable energy project** needs copper like your lungs need oxygen.
* One EV = **100+ lbs of copper**, solar/wind = **tons of wiring**, AI data centers = copper highways for power.
* Governments are **stockpiling copper** like it’s wartime oil. No copper = no green energy transition.

And guess what? **You can’t just “replace” copper**. Aluminum? Worse conductivity. Alternatives? Years away.

**⛏️ Supply is FUBAR**

* Tariffs just sent copper screaming past $5.60/lb.
* Discoveries have **collapsed since 2010**, and new mines take **10+ years** to open.
* Most supply = politically shaky regions. One strike or coup = instant copper shockwave.

**💎 Why NEXM Could Send Faces to the Shadow Realm**

* **High-Grade Assets:** Selebi Complex + Selkirk Mine = **70M+ tonnes** of copper-nickel, with hits like **27m @ 5.9% CuEq** (absolute chad grades).
* **Already Permitted:** Shafts, power, water, rail—**production fast-tracked** while competitors are stuck in red tape.
* **Big Money Backing:** Frank Giustra (the Wheaton Precious Metals guy) and EdgePoint dumped $67M in.
* **U.S. Export-Import Bank** circling with a potential $150M deal.
* **Botswana = Safe Jurisdiction:** No coups, no nationalizations—just copper tendies.
* **Catalyst Grenades:** Hinge Zone drilling, metallurgy upgrades, and ore-sorting tech could **supercharge grades**.

🔑 **Watch $NEXM. Set alerts. Remember where you heard it when this rips.** 🦍💎🚀

$PSTV – Legit sleeper biotech w/ real near-term catalysts

Trading under $1 and flying under the radar. Just filed to WITHDRAW their S-3 offering – which means no dilution for now. That alone is rare in this market (IXHL anyone?). Here’s why I’m watching:

✔️ They specialize in targeted radiotherapeutics for rare, aggressive cancers – like glioblastoma (GBM) and leptomeningeal metastases (LM). Big unmet needs.

✔️ Lead candidate Rhenium-186 is in Phase 1/2 trials for multiple indications and has Orphan Drug + Fast Track designation.

✔️ Key upcoming catalyst: REYOBIQ (rhenium Re186 obisbemeda) - (ReSPECT-LM) Phase 1 data to be presented at SNO/ASCO on August 15, 2025. Phase 2 trial initiation planned.  3


✔️ Key upcoming catalyst 2 : CNSide - (FORESEE) Presentation due at SNO/ASCO CNS on August 14, 2025. Trial data reported that the trial achieved its primary endpoint, demonstrating that CNSide influenced treatment decisions in over 90% of cases, surpassing the 20% primary endpoint target, noted August 13, 2024. Additional trial data demonstrated enhanced sensitivity in detecting tumor cells (80%) vs. CSF cytology (29%) in patients with LM, noted November 22, 2024. 


✔️ Recently granted FDA Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for LM – this opens up eligibility for a priority review voucher, worth $$$ if granted.

✔️ Clean cap table for now – no recent dilution, and they pulled the S-3. Either they’re confident in data or another non-dilutive funding route is coming.

✔️ Plus Therapeutics has restructured its $15 million equity financing to eliminate potential dilution of up to 1.5 billion shares.


✔️ Market cap is under $35M. One good PR and this thing could fly, like we’ve seen happen with other sub-$1 biotechs recently.



Target: 1.8–4$  short-term if data is clean.
It'll be a worry if they release the news with no partnership or buyout.
Makes zero sense to cancel dilution without backup plan I got a voting email for a 1 for 250 reverse split, are we not worried about that? ![gif](giphy|1mzUamtQPTJW8)

PSTV!!!!! PSTV caught my attention back in July and I concluded its worth the risk.  At the time I purchased, it was around $.30 per share.  The most likely risk if the bottom drops out, it would settle around the 52-week low of $.16 per share.  So call it a 50% loss risk.  Regarding the potential upside, we could see $10 per share within 12 months.  A minority of analysts set a target even higher.  I'm taking the gamble.  The 2000%+ upside is too plausible to ignore. I'm genuinely worried by how much cash they burn. Annual net loss \~$27M, with Q1 2025 alone at $17M Sometimes you just got that good feeling. 🚀 Been watching this stock, you're right that's strange af, why did they withdrawed the shelf offering if they have negative cash flows every quarter and 0 revenue. Maybe confidence in the future of the company? Buyout or partnership? It's really suspicious, I'm in.

1mbj328,2025-07-28,"LPSN - from Frigerifico
Upcoming earnings could be the moment the market wakes up and LPSN bites back.

Sam Altman just gave everyone a preview of the AI jobs apocalypse and accidentally handed LivePerson a neon sign saying “Undervalued Opportunity Here.” Speaking at the Federal Reserve, the OpenAI CEO warned that customer support roles are the most vulnerable to extinction from generative AI.

His words?

“It does not make mistakes. It’s very quick… You call once, the thing just happens. It’s done.” Sound familiar?

That’s literally LivePerson’s product. And it's not theoretical: it's deployed, proven, and integrated into the operations of major banks, insurers, and healthcare providers. It handles regulated data and offers human-in-the-loop controls. It's not just an LLM in a trench coat as many AIs seem to be, instead it’s a mature, enterprise-grade, plug-and-play AI solution.

Now compare that with SoundHound ($SOUN):

Market cap: $4.7B 2025 revenue guidance: $157M–$177M YoY growth: 150% Gross margin: 51% Net income last 4 years: >-$640M total 33% short interest No profits. No path to profits.

Then look at LivePerson ($LPSN): Market cap: ~$100M Revenue guidance for 2025: $230-240M (thanks for edit Ravi) On track to be profitable in Q1 2026 Enterprise-ready tech stack in regulated markets Clear cost-reduction trajectory via cloud migration Revamped pricing raising avg. revenue per customer

Valuation is 47x lower than SOUN, with better fundamentals and a more mature product. Let that sink in. SOUN loses more money, makes less revenue, and is more shorted… yet trades like it's the second coming of Google Voice.

So what’s happening with LivePerson now?

Turnarounds take time. Earnings are lagging indicators. But forward momentum is everything. Here’s what to watch for in upcoming earnings (expected early August):

Last quarter of YoY revenue contraction. If they hit ~$58M this quarter and next, they'll hit the low end of full-year guidance. Hit ~$65M+ in either Q3/Q4? That’s above the top end. Revenue growth returns. Profitability is projected for Q1 2026… that’s months away, not years.

New pricing models are increasing revenue per customer. Legacy loss-making deals are getting dumped, long term, this is a net positive.

Cloud migration is reducing capex needs. No more hosting infrastructure = faster, cheaper scaling. Sales team restructured. Some larger deals could be announced in this earnings, likely tied to that $15M gap between low and high end guidance.

Delisting risk evaporates if they stay above $1 for a few more sessions, that lifts a psychological and mechanical weight on the stock.

New board member recently added, another sign the activist investors aren’t here to babysit. They want performance.

Market expected to 10x, the conversational AI sector is projected to grow from $14B to $140B in 5–7 years. Even 1% of that pie is several times current revenue.

What’s the trade here?

The story is setting up like a spring:

Compressed valuation ✅ Recurring revenue ✅ Inflection point in growth trajectory ✅ Product validated by the exact AI trends Sam Altman says are coming ✅ Near-term catalyst (earnings) ✅ High short interest with high float shorting but not crowded ✅

This might be the last quarter it gets called a ""turnaround."" After that?

It’s a growth stock again. With AI tailwinds.

If the plan holds and the new management keeps delivering $1 per share could go down in hindsight as the dumbest price Wall Street ever offered for an AI infrastructure play.

As always: risk management matters. But sometimes, so does recognising value before the crowd does.

💬 Not financial advice just a trader connecting dots
Beeen in LPSN, don’t use LLMs to write this Do you think they will dilute shares this year? What’s their cash runway look like ?

Burn victims In a matter of seconds during the initial patient visit, DeepView predicts¹ if the wound will heal or not, with remarkable accuracy, and up to 7 days post-injury. The DeepView System's potential to provide this assessment immediately could significantly impact treatment decisions, potentially reducing unnecessary surgeries while ensuring timely interventions when needed.

It gives crucial Data when it is needed the most , live & guided by AI . Cuts down on time, money, resources spent , all the while boosting patient probability of recovery & healing. 

MDAI is also exploring other avenues , such as diagnosing Diabetic Foot Ulcers . I'm not too familiar with this segment, but this launches in 2026/2027.

8. HCWC posted on July 2nd - down 1% (long hold for patient apes)
9. CHRS posted on July 16th - up 18.8% (Christmas came early)

THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. I LITERALLY CANNOT SPELL ""FINANCIAL"" WITHOUT AUTOCORRECT.

# The Company (or Why I'm About to Lose My Wife's Boyfriend's Money)

Alright degenerates, gather 'round while I tell you about FutureFuel Corp (NYSE: FF), a company that makes biodiesel and some chemical stuff I don't understand. They're based in Missouri, which is already a red flag because nothing good comes from Missouri except cheap beer.

What they do:

* Chemicals (the good stuff that actually makes money)
* Biodiesel (the stuff that's currently losing money faster than me at a casino)

Management: Some dude named Roeland Polet took over as CEO in Jan 2024. This guy is actually legit - 35+ years running chemical companies at DSM, Valspar, and Celanese. He's not some MBA moron; he actually knows chemistry and is laser-focused on ditching the biodiesel BS for high-margin chemicals. Insiders own 41% of this dumpster fire, so at least they're eating their own cooking.

# The Numbers (Warning: May Cause Depression)

Listen up smooth brains, the financials are uglier than my portfolio after discovering options:

2024: Revenue down 34% to $243M. That's like losing a third of your Wendy's paycheck.

Q1 2025: HOLY MOTHER OF LOSSES. Revenue crashed 70% to $17.5M. They lost $17.6M. That's right, they literally set money on fire. Why? Because winter happened and apparently nobody at this company has heard of weather forecasts.

The Good(??):

* ZERO DEBT (even I have more debt than this company)
* $97M cash on hand (that's like 97 million McChickens)
* 🚨 HOLY SHIT THEY PAY DIVIDENDS 🚨 - 5.6% yield! That's right, this dumpster fire STILL PAYS YOU $0.24/share annually while losing money. That's like your wife's boyfriend giving you an allowance while banging your wife. ABSOLUTE CHAD MOVE.

# Current Price Action (Spoiler: It's Bad)

Trading at $4.28 as of July 25, 2025. Market cap \~$187M.

Here's the kicker - their enterprise value is only $87M because they have so much cash. That means the market thinks their actual business is worth less than a decent yacht.

P/E ratio is NEGATIVE because they lost money over the last 12 months. Trailing twelve-month P/E is about -28.5, which basically means ""don't use P/E here unless you like getting rugged."" Price to book is 0.95x, which means you're basically buying a dollar for 95 cents, assuming management doesn't light that dollar on fire (which they might).

# 🎯 THE DIVIDEND SITUATION (PAY ATTENTION YOU DEGENS) 🎯

Let me spell this out for you crayon eaters:

* Current Yield: 5.6% (That's $0.24 per share annually)
* They're STILL PAYING IT despite losing money
* Quarterly payments (every 3 months you get tendies)
* At $4.28/share, every 100 shares = $24/year = 6 McChickens per quarter

This is like finding a sugar daddy who's ugly but still gives you an allowance. Yeah they're not pretty, but that dividend hits different when everything else in your portfolio is red.

# The Bull Case (Copium Alert 🚨)

1. 💵 DIVIDEND PRINTER GO BRRR: 5.6% yield baby! While your growth stocks are down 50%, this bad boy is literally paying you to hold their bags. $0.24 per share annually. That's better than your savings account, your girlfriend's OF tips, and definitely better than the 0% yield on your GME shares.
2. New Chemical Capacity: They're building new chemical plants that should come online late summer 2025. Chemicals = good margins = tendies = MORE DIVIDENDS.
3. Government Welfare (45Z Tax Credit): The government might throw them some money through this new Clean Fuel Production Credit. They shut down biodiesel production because they're waiting to see how much Uncle Sam will pay them. Smart or retarded? You decide.
4. Cash Money: With $97M in cash and no debt, they could buy something that doesn't suck or just KEEP PAYING THAT SWEET DIVIDEND until the heat death of the universe.
5. Insider Buying: CEO and some director bought 10k shares each at \~$4. Either they know something or they want those dividends too.

# The Bear Case (Already Priced In, Don't Be a 🌈🐻)

1. They Make BIODIESEL: Yeah, in 2025 with EVs. But they're literally pivoting to chemicals RIGHT NOW. The biodiesel is just bonus money when 45Z hits.
2. Weather Broke Their Plant: One-time event that already happened. They fixed it and learned. Lightning doesn't strike twice (unless you're my portfolio).
3. Class Action Lawsuit: Some ambulance chasers crying about ""material weaknesses."" Stock dropped 8.6% when announced and recovered. ALREADY IN THE PRICE.
4. Revenue Down 70%: Because they CHOSE to idle production waiting for better margins. That's called discipline, not disaster.
5. Zero Analyst Coverage: Good. We get to buy before the suits figure it out and upgrade.

# The Verdict (Not Financial Advice, I'm Literally Eating Glue)

This is either: A) A deep value DIVIDEND play where you're getting PAID 5.6% to own $2.22 in cash per share plus a business for basically free B) A value trap that at least pays you while teaching you why cheap stocks are cheap

THE DIVIDEND IS REAL AND IT'S SPECTACULAR. While your tech stocks are giving you nothing but pain, this biodiesel boomer is dropping $0.24/share into your account like clockwork. That 5.6% yield is better than:

* Your savings account (0.5%)
* Treasury bonds (boring)
* Your wife's boyfriend's tips (inconsistent)
* That girl from Tinder who ""just needs gas money""

The pivot to chemicals could work if they don't accidentally blow up the new plant. The 45Z credit might save biodiesel if politicians don't change their minds (lol).

My Position: 69.69 shares because funny numbers

Price Target: $8+ when catalysts hit (87% upside), $2 if they keep screwing up (50% downside). Risk/reward is actually good if you're not a paper-handed baby.

Risk Level: Somewhere between ""responsible 5% position"" and ""second mortgage""

FINAL DISCLAIMER: This is not financial advice. I failed high school math twice. I think P/E ratio stands for ""Penis Envy ratio."" I once bought WISH at $30. My investment strategy is based on which ticker symbols look coolest. If you take financial advice from someone who can't spell ""dividend"" without spellcheck, you deserve to lose money.

Do your own DD. Or don't. I'm not your mom.

TLDR: Deep value chemical play disguised as dying biodiesel company. PAYS 5.6% DIVIDEND to wait for catalysts. Trading below book value with $97M cash. New chemical plant + 45Z credits + competent CEO = potential double. Lawsuit already priced in. GET PAID TO WAIT FOR THE MOON. Not financial advice, am literally a golden retriever with a Robinhood account who thinks this is the buy of 2025.
I have been following your posts.......and WINNING...nah for real tho. I am in for a couple hundred. Your track record is pretty solid. If I could recommend posting more often, also post only stocks that will moon. But make sure your posts are early enough so I can make a lot of money. 

I am a lazy POS, myself, so if I am honest, I don't even read most of your post. I don't even copy and paste it into ChatGPT. I just buy. Thanks Good company that currently struggling and a great value play. Don’t forget about their special dividends which they do occasionally and just chuck a bunch of money at their investors. Followed your advice about CHRS and it's working well (Please have good ER next week). Gonna give FF a try again. in at 300 shares @ 4.18 exactly, its not often you can find a company with good growth potential and a good dividend payment

1mafahn,2025-07-27,"$NVNI Oracle might acquire Nuvini? Here’s why I think so...
I have been researching Nuvini Group extensively, but there is one aspect I still cannot fully understand.

Oracle has agreed to provide Nuvini with access to its global infrastructure. This would allow Nuvini to distribute its innovative AI tools worldwide and generate revenue without pursuing additional mergers or acquisitions. At first glance, this sounds like an ideal scenario for any entrepreneur a truly remarkable story.

However, Oracle operates **101 public cloud regions** (data centers) across at least **26 countries**, and its 2024 revenue reached **$53 billion**. Oracle is fiercely competing with AWS, Microsoft, and Google. So why would it extend such a significant benefit to a small Brazilian mid-sized company like Nuvini?

As for the AI tools Nuvini emphasizes performance ultimately depends on infrastructure and hardware. The claim that these tools can generate revenue within 50 days is notable, but Oracle certainly has the capability to develop similar technologies itself.

Let’s look at the facts. In 2024, Nuvini’s annual revenue was **1,767 times smaller** than Oracle’s. Oracle generates what Nuvini earns in an entire year in just **4.96 hours** not even a full day. So what real significance does granting Oracle’s global network to a company of this scale have?

This made me reflect on past examples.

Nuvini’s CEO, **Pierre Schurmann**, previously created and sold [**Zeeks.com**](http://Zeeks.com) and also founded and managed the VC firm **Bossa Invest**. In other words, he is highly experienced in building companies and executing successful exits. He once stated:  
**“The goal after an acquisition is to grow the company and achieve an exit through an IPO.”**  
This clearly indicates Nuvini’s strategy: to grow its subsidiaries strategically and recover investor capital through IPOs. The three companies highlighted at **Nuvini AI Day** already hold significant market share in their respective sectors—making them strong candidates for public listings.

Further investigation shows that Oracle invested **$8 million** in an incubation center, which is said to support the three products selected at Nuvini AI Day. Typically, such incubation centers provide:

1. Startup development support
2. Office space and infrastructure
3. Mentorship
4. Networking and partnership opportunities
5. Assistance with fundraising
6. Technology experimentation and proof-of-concept (POC) testing

On the surface, this appears to be corporate support for startups. However, in many cases, incubation programs ultimately lead to **equity investments or acquisitions**. Oracle already operates in 26 countries and has a cloud region in Brazil. This suggests that Nuvini’s revenue or local market share is not, by itself, a major factor for Oracle.

Therefore, the current partnership could likely be a **precursor to equity investment or acquisition**. That said, Schurmann’s **Class FF shares**, which grant him significant control, might reduce the immediate appeal of an acquisition. Still, it’s difficult to believe Oracle would provide global network access without a deeper strategic interest.

Another interesting point: Nuvini’s CEO and CFO recently accepted compensation in **stock instead of cash**, and at a **discounted price**. This can be interpreted in two ways:

* A move to reinforce investor confidence
* Or a strategic bet on a future stock price increase

The terms of insider convertible notes are also noteworthy. When Oracle engaged with Nuvini’s subsidiary **Data Hub** about using OCI back in 2024, it’s unclear whether future investment discussions were included. However, in November 2024, insider investment through convertible notes occurred. These insiders faced unfavorable terms compared to other investors conversion at **$1.10** or **principal +5%**, versus external investors earning returns tied to **SELIC +10% interest**.

Furthermore, Oracle’s relationship with Nuvini did not start recently it dates back to **2021**. This suggests a long-term strategic approach rather than a sudden partnership.

This situation invites multiple interpretations:

* Is Oracle aiming to strengthen OCI adoption as part of a broader LATAM strategy with an eventual acquisition in mind?
* Is this simply a technology acquisition strategy through partnerships?
* Or is Oracle positioning itself as a strategic partner as Nuvini prepares for an IPO or spin-off to achieve an exit?

I look forward to diverse perspectives and deeper discussion on this.
[deleted] Oracle’s full support is an incredible advantage from Nuvini Group shareholders’ perspective, but from Oracle shareholders’ point of view, it’s hard to understand. As mentioned in the article, Nuvini’s annual revenue is less than what Oracle makes in just five hours. Allowing such a small company to leverage Oracle’s infrastructure might, perhaps, be a strategic move to lay the groundwork for future service migration. [deleted] They also have to get to $1 before October 13th. So if there's no partnership on the other hand, they'll struggle and possibly RS. I often set price targets on StocktOits, and my current target is **$1.40 by August 19**.  
However, please note that stock decisions should be based on individual judgment, so this is for reference only. There are risks even with discounted stocks.
And forecasts should be backed by your own reasoning. What do we think NVNI could climb to by end of July? And end of August? I’m new to this very interesting company - is it risky to buy it at 0,4799€ becous it was at 0,169€ not long ago

1ma4djn,2025-07-26,"$SPYR – Forgotten IoT Stock Trading at Millionths of a Penny
Not a pump. Just putting this on your radar.

SPYR ($SPYR) was a public company that pivoted into IoT by acquiring GeoTraq in 2022. They claimed to develop ultra-small tracking chips (Tracker-M, Sensor-M) designed for asset monitoring, supply chain, agriculture, etc.

But… the company went quiet. No updates in 2024–2025. Their old site now redirects, and shares have basically flatlined.

Here’s why it caught my attention:
	•	Trades at $0.000001 – yes, millionths of a penny
	•	Once traded above $1
	•	~300M–700M float, almost zero volume
	•	Potential meme setup: abandoned tech stock, zero liquidity, high upside if it comes back to life

I own 6,000 shares. Not financial advice. Just a lotto ticket at this point. But figured I’d share in case anyone wants to do a deeper dive or watchlist it for fun.

If this does anything, it’s likely driven by attention—not fundamentals.

DYOR. Be smart.
CEO’s profile on LinkedIn says the company was dissolved

https://preview.redd.it/4efyvsw95bff1.jpeg?width=1206&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5a7d0072499c545f630aa2b31d8a3a75d63468f5 That’s because the company was dissolved aka no longer exists. Op didn’t even do the bear minimum to advertise this stock. I am honestly blocking their account to eliminate any risk of them gaslighting me into something radioactive.  I’ll put 10 bucks in just to say fuck it lol Oh great! Lol that explains why everything is dark. Kinda funny that Coinbase bought their domain tho This feels more like buying a losing lottery ticket that has already been scratched… website weirdly redirects to coinbase and they haven’t filed anything in years.  Just appears they went belly up and didn’t bother to cancel the shares or tell anyone I can’t even find it 

Edit: (on any brokers) Lol I was just surprised to see this ticker mentioned at all! I traded it through fidelity a few years ago when the company was still actively doing things and active in the market

**""This relationship allows us to expand our business and incorporate tools that our companies wouldn't have been able to access as quickly on their own,"" Schurmann commented. He also stated that Oracle is already assisting with the technology migration of group companies, such as Onclick and Lead Lovers, to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), with a focus on cost reduction and** [**optimization.Oracle**](http://optimization.Oracle) **and Nuvini, a B2B SaaS acquisition company, have been expanding their strategic partnership with a focus on artificial intelligence and technological expansion. In an interview with** ***IT Inside*****, Pierre Schurmann, founder of Nuvini, and Guilherme Cavalcanti, senior sales director at Oracle, detailed the developments of this collaboration.This is huge news guys!!!!** 

**Vieira highlighted that Oracle has invested heavily in creating ecosystems, with a presence in hubs such as Cubo, Distrito, and Caldeira, as well as partnerships with companies like Meta and NVIDIA. He added that Nuvini is also expected to play an active role in the recently opened Oracle Innovation Center, which has invested R$40 million.**

**""We have a real expectation of placing Nuvini's solutions in our marketplace, expanding the presence of these companies not only in Brazil, but also in Latin America and the world,"" concluded the Oracle executive.**

During the conversation, Schurmann highlighted the importance of the flexibility offered by Oracle in enabling integration with different language models (LLMs), which is crucial for the diversity of solutions and markets served by the seven companies currently in Nuvini's portfolio. ""Oracle gives us the flexibility to choose and in which context to use each specific AI solution,"" he stated.

Guilherme Cavalcanti explained that the relationship between the two companies goes beyond the traditional client-supplier model. ""We serve technology companies as partners, focusing on knowledge, top-notch professionals, and joint go-to-market,"" he said. He also mentioned that the partnership resulted in the creation of *Nuvini AI Day*, an internal program in which multidisciplinary teams from the group's companies presented AI-based projects with the potential to become a product in just 50 days.

1mypo5y,2025-08-24,"Zerodha AMC issue
I have Zerodha account. I invested 2100 in that account. After few year I opened Groww account but I didn't use Groww account for investment. 

I am getting charges ₹87/quarter which is to much for me. I only invested 2100 in 5 years yes 5 years in that to I am in loss of ₹200 + I already paid 200+ AMC charge. This is AMC is to much.

I read some post in this subreddit this is happening because of my groww account because I have multiple demat account. 

So my question is If I delete my Groww account will this solve my Zerodha AMC problem because zerodha allow 4 lacs of investment for free if you 1 demat account. Or do I will some others challenges. 
Brother don't invest in stocks directly then ..just go for mutual funds . It has a free of cost app named ""coin"" 
that is linked to your dmat account [https://support.zerodha.com/category/account-opening/resident-individual/ri-online/articles/how-to-open-a-basic-service-demat-account-at-zerodha](https://support.zerodha.com/category/account-opening/resident-individual/ri-online/articles/how-to-open-a-basic-service-demat-account-at-zerodha)

Read this Invest such amount you don't need for 10 15 years ..and let it stay for that long .. it will surpass your expectations I'm sure .. 3 4 years is a very short time but it will atleast beat RD Groww doesn't charge any amc on ur account but zerodha charges that so closing the groww account is not gonna help in this (until you tell the zerodha support to convert your account in BSDA in which under 4 lakh investment no Amc charges, but for BSDA you only need to have single broker account in ur PAN), for future if you want to invest in long term then try investing in MF and if u don't wanna invest in MF then use platform that doesn't have amc like groww etc. 

Zerodha doesn't charge for delivery orders but they charge amc so for the long term it gonna hurt ur money more compared to groww. You can directly invest in any MF through AMC site or you can use coin or groww or bank MF service, but investing through AMC site is best and track them using MF Central Buy one flexicap, one midcap , one small cap mutual fund ..with low expense ratio ..and one either sbi gold fund / liquid fund .... Use the gold / liquid fund  redeem and avg other schemes when the market has significantly fallen .. ie 15 to 20 % loss

1my2nso,2025-08-23,"Confused about AMC charges on Groww & Zerodha – need advice
I started in Jan with the Groww app, but later I read somewhere that Groww has high brokerage charges. So, I switched to Zerodha.

I usually invest only ₹1000 per month.

I received the first quarter AMC charge of ₹88, and at first, I thought it was normal. But now I’ve received the second quarter AMC charge, and only then I realized something’s off.

I read that below ₹10 lakh there should be no AMC charges. So I raised a ticket asking why I’m still being charged. The reply said that I have two demat accounts.

Now I’m thinking of deleting one. So I wanted to ask you guys which one is better to use for lower brokerage and overall charges: Groww or Zerodha?
It is free only if you have 1 account. If you have more than one account then you will be charged brokerage. Write to zerodha customer support if it is indeed the only account you have. Yep, that’s the rule from SEBI. If you are not trading and plan on only investing 1000 a month , stick with groww. Switch to zerodha when the volume increases Groww is built on VC money & they eventually have to ipo within the next couple of years. Like every startup that hit the street they'll eventually start monetising heavily & pricing will increase

Zerodha on the other hand is held privately with limited VC investments & runs very efficiently (v lean team, limited mktg spends). 

Long term i suggest Zerodha will keep on providing better offerings. The thing with choosing your broker is that it's a very sticky business.

1my0f80,2025-08-23,"50% loss on Par Drugs, shifting business focus. Should I hold or sell? Seeking long-term advice.
Hey everyone,

I'm feeling pretty stuck with a significant loss in my portfolio and am hoping for some guidance from the community.

I invested in Par Drugs and Chemicals because I saw it as a major supplier to some of India's top pharma companies. I thought that kind of stable, foundational business was a solid bet for the long haul.

Now, I'm hearing whispers that the company is planning to shift its business focus. This news, combined with my current 50% loss, has me really worried.

My main questions are:

1. What's the outlook on this business shift? Is it a positive move that could lead to future growth, or is it a sign of trouble that will cause the stock to fall further?

2. Given the deep loss, is it worth holding on and hoping for a turnaround, or should I just accept the loss and move on?

3. Does anyone have any deeper insight into the company's plans or the potential impact on its long-term value?

Any thoughts or advice would be a huge help. I'm trying to figure out if my original investment thesis is still valid or if it's time to re-evaluate.
Not too sure about Shree Pushkar.

Alembic Pharma is a good long term hold. They are generally discussed in Pharma conversations especially in context of Gujarat. It is no Sun, Cipla or DRL but has strong potential and decent talent pool. For Pharma sector, I’d be looking at diversified revenue sources - EU, EMENA, Emerging Markets. Less US exposure. This holds regardless of tariff situation. The reason is that US FDA audits are hard to clear for Indian companies even tho India has the highest FDA compliant plants outside US. FDA is thoroughly corrupt and biased in audits, it is unbelievable. Once you fail audit in one plant, you are likely to fail in other plants within a span of 1-2 years.

To pass the audit again:
1. Hire external mock auditor, who conveniently happens to be ex-FDA employee.
2. Hire US Pharma Consulting to coach you on how to manufacture. Your products will only enter US markets under Consultants supervision - millions of $$ overhead.
3. Attempt US FDA audit again.

It will take you 2-3 years to get the license back.

Other regulatory bodies are easier to deal with compared to US FDA. FDA doesn’t easily allow India into high margin products i.e. products with 1-2 MFGs…they won’t let you have the pricing power. 


Regarding staffing companies, it is better to stay away from them. Decent margins, but extremely low switching cost for companies because it is a low-skill service with a gazillion such companies. Executive Staffing is a different ballgame altogether, and very few companies like Michael Page are trusted with such roles. They aren’t manufacturing anything that has a moat. They are mostly manufacturing low margin raw materials used in Generic Pharma. Generic Pharma in itself is quite a fragmented industry, their RMs are even more so.

If they are pivoting to high margin APIs then you should consider holding it. Otherwise, accept the loss and move on. 

I’d focus on OPM% to make my decision. If they have healthy margins, they can maintain their supplies without increasing price. Otherwise, if an incumbent decreases their price then most Pharma companies would pick that supplier for the products they are manufacturing. Is it more than 10pc of portfolio ?

1mx9b9o,2025-08-22,"Why I (& Retail traders like me) are not getting profitable in FnO market
I (29M) have been trading in FnO since past 1.5 years on and off and have incurred losses in lakhs. Here are my 2 cents why me and maybe young retail traders like me are not able to make profit.

**Mentality before coming to FnO -**

After working your A$\* off in real life you see something which gives you money within seconds, minutes ...the money which would require a lot of effort in real life but here you are getting it without any actual physical setup and efforts. Retails trader is just behind making lots of money within less time and with less capital.

**Psych/Mentality even after learning technicals, charts , strategies -**  
After suffering loss of about 40% of my salary in a single day I decided to get discipline and prepare a 20 days trade plan and do scalping with price action. I traded for 15 days, out of those 15 days I was profitable for 12 days and losses were for 3 days. But those 3 days of loss ate up all my profit which I made being disciplined and profitable in all those 12 days.

My psychological observation as a small trader -

* Many of us are winner in real lives or non-quitters and loosing in stock market hurts our ego .Therefore when we suffer a loss our ego triggers as to ""how can I loose?"" and we end up doing revenge trade to cover those losses, forget all our setup , techincals , dicsipline and just trade only to make more losses.
* When we make consistent profit for some days, the money gets inside our head and we start searching for the prices of expensive cars, luxurious vacations thinking that finally I have achieved it. Such psych doesnt accept the loss we make even in single trades and triggers revenge trade.
* Personal life traits such as 'Never give up attitude' , 'I am a genius' , ' I cannot loose', hurts us in FnO markets, because market takes all your attitude away.

Maybe 2 out of those 100 retail trader would make it to the real profitable game. Are these things just with OP or rest of the loss makers experience the same things ? Let me know what's stopping you from being a profitable trader in FnO ?!
The entire F&O system is rigged against retailers and suited for HNIs but nobody is ready to accept it !

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/IndianStockMarket) if you have any questions or concerns.* This is one of many.. Other like the learnings we take before entering into the market. Those need to be unlearned. for example RR concept.1:2, 1:3 is all nonsense. Actual RR is on charts. It is the level where you become uncomfortable and you exit. that can be anything. but sitting duck at price and waiting for 1:3 to come is suicide.. you are watching price is falling.. instead of exiting you are giving larger SL.. it's all nonsense. that is why most of the traders are losing.

Next is price action setups.. those are always hunted.. don't use them. If.....if your strategy is correct, the reason is you are buying the wrong expiry (Lack of Funds)

Otherwise you are buying prematurely before the perfect setup presents itself(me, I have no patience) Trading is net sum of 0 , meeaing if you are making profit some one is making loss . This kind of system always tend to reach equilibrium . Concisering in that stat you can say you have 50:50 chance of winning a trade you can adject this ratio by risk/reward but over all money in/ money out stays the same   (minus 3-5% vic which can be market trade gap or taxes ). Now concider how easy it is to manipulate FNO market. Every 10c traded in cash market more then 400c traded in FNO , so anyone with big money can easy move the market UP AND DOWN , with as less as 500c and make huge profit in FNO. You as a retail trader will mostly loose , unless you are extremely luckey for rest of your trading life . Sooner or later you will loose all the profit if you even make any . First reason you are in loss because most probably you are an Option Buyer.

Second Reason you are in loss because You don't know Swing and Momentum entries.

Third reason you are in loss because You don't have Option Buying Setup.

Fourth and most important reason is you don't take Stop Losses. Create sophisticated strategy first and then back test it against the spot if it is directional strategy. Without back testing it is just your luck n temporary moment that runs in your favour. One pattern or strategy can change your life completely. Dont loose hope but dont get in full without back testing. It is backbone of all the strategy-

1mxrif1,2025-08-23,"Need Help in moving from Upstox to Zerodha
Hello Team, 

As the title suggests, does anyone have a proper guide on how can move all my stocks and MF from Upstox (which is hell btw, started charging me Rs 300+GST for AMC out of the blue, and also charging me Rs 20 per trade like wtf) to zerodha, I know there is something called as Closure cum transfer, thinking to do that, but do I need to open an account with zerodha first to do that? Or will it be done automatically ? What happens with SIP, which has been ongoing within MF, will that also be transferred to Coin (zerodha) or do I need to do something else?  


Lastly, is Zerodha good? All I do is buy shares for long-term investing, and I don't mind paying Rs 300 per year if that's the only thing they are going to charge me. I am open to consider other options as well. I see many people suggesting Dhan. Does everyone have a good experience with them?  
considering

Thank you in advance.

1mwzl5j,2025-08-22,"NAM AMC is well placed to lead the Passive Investing Boom
by [Pai](https://pranavyad.substack.com/p/hdfc-amc-vs-nam-amc-simplified)

  
Having analysed the MF industry in my [previous](https://open.substack.com/pub/pranavyad/p/industry-analysis-asset-management?r=52byc6&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=false) blog, we dive one level deeper into the industry and compare the two biggest listed players in the industry - **HDFC Asset Management Company Ltd (**HDFC AMC) & **Nippon Life India Asset Management Ltd (**NAM India).



# Key Variable for Company Analysis - AUM growth:

Usually, 98-99% of revenue for AMCs comes from management fees which is basically AUM x Revenue Yield.

https://preview.redd.it/mcgr69eyrikf1.png?width=1244&format=png&auto=webp&s=110e16b5f63a1d609cce6d8dd9f8651993cdb67c

The Key variable to track for good returns from an AMC company therefore becomes **AUM** growth as yields are generally gonna decrease for most AMCs mainly due to telescoping pricing slabs for TER set by SEBI.

# Focusing on AUM Growth:

# Part 1- The Industry

The industry AUM has been growing at 19-20% CAGR for the last decade. The last 5 year CAGR (FY 20-FY25) has been 20.08%, inline with the longer trend. What’s interesting to note is the category growth.

https://preview.redd.it/8gocymk2sikf1.png?width=2180&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d6ae958afc1a515bf4ed31fa2adb0bdb4386610

1. Equity actually has been the outperformer growing at \~30% CAGR for the last 4-5 years, gaining share in the product mix, up from 42% in FY20 to 60% in FY25!
2. ETFs have also grown handsomely at a CAGR of 29.35% in the last 4 years.

This sets us up for a simple understanding of the industry. Not only has the industry grown handsomely at 20%, these 2 categories in particular are driving the surge growing at \~30% each.

# Part 2- NAM vs HDFC

We do have a clear winner in AUM growth. NAM AMC AUM has grown at a CAGR of 22% vs 18% for HDFC. While HDFC has grown slightly below the industry growth, NAM has outpaced the industry growth of roughly 19%.

Why has NAM AUM grown faster than HDFC in the last 4 years? NAM AMC in its Q1FY26 concall mentioned something very interesting and promising. It established itself as the “***Fastest Growing AMC in Top-10: Both on QoQ and YoY basis”.***

The answer is simple but also interesting from a future outlook perspective. It’s the ETF category.

* HDFC AMC is an equity heavy AMC having an equity oriented AUM mix of 67% as compared to industry’s 58%. HDFC AMC’s equity AUM growth has been 29.38% in the last 5 years, which is inline with the industry category growth

* NAM AMC has also grown it’s equity AUM at a decent CAGR of 26%. But the real kicker and the differentiator has been ETF AUM growth. NAM has grown at an astounding 42% CAGR, gaining market share in ETFs from 14% to 19%, thereby leading the charge in ETFs currently

# Part 3- What the future holds

# Industry Guidance

It’s a simple guide. Passives should takeover from equity soon and be the growth drivers for the industry. This is based on what has played out globally in more mature markets such as the US

# NAM vs HDFC guidance

The trend should continue for a while but some big changes may be on the horizon. NAM is leading the race in ETFs. Passive funds are the future and unless something changes, NAMs strategy of focusing on Passives and holding the early mover advantage has played out well. It should continue to do so and outpace HDFC’s growth rate, however new entrants with clear focus on passives are entering the competitive intensity will increase. It will indeed be interesting to see for how long NAM AMC can hold its advantage. And that should be the key tracker for the investor.

1mwh6c1,2025-08-21,"ICICI forced NRI to open DEMAT to
NRI here. I visited the Sharjah branch of ICICI Bank to convert my savings bank account to NRO account. 

The guy there was super cooperative. But there was one issue. He made me sign up for ICICI Securities demat. I refused it but he said that was a rule. Since I wanted to convert my account to NRO, I accepted it.

What happened next was even more interesting. I got a call from India from ICICI securities and the fellow asked me to buy some random ETF for about 1000/-.

Again, this was as per some random rule.

I bought a 1500/- worth of Nippon Hanseng ETF as that was a time when the Chinese market was down. 

I thought I should share for the knowledge of others as to how banks are trying to monetise every opportunity of customer interaction.
Should have asked him to give it in writing via his icici email address. He would have declined, because you could have complained against him based on that. And every bank tries to monetize every interaction/opportunity, its upto you as a consumer whether you want to push back or lie down for belly rubs My username is what I tell my RM when he tries to pitch me ULIPs. A similar thing happened to me with ICICI. Recently opened an account with them.

The executive who visited my home was super pushy about the demat account. When I declined, he started putting it across as if it was a mandatory rule by the company for all new salary accounts.

I knew this sounded shady and the guy was pretty much stupid at reading social cues I think.

I had my company call him to stop. Which he did. But, he delayed the process by a week and even clicked pics of my PAN and Aadhaar card on his personal phone without my permission.

Then a few days later he started messaging me and calling me to get a demat account or a credit card to help with his targets. He said I'll just have to send him the OTP to process the credit card. Which I never asked for. I declined and blocked him.

Looks like ICICI is getting desperate and pushing their people hard to grow the revenue at any cost. 

My advice would be to switch to SBI if you can. Their online banking if at oar with any other bank. That's why they brought 50k MAB. When even NRIs not comfortable in getting scammed a little, they lowered it to 15k... On the different context..

Imagine everyone reading your username aloud to you.. 

Coz that is the first instinct of every person seeing it, to read it aloud.. All the employees have targets & they have to meet them by hook or crook. There's no compulsion to open any account or take any insurance from bank to convert RI to NRO. SBI has the worst customer care service + most of the bank staff is very rude. Worst bank

1mw2oev,2025-08-21,"ITC Analysis
Compared to Nifty only three sectors are outperforming i.e. AUTO, METAL, FMCG respectively. In FMCG, I checked all stocks and found that ITC is underperforming in all of them. Price is still in sideways trend not confirming the trend.  
But if you can see the Green Bullish candle at the support makes our weapon to trade. As FMCG sector is rising, ITC falling below this candle low is quite impossible. New GST rates are going to be introduced in which cigarettes and tobacco products may get 40% GST as they are sin goods.   
Price is falling but after even this bad news it hasn't fallen significantly. Giving me conviction that this weapon candle's low is my Stop Loss.

I have kept all my entries at 397-395 lowering my SL. I am expecting a wick on the same level after which Price won't show these levels again.  
This is only for equity not suggesting to buy CEs or anything.

Only Auto, FMCG, Metal have Green candles and are above 50EMA. To be honest We don't follow news only charts. So I seriously don't know what's the reason behind it. Can be because of the rare earth sector. Plus Russia also offering 5% discount on crude. So Oil & Energy may sky rocket too.

1mvmz79,2025-08-20,"The footwear industry in India is going through a pretty interesting phase right now, and a lot of it comes down to GST
Currently, footwear has a dual GST structure like anything below ₹1,000 is taxed at 12%, and anything above that is 18%. This hasn’t always been the case; until 2021, the sub-₹1,000 segment was taxed at just 5%. That hike to 12% hit volumes hard, especially because the vast majority of footwear in India (around 80–85%) is sold under the ₹1,000 price point.

Now the government is talking about slabs that could be rationalized to just 5%. If footwear under ₹1,000 goes back to 5%, it would be a major rollback that directly benefits the middle class and mass-market consumers who’ve been most price-sensitive post-COVID. For an industry that’s still recovering, that tax cut could translate into a meaningful revival of demand.

If parity is restored, it would be a big win for consumers.

You think? Manufacturers will simply raise prices to offset the reduction in GST so that there will be no change in the selling price. When a country has slowdown in sales of Chappals and 500rs shoes and Crocs, Metro, Woodland, Nike etc register higher than ever before sales, you know the country is pretty fucked and there's more at play than just GST! That's why the government is re-invoking the anti- profiteering rules under GST 2.0 for next 2 years. Under Anti proftiteering provision the business should reduce MRP in line with reduced GST slab.

With this in place, we can take note of the goods price and report to the concerned department if we doubt a business is trying to profit from this situation.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.business-standard.com/amp/economy/news/govt-likely-to-revive-anti-profiteering-provisions-under-gst-2-0-125081901485_1.html Why would they raise price if they are suffering with low sales due to increased prices? If sales will eventually pick up why is everyone as an investor so worried right now? 


Also GST has anti-profiteering provisions which makes it compulsory to pass on the benefit of reduction of GST rates to the consumer. Unregulated market is better than the ones where this industry stocks are listed! There are sectors like eyewear, footwear which are not for long term but strategic investment purpose only and gone are days where people believed that one should invest in stocks and forget about it Well if the second part is true, then obviously they don't have a choice. Which shoes are under 1k, they should increase slab to 5k Income inequality?

1mugstx,2025-08-19,"My take on whether Rapido will disrupt Swiggy / Zomato in food delivery
**TL;DR : It won't. Here's why.**

The news is full of ominous predictions about how Rapido is going to disrupt status quo and eat into Swiggy’s and Zomato’s food delivery market share, how it has partnered with the National Restaurant Association of India which has been searching for a messiah for a while now, and how it will offer what is clearly superior value to both restaurants and customers by not charging anyone anything except the price of food.

There is no denying Rapido’s central customer thesis has merit - if the bulk of S/Z’s orders are concentrated at a few restaurants like mine are, it makes perfect sense to create a niche by giving customers better pricing on this limited set of restaurants.

That said, **there are significant execution challenges, and food delivery is not the blue ocean it was 10 years ago**. I thought I’d record some of the reasons I do not feel too threatened by this development, let’s see if this ages well.

* Rapido plans to charge Rs. 30 for every order below 100 and Rs. 25 for every order above 100 in a 4km radius. A <1 km bike ride on Rapido costs \~Rs 40 now. One of Swiggy's delivery partner orgs says they make about Rs 44 per delivery. **I am skeptical of Rapido's  ability to sustain lower rates in the long term**.
* Food delivery has two major demand spikes each day. Swiggy and Zomato have had to supplement their delivery fleet with third party logistics during these peaks in order to keep customers serviced, happy and retained. **Rapido will have to either radically solve for servicing peak demand, choose to lose orders during peaks which will hurt platform credibility, or resort to the same fleet augmentation that the others engage in which will increase their costs.**
* Are restaurants really hurting financially? The difference between dine-in and order-in prices is primarily to cover S/Z’s commissions, and **I doubt restaurants are losing money** unless they consider the opportunity loss of what people actually pay online for their food. Enforcement of “same price as dine-in” will be punitive and post-facto as there are no inherent reasons restaurants will have to abide by this rule even with zero commissions - at least till the time Rapido becomes a significant contributor to a restaurant’s orders and defying them becomes expensive.
* Food delivery expansion will have to happen one city at a time, even with NRAI providing a springboard of restaurants which have already bought in. **Swiggy and Zomato will see them coming from a mile away and defend their turf** by making it expensive for Rapido to steal their business (think discounts, marketing spends, maybe even arm twisting restaurants a bit) . CM1 might suffer for a few quarters but loss will be limited to the geographies where Rapido operates, and Rapido will have to burn more cash than the incumbents.
* With all the spiel about building for Bharat, is Rapido trying to attract a different clientele? If all its partners are required to have four meal options at Rs 150 or lesser, it pretty much rules out a lot of premium / fine-dine restaurants. **If Rapido succeeds in opening up a new demographic, everyone benefits.**
* Even with its considerable installed base, Rapido will have medium to high CAC for it’s food business - especially if they start with an unbundled independent app.
* My read of Rapido is that they have SaaS org-ish mental makeup and focus their efforts towards building systems that run with a lean org. **Rapid expansion and hyperlocal growth requires large org building which is a significant departure from their culture thus far.**

Let’s see where we are in a few quarters from now.
I remember when grasim was about to launch birla opus paints, people said they wont make any dent to asian paints market share or their margins but opus made a huge splash in the market, because if it was going to be anyone it most likely was going to be grasim.
Here too if its going too be anyone its going to be rapido.
There is more than enough room for a 3rd big player and rapido already has some pieces of puzzle too work with. As for managing peak demand, well thats just a high class problem.


On zomato and swiggy stocks, from where they are they just need an excuse to fall. Solid analysis, kakaktakta.  I log this kind of market prediction in my journal to track accuracy.  Think Rapido can really crack peak demand? I am not investing in either Zomato or Swiggy but I sincerely believe that Rapido will eat into their market share.

Why ? 

Because now restaurants will have complete control over the order process and be able to save commissions. 

Let’s take an example of a full - service restaurant. They were paying 30%+ to Zomato / Swiggy till date. 
But the platform brought them the customers and they were forced to bite additional discounts to keep that business going. 
The total discount is now closer to 40%+. 

Add on GST to this. 

(& Zomato / Swiggy charges platform fees from customers , which will eventually creep up to “handle demand”. & Zomato atleast compels restaurant partners to buy wholesale from them or eventually will.)

This makes it cost prohibitive for both restaurants & customers , unless you are a cloud kitchen. 

With Rapido, the restaurant pays far lower commissions on one side, on the other the customer gets a flat pricing and no platform fees or packaging charges nor the need to subscribe. 

Eventually both of them will morph into something else , a la Ola. Rapido is still experimenting and their delivery charges or business model will evolve with time. Developing and maintaining a food delivery platform is cheaper than what it is in 2015. Rapido need not put efforts into building restaurant inventory or create food ordering habits to customers as these are already solved. There is lot of surplus (30-40% commissions from restaurants is huge) and Rapido can play around with commissions, platform fees and delivery charges. Not expecting them to dominate food delivery market but will certainly be one of the top 2 players. At least we will get a temporary relief from never ending squeeze by current duopoly. Established restaurants don't offer discounts on Swiggy/ Zomato - it's mostly done by newer restaurants on the platform. 


And one of my arguments is that restaurants are actually *not* losing money on Swiggy, their inflated prices cover platform commissions.


As far as the customer is concerned all they have to do is make Rapido burn out by offering competitive discounts over a short period of time. 


Sure I understand how you want something as a customer, but marker dynamics may play out differently. ONDC didn't have control over end to end customer experience and was not implemented in the right way. Demand is generated by one app, supply is managed by another and delivery by others. With these many players and not well defined hand-off, there are many deliveries that are delayed. Customer support for issues is not as seamless as Swiggy/Zomato, it takes forever on email communication. Just check how Rapido impacted Uber/Ola's business and their business (commission) models. That was a different time. Everyone was burning money and the only thing that mattered was growth, more users, more restaurants more everything. Industry is more mature now. Only few survive initialy. Happens with all sectors be it airline or internet companies from the late 90s(cisco came out on top in networking but that didnt stop mallanox from rising as a big player). Now that zomato and swiggy are listed they cant be too aggresive and out spend other players. Markets wont like that. Incumbents will lose the most because their business model is built on it, and Rapido is targeting it. Industries are disrupted in this way. A famous example is Blockbuster used to make revenue from cancellation fees. Netflix targeted the same and grew. Later pivoted to online streaming. They won't have to outspend Rapido pan-india, they will have to outspend Rapido in only a few geographies, just enough to cripple them. Also, the industry is anything but mature! Anyway, let's see how this conversation ages in 2/3 quarters. Your premise in all previous comments assumes an incumbent that is large, inefficient and less agile compared to the challenger. You quoted the example of Netflix vs Blockbuster, someone else quoted Asian Paints vs Birla Opus. This is not the same. Swiggy and Zomato are both seasoned street fighters and the rigidity and process heaviness hasn't set in. If Rapido brings in any business innovation it will be copied in a blink.",8,0.75,17,0,kakaktakta,IndianStockMarket,['GME'],take whether rapido disrupt swiggy zomato food delivery tldr wont heres news

1ms100j,2025-08-16,"EaseMyTrip Q1 Net Profit drop 99%, What's Your Take?
I just read that EaseMyTrip’s consolidated net profit crashed 99% YoY to just 44 lakh this quarter, compared to 33.9 crore last year. Their hotel packages segment grew 18% in revenue but reported an operating loss. They have made some new acquisitions & investments recently and the stock itself has fallen more than 40%.

with such drastic changes, what do you think is happening at EaseMyTrip? Do their expansion moves make sense given the numbers? 
Promoters are uninterested to run the company. Look at the promoter holding. They now have so many subsidiaries, it's diffcult to keep track what's happening. They have also stopped doing concalls. 

Every rise in the stock price will be an opportunity for promoter to sell their shares.

Better to stay away from such companies. This promoters of the firm are the Pitti brothers , who have used the secondary markets as a route to enrich themselves. 

Anyone working there is not only aware of the ‘Lala’ culture and the fact that the brothers , singularly , put Ashneer Grover (of erstwhile BharatPe) to shame. 

EaseMyTrip is our country’s WireCard. They like to ride on any “deshbhakti” wave, apart from that barely any differentiator from the competitors MMT has killed off competition from so many companies since 2001. Yes, even in the last con call Nishant was looking very anxious and unsure. You can't fool people long enough with fake nationalism Stay away, pitti brothers are fraud. Have other interests. One of the planned acquisitions announced last year is cancelled because another company realised there is no synergy with easemytrip. Also their announced acquisition doesn't make sense there are in a totally different domain. And all 3 pittis have their own primary interest other than easemytrip. See last 3 years results, consistency in decreased revenue. They just make random headlines nothing concrete going on. CBI and ED are behind nishant pitti and mark my word, I am surprised why SEBI hasn't booked him yet. He mentions a bulk deal for a 9 percent share transfer but only 4 percent was bought by the buyer and Nishant dumped around 14 percent at that time. He is the biggest asshole among all 3 They banned booking for Maldives . You know what, Easemytrip within a month silently started booking again.

Its called marketing gimmick, Not desh bhakti. Ask them to ban China bookings if they are dead serious. Didn't China supported Pakistan the most?

1mppt5i,2025-08-14,"Anyone Tried Multiple IPO Applications with the Same UPI?
Hey everyone,
I’m trying to clear up something before the next IPO. Let’s say I have 3 different Groww accounts, each registered under different PAN numbers (so technically for 3 different people).

If I apply for the same IPO from all 3 Groww accounts, can I use the same UPI ID (linked to my own bank account) for all of them? Will SEBI or the exchange system allow it, or is it risky in terms of rejection?

Also, instead of using Groww’s in-app UPI, is it perfectly fine to just use a Google Pay UPI handle for the IPO mandate? Anyone here actually doing this successfully?

Would love to hear from people who’ve tried this and know how allotment/mandates work in such cases.

1mojesy,2025-08-12,"IPO Application Rejections
IPO Application Rejections – Need Clarity on New SEBI Rules

I’ve been applying for IPOs for the past 2 years using multiple demat accounts (friends/family) to increase allotment chances. Each account applies only once for an IPO, but for payment blocking I always use my own personal UPI ID.

I was getting allotments normally (last successful one was HDB Financial). But after that, every IPO application started getting rejected—even in cases where retail had a 1/1 allotment ratio. Payment requests came and were accepted, but allotment status was always “Not Allotted.”

When I checked in Angel One, it said:

> ""No shares allotted as your application has been rejected by the registrar since you applied for 2 or more applications with the same PAN card, which is not allowed. Banks usually take 4-7 days to unblock your funds.""

This confused me because I’m not using the same PAN for multiple applications—only the same UPI ID. I contacted Zerodha and Angel, and both said SEBI now requires that all details (PAN, bank account, UPI, etc.) must belong to the same person as the demat account holder.

I couldn’t find much about this online. My question:

Is this a real SEBI rule or just broker misinformation?

If yes, why did I get allotments for 2 years with the same process but now suddenly rejections?


Has anyone faced this? Any official source or explanation would be helpful.
Which is NOT allowed

The buffoons on the app platform who could not get the minimum QC right🤦🏻 Use pan, demat, bank of same person otherwise it will be rejected. 

~ From a broking company employee This is not app specific. I get the same message with typo in Zerodha. It is probably coming from exchange. You need make payments from different UPI accounts.. until and unless you are applying from one PAN in two different categories. Upstox me allowed hai same UPI id usee use karo third party application ke liye Har baar allotment milta hai third party application se 😏 It’s for obvious. There should be only one application connected with the same pan that you’ve both in bank and demat. The application will be rejected else. You’ve to use their bank account only

Also, a single application using single demat account. Multiple application with your multiple demat account will also be rejected. I don't know about UPI, but when I apply using internet banking, it shows me a fixed PAN, which is the PAN attached to that bank account. I choose the applicant from already added applicants (currently only applying for my demat), so they both have the same PAN.

In your case, the applicant's PAN is different, and the bank account's PAN is different, so it must be the case.

Previously, they used to show only the applicant's PAN.

1mmrzm1,2025-08-10,"Swiggy & Zomato No Longer Offering Refunds or Real Support – Anyone Else Facing This?
Recently, I’ve noticed both Swiggy and Zomato have stopped offering proper support for wrong or incomplete orders. The in-app chat is useless now—they just redirect you to email, and you get an auto-reply saying no refund will be provided due to updated policies.

There’s no human support or investigation, and it feels like we’re forced to accept whatever the restaurant sends. Even after multiple follow-ups, they just send canned replies and close the issue without resolution.

Is anyone else facing this? Feels like customer support has completely collapsed on both platforms. Would love to hear your recent experiences.
They made us to edict to these apps and now they started executing their business model of sucking our blood I faced this last week. They didn't deliver my order , made a replacement order cancelled it and charged cancellation fee as well.
After multiple mails, they refused the refund.

Raised a grievance in consumer helpline and they refunded the money after a week.
It has gone worse. Do you have Swiggy and zomato premium? Cause u recently got the same issue and got refund as coupon it's useless cause there was like few days time to use it and I never did There needs to be a class-action lawsuit to get the government to intervene. No more AI chatbots. Support has to be real person. I usually do only CoD restaurants. If they delay, I cancel the order. Cost cutting. That is the point of building a monopoly or duopoly. If they cannot exploit you later what is the point?

And idiots will defend saying you should have read their “terms and conditions” which changes all the time. I am sure these terms and conditions idiots will be willing to become human centipad due to the terms and conditions. Also, Swiggy treats it's delivery partners like shit. > They made us to edict

Its not a nicotine like situation. Its very easy to break the chain....go old school and start shopping locally. Yes Agreed.

Facing this issue recently.

Ordered for an Masala Dosa, got a Dosa with out Aloo Masala. Raised a customer complaint, they denied refund and later on after multiple messages they accepted for re delivery , again the new masala dosa also did not have aloo. Was fully exhausted and did not raise any further complaint 

  
Incident 2 

Ordered Dark chocolate from Star bucks. I think they did not wash the hot chocolate container properly so there was coffee smell (i dont like coffee), they gave only 20% refund. I was furious, do they mean i have to adjust and drink the pathetic coffee or hot chocolate. 

later after several messages they gave full refund.

In this post, I have tried to compress my analysis into an essay, please let me know in case of any inputs/feedback.

On the eastern coast of India, in the port city of Paradeep, stands an industrial complex that has quietly played an outsized role in feeding the country’s farmlands for nearly four decades. From its genesis as a public sector undertaking in the 1980s to its present incarnation under private ownership, Paradeep Phosphates Ltd. (PPL) is a story of how scale, integration, and policy stability can converge into a long-term industrial asset.

# From Public Sector Roots to Private-Sector Agility

PPL’s origins were firmly within the ambit of the Government of India’s industrialization drive, aimed at securing domestic fertilizer production in a country heavily dependent on agriculture. For years, it ran as a state enterprise, manufacturing phosphatic fertilizers — primarily Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP) and NPK complexes — to meet the growing nutrient demands of Indian soils.

In 2002, a turning point arrived: the Government divested a majority stake to Zuari Maroc Phosphates Pvt. Ltd., a joint venture between the Adventz Group (India) and OCP Group (Morocco), the world’s largest phosphate exporter. This transaction brought more than just new ownership. It delivered something far more valuable in the fertilizer business — **assured raw material security**. OCP’s global phosphate mining and processing muscle, combined with Adventz’s domestic market network, meant Paradeep Phosphates now had the bones of a moat.

The transformation was not abrupt. Capacity expansions, operational efficiency drives, and product diversification happened in measured steps. By 2022, PPL would take another leap: acquiring the Goa fertilizer plant from Zuari Agro Chemicals, giving it a second coastal manufacturing base and access to western Indian markets. The company now had two strategically located plants, each feeding large consumption belts while minimizing inland freight costs.

**The Market Context: A Floor Under Demand**

Indian agriculture is an unglamorous constant in the country’s economic equation. Even as services and manufacturing gain share in GDP, the need for high and stable food production keeps nutrient demand resilient. While urea dominates nitrogen supply, policy over the last decade has sought to correct the imbalanced nutrient application that has degraded soil health in many regions. This means pushing farmers toward **balanced nutrition**, which in turn means greater use of P&K fertilizers — the very products Paradeep specializes in.

Add to this the slow but steady formalization of agri-input retail through the **Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samruddhi Kendras (PMKSKs)**, and the industry gains a more transparent, regulated last-mile network. Nano formulations — Nano Urea and Nano DAP — have entered the policy narrative too, but the rollout so far suggests coexistence rather than replacement of bulk products. Paradeep, notably, has already positioned itself with nano offerings to hedge against any structural shift in farmer adoption.

# Numbers That Whisper the Story

Between FY21 and FY24, PPL’s revenue rose from about ₹4,233 crore to over ₹8,500 crore, riding both volume gains and value per tonne improvements. This period saw global commodity volatility at historic levels, yet the company managed to navigate a dip in FY23 margins and return to double-digit EBITDA margins in FY24.

Return on equity and return on capital employed have generally stayed in the mid-to-high teens in normalized years. Debt levels have been manageable, with net debt to EBITDA trending toward sub-2x, aided by better subsidy collection cycles. The Goa plant acquisition, far from dragging resources, has integrated smoothly, adding to both volume and geographic reach.

These are not the fireworks of a high-growth tech stock. Instead, they are the steady beats of a business whose output is tied to the rhythm of the Indian crop cycle and the government’s resolve to keep farm inputs affordable.

# The Competitive Edge: Where the Moat Lies

In fertilizers, scale is not just about production capacity; it’s about **integration, sourcing, and market access**. PPL’s advantages include:

* **Raw material security** via OCP — reducing vulnerability to supply shocks.
* **Two-coast plant network** — lowering logistics costs and improving responsiveness to market demand.
* **Product diversification** — from standard DAP to complexes, TSP, and nano.
* **Backward integration projects** — ongoing sulphuric and phosphoric acid expansions to lock in margin gains.

The barriers to entry for a new player are formidable: securing raw material linkages, obtaining environmental and operational approvals for high-scale acid plants, and building a trusted dealer network under a policy-regulated price regime. This is not a market for disruptors without deep pockets and patient capital.

**The Policy Canvas: Stability with Subtle Currents**

The NBS regime has been a rare example of policy consistency in India’s subsidy-laden agriculture sector. PIB announcements over the last three years reveal a pattern: periodic rate revisions, budgetary top-ups in times of raw material stress, and targeted pushes for product diversification through nano fertilizers. The fact that the government absorbed global DAP cost spikes through a one-time extra subsidy — and then extended it — speaks volumes about its reluctance to let farmer prices rise sharply.

The single largest unknown over the next decade is the possibility of a **direct benefit transfer (DBT) to farmers** for fertilizers. Such a shift could change cash flow dynamics for manufacturers, at least during the transition. However, no implementation timetable exists today, and PPL’s integrated cost structure would give it more resilience than pure importers if it came to pass.

# The Reflexivity Loop in Action

Investor perception in commodity-linked businesses often swings more than the fundamentals. For Paradeep, the loop can work positively:

1. Good monsoon and stable crop prices improve farmer sentiment.
2. Faster dealer reordering reduces channel inventory and improves PPL’s cash cycle.
3. Management confidence rises, capital allocation to integration projects accelerates.
4. Lower costs feed back into stable margins, which markets interpret as structural improvement.
5. The stock rerates, lowering the cost of equity and allowing for further expansion.

The inverse loop — commodity spikes and subsidy delays leading to margin compression and market derating — is also possible, underscoring the need for vigilance.

# Risks and What to Watch

No long-term view is complete without risks. For PPL, the key watchpoints are:

* **Operational**: Extended plant outages or capex delays, especially the sulphuric acid expansion.
* **Regulatory**: Abrupt policy changes in NBS rates or DBT implementation without transition buffers.
* **Commodity**: Sharp, prolonged spikes in sulphur, ammonia, or phosphoric acid prices without timely subsidy adjustments.
* **Market Shift**: Nano adoption outpacing PPL’s own ramp-up.

Kill-switch indicators for the investment thesis would include multi-season margin compression without a clear policy fix, subsidy receivables consistently exceeding 180 days, or sustained market share loss in core products.

# The Price Point and the Long View

What makes this story interesting for a patient investor is not the prospect of overnight revaluation, but the confluence of:

* A business with deep structural moats in an industry where demand has a floor.
* A policy environment that, while not risk-free, has shown resilience and predictability.
* Capital allocation that has focused on integration rather than overreach.

1mlxrcz,2025-08-09,"Coal India Limited analysis
Hey guys I recently wrote a thesis for Coal India and would appreciate any feedback or your thoughts on it.

  
[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EWFQk1kwllFe4T2wFvS3fFLlPyNP0jcj/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EWFQk1kwllFe4T2wFvS3fFLlPyNP0jcj/view?usp=sharing) 
Here is the thing. Coal prices internationally are falling down a crater, and this means Coal India's margins are going to compress. In fact in the recent quarter, domestic coal was more expensive than imported coal (which is higher quality).

If coal prices do not recover globally, then e-Auction sales will not be a high margin avenue for sales and Indian companies would prefer imported coal, so Coal India will have to swallow a double whammy of lower volumes and eroding margins. All this to say, essentially Coal India looks like a commodity player, and if you want to invest in such companies you have to keep track of commodity cycles and time it properly.

Even the whole thesis of Coal India's massive capex push is actually a strategic misfire imo. A lot of countries pushed huge new coal projects seeing artificially high coal prices in 2022-2023, which led to global oversupply. We have to face the fact that all these new coal plants may be a burden if demand stays low. Even in the most recent concall, management said that there was not enough demand. Does your analysis basically mean it is good time to buy Coal India for long term ?

Btw Solid analysis (not a market veteran but depth of economics and data digging has been done good) That's lot of effort and that's the kind of posts we should encourage instead of memes. Thanks for sharing. Yeah, you raise a valid point that Coal India is exposed to commodity cycles and its difficult to ignore the recent softness in demand. However domestic coal demand is somewhat insulated compared to global trends. Also imported coal may be cheaper in the short term but supply chain costs, currency risk, and policy factors often tilt the balance back to domestic suppliers. And yes the capex push is risky, but if demand rebounds(as the projections in my thesis suggest) then Coal India will have the capacity advantage over private players. That said, yes you probably do need to watch the commodity cycle before you invest. I like the analysis, what is the source of this analysis and can i get more. Thank you, yeah I believe there is a 34% upside but hard to say when it will reach that level. I mentioned that they would be diversifying into that space so yeah I took that into account. Thank you! Yes I agree. The valuations are cheap enough to make these bets. But we should be cognizant of the risks.

1mlrfqj,2025-08-09,"New to Trading? Skip the Gurus, Lose Some Money, Learn for Real
Been trading & investing for 5 years now. Profitable in both not because of tips, courses, or some “secret strategy,” but because I learned the hard way.

If you’re new to F&O:

1. Read Zerodha Varsity for the basics.


2. Take ₹20,30k, start trading, and accept you’ll lose it. That loss will teach you more than any course ever will.



Biggest lesson? The consistency we chase isn’t in the market ,it’s in our own head. Accept losses. Don’t fight the market. Risk management > any strategy.
This is so true you can't learn swimming without getting yourself wet choose your pool size and jump. avoid trading and start investing... investing is safer option if you are new... once feel comfortable then slowly start with only one lot in a week with only one trade... That's how people lose lakhs, believing that they understand the market and hoping they will recover all their lose. But trust me don't do trading unless you have gained all the knowledge from trading books. I don't think Varsity will teach you much.
Otherwise get a trading circle learn from them there are plenty of people that can help on X like Ankur Patel,Umang(Stock Geeks),Nitin,etc. Follow these people's advices.
Why do you want to make same mistake others have already made and are sharing.
Better gain extra knowledge and then match it with practice.
All people think learn and apply but only very few make money. Was up 1 lakh yesterday, closed at just 7k. Still at peace because I expect nothing from the market. I just follow my rules. Profit or loss is only a byproduct. Well said. Similar journey. Identical lessons. Risk management and consistency are key. Index options only Respect your opinion ! I've lost 1L to greed this financial year is still going good let's see if with proper risk management i can make good profits.

hi. i'm new to trading, and want to open a demat (& trading) account. which one should i go with ? these are the ones that i'm interest in  : hdfc securities, kotak securities, zerodha.

if you have [personally] used any of these services, share your experience (functionality, hidden charges). i don't mind the amc, as long as they deliver good service


i'm leaning towards hdfc because, i have a sa with hdfc bank. if there are other better services, then do mention them.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/IndianStockMarket) if you have any questions or concerns.* Discount brokers are generally good, there is almost no need to go with full service brokers in this age.

Stick with Zerodha / Dhan etc. New. So Zerodha is fine.

If you get some knowledge, experience, account grows then you can think of full brokers. have you tried any of the full-service brokers ? You get these benefits from full service broker:


 Adding and withdrawing money is easy and you don’t have to wait till banking hours. They give you way more advanced tool to do research and analysis and the trading process is really smooth compared to discount brokers and as a beginner is less of a mess. 

I personally used Sharekhan 6-7 years back and it was too good. I personally liked the one tick data feature and used it for trading. 

The only drawbacks of the full service broker is the charges. This one factor is enough to choose discount broker over full service broker. if you could expand on the WHY, that would be great.. can you expand on the WHY ? what do you mean by charges ? are there any hidden charges ? what percentage (less) can i expect on a single trade ? what features do discount brokers don't have, that full-servce do ? Zerodha is simple. No confusion. Not overwhelming. Good customer care. The discount brokers charges you brokerage based on the number of trades. For example buying 100 shares and selling them will have same brokerage as buying 100000 shares and selling them. 

In case of full service broker it is based on the trade size, the more shares/amount transaction, the more brokerage you have to pay.

Regarding features as I already explained, it gives you a better and simplistic UI along with tools related to chart analysis. They also give you an RM(relationship manager) with whom you can consult and take advice/suggestions.

Most of the traders don’t need it as you can use other resources for your analysis like tradingview etc. and use only the broker to trade and not to analyse.",5,0.78,10,0,vijayin,IndianStockMarket,['AMC'],fullservice discount broker share experience hi im new trading want open demat trading account one go ones im interest hdfc securities kotak securities zerodha personally used services share experience functionality hidden charges dont mind amc long deliver good service im leaning towards hdfc sa hdfc bank better services mention general guidelines buysell oneliner portfolio review posts removed please refer faq asked questions_post_your_common common questions already answered join discord server using link 1 bot action performed automatically please contact moderators subredditmessagecomposetorindianstockmarket questions concerns discount brokers generally good almost need go full service brokers age stick zerodha dhan etc new zerodha fine get knowledge experience account grows think full brokers tried fullservice brokers get benefits full service broker adding withdrawing money easy dont wait till banking hours give way advanced tool research analysis trading process really smooth compared discount brokers beginner less mess personally used sharekhan 67 years back good personally liked one tick data feature used trading drawbacks full service broker charges one factor enough choose discount broker full service broker could expand would great expand mean charges hidden charges percentage less expect single trade features discount brokers dont fullservce zerodha simple confusion overwhelming good customer care discount brokers charges brokerage based number trades example buying 100 shares selling brokerage buying 100000 shares selling case full service broker based trade size sharesamount transaction brokerage pay regarding features already explained gives better simplistic ui along tools related chart analysis also give rmrelationship manager consult take advicesuggestions traders dont need use resources analysis like tradingview etc use broker trade analyse

Came across a Twitter post by Nithin Kamath, after which I did a little math and found that the same trade, across three segment, has three wildly different STT costs.

Taken a simple case

Stock : Reliance , Buy@ 1390 , sell @ 1400 , Qty 500 (1 lot in fno)

https://preview.redd.it/ytqyoate6qhf1.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=d04c96ce5cff5e5a29ba9a190918eac34bf7ecfc

Delivery STT is **8x** intraday STT.

STT was introduced in 2004 to replace the short-term capital gains tax.  
Now we pay **both STCG + STT**  isn’t that just **tax on tax**?

If SEBI actually wants more retail participation, lowering STT  should be the first step.

What do you think outdated relic or a necessary evil?
Absolutely.

STT was introduced since LTCG was exempt.

Now we have LTCG + increased STT.

So now we pay STT on every transaction; even loss making ones; in addition to a host of other government.

And then LTCG / STCG without indexation benefit if we are in profit.

This is tax terrorism at its finest. in the last 5/7 years

LTCG tax increased

STCG tax increased

Indexation benefits reduced

Debt mutual fund benefits closed

Dividend tax introduced

Gold tax increased

Since UPI is allowed does fund blocking work in OD accounts for ipo investing?

I have a very big gap between my income and my expenses so keeping funds idle in my salary account for whole month seems like a waste. But keeping liquidity at T+2 debt fund (with 0 in hand) is also hazardous as not everyone accept credit cards in india.

Hence, wanted to get best of both worlds. Immediate fund access with nominal interest for a few days, and non-taxable 6-8% gains (until realized).

My idea is to never withdraw. I have cashflow from other things (and primarily income), I want to keep it as collateral for as long as possible. Ideas btw? overdraft has charges.

Why do you have to keep your money in account?

just put it in the fund as soon as you get it, keeping maybe 10k for expenses. 

Use credit cards for your other expenses. Pay it off. next month before interest ipo investing.

2-10L on savings account is what i generally keep.

1mixddo,2025-08-06,"SBI Securities opened a Demat account without informing me? ₹588 deducted without consent
Hey everyone,
I recently turned 18 and opened a regular savings account at SBI. Yesterday,someone from the bank called and asked me to visit the branch. I assumed it was for some final formalities, so I didn’t question it much.

When I went there, the staff told me to download an app called SBI Securities and asked me to log in. Then they made me do some small trading activity. I didn’t question it at the time because I thought it was just another app like YONO – something that’s part of their internal process. I'm not into trading at the moment (don’t even have the funds for it), so I honestly didn’t think much about it.

Later that day(5 aug), I checked my transaction history and noticed ₹96 was deducted — which the bank staff had mentioned during the process, so that was fine.

But to my shock, I also saw a ₹588 deduction on 1st August under the name SBI Securities Cap. I had opened my savings account on 28th July,
I'm getting spam emails from sbi securities also from that day!

I did some digging and found out this was the Annual Maintenance Charge (AMC) for a Demat account, which was opened without my consent or knowledge. I was never informed that a trading or Demat account was being created, let alone that I’d be charged for it(yearly?)

Now I’m stuck. I’m not even trading currently, yet they opened an account in my name, made some initial trades on my behalf just to “activate” things, and deducted ₹588.

Even my father was confused when I explained what happened — and honestly, I feel dumb and taken advantage of. I trusted the staff, they seemed helpful, but now I’m wondering if this is some kind of routine upselling they’re doing to meet targets — without customer consent.

Is this a known issue? Has anyone else experienced this with SBI or other banks?
What should I do next?

Should I confront the branch in person?

Is it worth trying to pause the account instead of closing it entirely? I might want to trade in the future.

Can I get a refund for the ₹588 AMC?


I’d really appreciate some advice. Feeling quite frustrated and unsure of what steps to take. Thanks in advance.

Give a written complaint about that employee to the branch manager and get acknowledgement details about the complaint. This is such a dishonest move by SBI. You should raise a complaint against them. Nobody can open your demat account let alone deduct AMC without even informing you. You forgot to follow up after a month. Just complain to RBI and see them begging you to take the complaint back. I visit a SBI branch to deposit one time and they told to wait to get OTP, I asked why then they said it's for feedback for cash deposit, due to their stupid server I didn't get any OTP and there is a long queue, so I told them later will do this and left the branch and now I getting to know why they want otp... Then I started to deposit in CDM ATM machines only First complain online over call or email. Wait for the response. If you get a favourable response well and good. If you think you didn't receive any resolution. Raise the complaint with the RBI ombudsman after 30.days of initial complaints. See them coming behind you. I emailed the helpdesk, didn't received any good response then i talked to this sbi securities person whom i alloted to assist, he told me that this is the one time payment and all? Is that even true? He told me that you will never gonna be charged again?

And without consent thing, he told me to talk to the branch as he can't talk abt this!
Wht should i do? Go to the branch and confront them?

Or just raise the complaint directly? Cause literally they didn't even tell me anything abt thiss

I can't let them go that easily? Should i talk to the branch first directly or just for the complain? I knew that..

It's literally feels like a scam lol.. Okay thanks

1mhzjwq,2025-08-05,"Industry Analysis: Asset Management Company
By [Pai](https://pranavyad.substack.com/)

This post covers the Asset Management industry in India. It can be of **value for Equity Investors** looking to invest in AMC stocks and this report can be a first step into understanding what to look for in a good AMC

https://preview.redd.it/j3fhojrtm4hf1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3c9dbfda4a46e09788a2395580157118c0dc982b

# Industry Analysis - Lay of the Land

# 1. Industry Map & Profit Pool

* From the industry map of Capital Markets, some things become quite clear.
   * 1. The **major share of revenue and profit pools** in the capital market ecosystem is taken by AMCs.
      * This is good news as it means the land is not dry and is worthy of further exploration in order to find a good investing opportunity.
   * 2. **High ROCEs and OPMs**
      * further great signs for the industry when compared to other industries in the ecosystem. It is an **asset light** industry where major costs are employee costs while manufacturing costs are zero. That’s beautiful, as we are saved from the worry of raw material volatility. While employing low capital, these businesses can generate massive profits. It’s a beautiful business to own at the surface level.

# 2. A bit about AMCs

# How do AMCs make money?

* Companies charge a **fee** for managing funds called an expense ratio. In India, TER also contains distributor fees, but at least 50% flows down to the AMCs and we call this the yield for the fund. Indian AMCs garner yields of .4-.5% on average, higher than their global peers, major reason being low passive fund share as of now.

# Growth Story & Trends Observed (hindsight)

* The 10-year CAGR (FY15→FY25) in AUM has been **≈ 20.5 %**. That's an exceptional run-rate over such a time period. Except for the covid induced drop in 2020, growth has been more or less steady. It’s tough to see an inflection point in this journey since the industry has been growing around 20% cagr since 2005.
* **Categories Leading the Charge:** In the last 5 years, growth has been led by Equity and Passive funds, showing CAGRs of \~30% and \~36% respectively. These categories have been gaining more of the AUM pie at the expense of debt oriented schemes.

https://preview.redd.it/e559ctv4n4hf1.png?width=1294&format=png&auto=webp&s=e729a737c2cf03111a658766b37d246677144efd



* **SIP Inflows:** Inflows via SIP have been increasing at the rate of \~26% for the last 8 years, with SIP AUM reaching 20% of total AUM. The adoption of SIPs among retail investors has been a major reason for the growth of the industry.

https://preview.redd.it/oa0l8n17n4hf1.png?width=1442&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d25221ce125c86e8d5325a60bcd39e188966fcd



# 3. Market Share Analysis

* Instability & Concentration
   * Well, an asset light industry with great return ratios and profit margins does attract competition. The industry has at least 40 AMCs however the top **7-8 control 70-80%** of the market share. What’s interesting is this industry can further be studied in sub parts based on the asset they invest in - equity funds and debt funds are the major categories which can be further divided into active and passive funds. It’s important to understand the industry at this level because equity funds yields > debt fund yields and active fund yields > passive fund yields.
   * Indian AMCs yields are usually .4-.5% of AUM which showcases an important aspect of the industry. **Economies of scale** play a huge role as yields are miniscule. However these miniscule yields applied to massive funds under management yield handsome profits for the companies, \~50% of which are usually passed down to shareholders.

# Part 2: Industry Structure

# 1. Classification

https://preview.redd.it/lpu2o2tjn4hf1.png?width=1376&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a9bc7a2d315d0fe865b702929e2ff9f2385255f

* We classify AMC industry as **Growing**
   * due to the double digit growth seen in the last 20 years and the potential runway for more growth
   * Future Potential Runway

# 2. Five Forces Analysis (to understand drivers of profitability)

https://preview.redd.it/zpb12ovfn4hf1.png?width=1376&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd4c87315062570cbd0ddfaa10143119b473a4fb

* **Force 1: Threat of New Entrants**
   * Not anyone can go open up an AMC tomorrow. It is a capital intensive task which also takes regulatory approvals. With that said, as seen with the Jio-Blackrock JV, powerful players (strong sponsors) can and will want to enter this growing and lucrative business
   * Entry rates are roughly 1 per year while 75% survival rate is seen. Most exits happen via acquisitions rather than market failure.
   * **Barriers To Entry**
      * High level of Capital required, the strength of established brands and customer loyalty, access to distribution channels, economies of scale, the costs of switching from one supplier to another, and government regulations.
   * In a growing industry on the verge of some stability, it’s phase where entrants are being seen especially as other players in Capital Markets try to horizontally integrate into AMC business as well as powerhouses choosing to enter the industry.
   * Overall: **Moderate to High.** A powerful player which can perform well has the ability to disrupt the market share and force margin pressure as switching costs are low.
   * However medium term outlook remains higher as it’s a growing industry and new entrants are expected
   * Longer term, we will notice consolidation and powerful players taking a bigger chunk of the pie and probably a lower risk of new entrants.
   * What this means - AMCs either have to be nimble or stick to their guns and follow a long term strategy to survive this medium turn competitive intensity.
* **Force 2: Rivalry Among Existing Firms**
   * Weapons of rivalry include pricing, service offerings, new products, advertising, and promotional spending. There’s been a gradual decline in TER indicating MF trying to compete on pricing as the competition intensifies, however prominent reasons for this can also be regulatory changes and the general rise of passive funds. New products are on the rise and advertising has been a combined effort of the industry. All these factors indicate intense rivalry among the AMC as of this phase of industry growth.
   * Overall: **Moderate to High.** AMCs need to form their competitive strategies to avoid direct competition and try to capture niches.
* **Force 3: Bargaining Power of Suppliers**
   * Suppliers for AMCs can be RTAs, Custodians, Index Licensors. I would argue that even though some of the suppliers form duopolies, they don’t have much power to increase input costs for the AMCs.
   * Overall : **Low to Moderate**, not an area of concern for AMCs for now
* **Force 4: Bargaining Power of Buyers**
   * Buyers, especially the new direct-fintech ones, are aware of product offerings, have low switching costs (and in fact some are too short term), fragmented when it comes to retail, and are very performance oriented.
   * Overall - **Moderate to High**, trending upwards towards High as Buyer Knowledge keeps increasing. What this means is that it very important for AMCs to offer differentiated products and most importantly either have a good trusted brand image or a sustained performance track record (often the two go hand in hand)
* **Force 5: Threat of Substitutes**
   * Let’s first look at some of the substitutes available to the buyers. DIY stock investing, model portfolio, PMF/AIF, ULIPs, other investment category products like FD, Gold, Bitcoin (cryptos). I would argue that in the long term and overlooking temporary fads, mutual fund products will have a strong presence and although some buyers might pivot to high risk, more demanding products like DIY investing or cryptos, most will stick to Mutual Funds especially on realizations of market cycles and the drawdowns during break markets. The Low Volatility of Mutual Funds is a great feature for the busy individual who can’t devote a lot of time to wealth creation but still knows that he deserves more returns than offered by FDs.
   * Overall **Low to Moderate**. There are substitutes for certain segments of the buyer like HNIs & financial-literate, but mutual funds will keep a stronghold in the game. They might pivot to more passive nature and start offering alternate funds nonetheless as can be seen in more stable markets like the US

# 3. Disruption and Disintegration

https://preview.redd.it/izeubpmqn4hf1.png?width=1378&format=png&auto=webp&s=5242edb3edd368da0d53b2376bad2e120ea2edbf

>

* Disruptive Innovation
   * Innovations currently seen in the industry have been more **sustaining** than disruptive, offerings new and new versions of the product. Currently the industry doesn't seem to be tackling any disruptive innovation with GEN AI as well not seeming to impact the industry as such. More disruptions are being seen in the feeder industry of MF distributors where fintech platforms offering Direct DIY MF investing seem to be cutting MF distributors completely out of the game as fast as retail customers are concerned.

# Part 3: Summary & Future Outlook

**Summary** : An attractive industry in its growth phase has been attracting new players. Although we already see concentration such that the top 20% AMCs control 70-80% funds. Threat of new entrants are moderate/high and we’ve seen new entrants in terms of players doing horizontal integration and big players also entering the industry, although new offerings are more and more trending on the passive side.

**Outlook:** The future looks bright for the industry with still some runway left in the medium to long term. However, the future might consist of

* shrinking yields,
* the shift to passive funds,
* initial competitive intensity followed by consolidation via acquisitions and
* the ability of future winners to focus on niches, staying nimble but still focusing on their long term strategy rather than getting too caught up in the investment fad of the moment.

1mh9hpk,2025-08-04,"Yesterday's prediction turned 100% accurate - Self made AI for NSE (Need help)
Traders,

I'm a short seller and developer who spent several weeks and considerable resources building an app that aggregates data from 22 sources (including 6 paid APIs) to form market sentiment analysis by 8:45 AM, with a final check at 9:13 AM before market open.

**Purpose:**

The app aims to capture opportunities in the first 45 minutes of trading. Enter positions at market open and exit by 9:55 AM regardless of outcome. This window typically sees the strongest moves based on overnight news and pre-market information.

The strategy stems from my observation that 80% of early market movement responds to overnight US/global developments. As the Indian trading day progresses, local events influence direction, but the first 30-40 minutes often reflect pure overnight sentiment.

This approach doesn't require extensive historical data since positions are brief and primarily news-driven - what I call ""sentiment trading.""

**Recent Performance:**

After the weekend, my app flagged the same 4 stocks from 9 PM onwards, all showing no short signals: Reliance, TCS, Infosys, and L&T. All four gained significantly during my target window and continued through the session.

Am I claiming to have built a crystal ball? Absolutely not. Trading is about taking positions based on your analysis and accepting the inherent uncertainty. Success requires choosing a bias and committing to it.

**Seeking Input:**

No system achieves 100% accuracy. My target is 70-80% profitable trades within the specified timeframe. Currently, the app analyzes:

International: Policy changes, geopolitical events, war developments, oil prices, currency markets, US indices, commentary from leading economists and policymakers

Domestic: Company results, NIFTY50 CEO news, RBI policies, rate decisions, employment data

The system assigns sentiment scores ranging from ""Strongly Bullish"" to ""Strongly Bearish"" based on this aggregate data.

I'm looking for feedback from intraday traders who work with options or day trade stocks. What additional factors do you monitor when placing trades? What data points am I potentially overlooking?

Your insights would be invaluable in refining this tool.

Thanks for your time.
Yes, it is self promotion only if the prediction has high accuracy.

System fetches data via data and news APIs and directly from news website, twitter APIs. Total 22 APIS (8 of them are paid), 8 wesbite directly like economics time, moneycontrol, bloomberg etc.

Whole algorithm is divided into 2 parts:

1) Global events: Geo political event like anything by trup, FII, DOW jones, NASDAQ, NIKKI, other indices, negative news like wars,  crude oil, currency fluctuation etc  
  
2) Local events: Economic news, company news (app tracks Nifty top 100, indices and commodities), political news, RBI (special attention), company Quarter reports, contracts received, CEO resigned/changed/Scam, unemployment rate, interest rates, over 52 parameters from local economy. 

Every event like Quarter report, is assigned a sentiment score between 0.01-0.05, algorithm add the negative events and positive events separately and give it sentiment score, the total of sccore decide the final sentiment i.e To short or to long.

Aim is to take a trade by 9:30 and exit the market by 10 PM, irrespective of resut because when they starts more news comes in and the trend generally changes.

So I am looking to make algorithm more solid based on the factors intraday traders looks for before taking a trade. Self Promotion?. how does system work? Haha, my apologies for making you read this.

I don't go on daily results, I am looking for monthly average, between today the prediction was shared with everyone at 8:45 AM in morning ended with 80% accuracy. Once it have anything over 60% in 30 days of consistent trades, I'll share'the whole thing for free. u better start having paid users

or u r going to have lots of api burning ur cahflow You can DM me Tomorrow's Prediction..If end up in profit, 10% will be yours..

If in loss, you will apologise to me n shut this all.. https://preview.redd.it/7mbhibls68hf1.jpeg?width=2412&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9441dccbd07941ba6dd4710cd2a5a963651d0bf8

I use levels based on historical data, moving averages, fibonacci pivot levels, previous day high and lows for morning session and afternoon session. I am a developer, lemme know if you need help, sounds like a cool project to work on! (And no I won't be using your insights since I don't do intra day trading) I trade whenever I get time. If it is sideways in the morning I close early. SL 12% risk reward 1:2 followed by trailing stop loss. Green signal would favourable candlestick pattern at my indicator levels or a trendline breakout. Red flag would be buildup of chart pattern You can use ngrok tool to expose your local environment to the public for testing this will save you deployment cost.

1mhbtnk,2025-08-04,"Markets Are Fine… If You Ignore the Tariffs, Rupee Crash, FPI Exodus & SEBI Breathing Down Everyone’s Neck
US slaps 25% tariffs on our exports. Rupee chilling near ₹88. FPIs pulling out faster than retail traders after a red candle.

Nifty has been falling for five straight weeks, but “experts” say a reversal is coming on Aug 8. Yeah, sure.

Autos & metals are up, IT stocks are still in ICU. Jefferies says “neutral” now, so… still meh.

IPO mania: NSDL oversubscribed 41×, JSW Cement wants ₹3,600 crore. Listing gains gang still alive and kicking.

SEBI vs Jane Street drama unfolding, $560M frozen, “reforms” incoming. Finfluencers already typing new “safe” option strategies.

So… are we actually in trouble, or is this just another episode of “India Bulls Through Everything”?


Tariffs? Rupee crash? FPI exodus?  
Cool. Wake me up when we stop oversubscribing IPOs like free biryani. How much cash are you sitting on then? And how much % of your portfolio is shorted stocks and indices ? Market goes through a normal bullish day: Markets are solid, we are independent, retailers and dii are supporting.

Market goes through a normal bearish day: Oh my god Trump Tariffs, War, India Rupee is the worst.

Just relax and keep on investing and trading. If market is to go 0, stock market will be the last thing you care about. ![gif](giphy|gjxrPwCHWkXrWgYNua|downsized) Markets in the short term is always like a casino. Feel yourself lucky ? - go buy a single stock. >Nifty has been falling for five straight weeks, but “experts” say a reversal is coming on Aug 8. Yeah, sure.

Nifty was at 25,637 on 27 July. Where has it been falling for 5 weeks straight? And who are these experts? Got a source that says there will be a reversal? Tariff? FII? Taxes?



That was a dream bro. Get up we need to go find new berries to forage. Those black ones killed our friend yesterday exactly did this 😬

Capital Used - 6.5L 

Returns = -40k (-6.1%)

Definitely a bad month. Most of the losses were contributed by booking losses on a single investment in Triveni Eng.

Definitely should've had a tighter Sl. But even apart from this investment it was a bad month because firstly Nifty closed in red in all 4 weeks of the month.

And my trading skills aren't at the level I'll like them to be to trade effectively in a consolidating market.

Have been trying option selling on paper trade and I am starting to get an idea. Will definitely  start it with real money post my university exams.

My exams are till Sept mid so execution will be compromised in Aug and Sept. Let's see how it goes.

Yea, very difficult month. SLs were hitting left right center. I was able to turn around about 4 trades which hit full profit target so my net is still positive but not as good as I would have liked

Oh your r in options with loss...got it Bro,  focus on long term investing. Trading is very difficult NIce post im also learning how swing trading works and how should i do the investment and learn it these real world example with full details like (ur portfolio sheet, ur time line) helps me to understand many things.   
Thank you buddy :D So be it. But I love the process of trading and I am gonna master it. For trading, sl is variable based on the support levels i think from where price can rebound. If the supports get broken I then I am out.

For investing I like to take a more fundamental sl than a technical sl. Triveni announced a bad q1 results so I exited it after that. But that clearly isn't working.

I find medium term investing in way more difficult than short term trading. There are too many variable that can affect a stock in 1-2 year period. Its a full time job. You cant expect to earn serious money without putting 12-14 everyday. Are you prepared to do that? Most people get into trading because they think its easier to understand, unlike investing. And you get instant profits. People on this subreddit dont want to inderstand this. Bro that's too less, I mean the profit or loss will be miniscule. This was just a bearish month so I couldn't could trade that well. 

I've been swing trading since 2 years so I am comfortable with this position sizing.

1mfx6sc,2025-08-02,"How can one win at markets (my take)
First things first apologies for kinda click-baity heading, you can't win here as there's nothing to win at, you can just perform(better or worse) in comparison to others or instruments for a given period of time.

So let's get to that, how can one perform better than something they're taking as a benchmark for example most commonly used, major indices like Nifty 50 or Bank Nifty or maybe comparing with any trader/investor like warren buffet (sounds silly but beating his returns on huge capital is phenomenal given for such long duration).

Performing better requires one and only one thing : **Edge.**

Thing that most people don't understand and delve directly into psychology and stuff and all kinda stupid stuff out there, also paying hefty amount for it sometimes in scammy stuff. They need to understand that all they need is a Edge first and everything comes later(as you eventually keep building it from the foundation of your edge), you need to have a proven Edge first.

Now what's an edge over markets might be a logical question, that is what I'll try to layout using this post, it's the main essence of it. 

So Edge over markets means anything(Literally anything ,can also be a coin flip, if that works for you) that can help you perform consistently better in large sample set of similar scenarios when they play out, this simply means you can reap profits overtime applying that same thing again and again over a huge set of scenarios. Now you have to gain so much from this edge, that you can beat the benchmark that you've decided for yourself for a considerable amount of time in order to outperform it. 

Now depending on where you are in your life, or where you want to be you can choose or build your edge overtime to consistently perform better in markets. Let's explore some of the edges out there to get an idea of how wild can these things be.

These are out of retail domain usually : 

1. **You're Literally an insider of a company(Higher level decision making people)** : Time and time again insiders have gained from the info others are not yet aware of, this is nothing new it has been happening since the capitalism has happened, also it's one of the biggest edge out there, but illegal on paper (but people usually find ways hehe). This is the edge in purest form, kinda formidable if you know what you're doing. Know insiders and getting tips might help but it always does not turn out for the best in such cases.

2. **You're an operator in a stock :** So basically you've got a shit load of money and you're trying to manipulate stock without getting noticed or get ready for some action hahaha, it's an edge though and happens more often than not so.

3. **Quant Firm :** If you have fastest and reliable data with internet connection along side the smartest brains and math wizs who you pay so heavily to work for you 70 hours a week churning out algos and systems, well you are in to make shit ton of money eventually if you do not blow up due to a tiny mistake. 

4. **Hedge Fund or Private Equity :** You have a loads of money to manage and you take a huge cut just to keep that money from degrading, huge network for high net worth individuals pooling their money and giving it to you for you to manage, then maybe that's your edge to get good paydays. 

5. **Using drones to spy on Oil reserves and such stuff :** Self explanatory. 

And many more these kinda complicated formations, you get the drift right?

Now coming to retail division :

5. **You thew a dart** : So you've picked some 50 companies randomly and thew a dart at them and then maybe you got luck and beat the shit out of all benchmarks, highly rare and literally not recommended but can happen. Most retail do this. Also an edge if you're feeling like your luck is out of this world.

  
6. **You go YOLO options**(Even with knowledge) :  Pretty much the above one, but you'll lose your money so fast your head will start spinning and you'll be scared to look at your yearly PnL at the year end. You'll sleep good after a huge loss(personal experience, only If it was not the loan money). But some times people go on lucky streak and make money doing this, so that's an edge in that case that is your luck, just runnnnn when this happens, you don't go back to casino after you've cleared out the table.

And many more variations of this here and there you know..

Now that we've got rid of major things that would often not pan out for us then what's left for us? Let look at that :

7. **Fundamental analysis/ Value Investing**: Branch of investing/Trading that says if you can read the company statements well and all it's ongoing available stuff in news, concalls and stuff you can beat the benchmark overtime. So basically it can work for you but there's very few people who are this good at this in a long term horizon, sometimes I call it gambling if you're not knowing what you're doing and just doing half assed work to bind your money and sit for 10 years to find your that most of what you've bought got delisted or is halved.

So how people who do it efficiently work it out?

They have cornerstones to it, that might include : 

\-Right Diversification 

\-Attending/reading concalls, presentations asking right questions 

\-Have put in a slight thought on what future might look like for this company 

\-Finding objective evidences of that future happening  

\-Tracking quarterly data of company along with developing good skills at reading them

\-Might help if you can meet with promotors and have talks about future(Not for everyone)

\-Having strong instinct about something that you've expertise in and betting right amount and sit tight until everything above seems right

\-Trying it's products and getting a sense for yourself if it feels right according to your instincts on how they can grow 

\-Patience and ability to let it grow without having the dependence on the money you've put in, till your vision plays out

These are a few that I've read and experienced myself, there are gonna be more. Maybe add to it on comments? if you're this kinda Investor/Trader.

 Most people are under this perception that you have sit out for years or decades to make profit from this kinda edge, but they can't be more wrong. 

If your vision for a company plays out in a year and stock goes 10X-15X you need to know when to get out, specially if it comes very early. That's a skill that people develop overtime how to judge where we at and how are things looking forward given the current situation and its quite critical skill to develop.

Let's take a example : lets say a XYZ company trades at 100 Cr Market cap and you think this company has a exceptional product that'll mint money, you invest in it. You think that it's easy for this company to reach 2000-3000 Cr valuation in future when everything goes right for it. But some miracle happens and it reaches a valuation of 1500 Cr in just 10 months due to extraordinary scaling and boom in industry. Now you have two options 

1. Take out your major stake and leave some to see if it can go any further. As your vision has nearly played out. It's the most logical step here. Also given that the move was so rapid that it might need some time to digest some gains.

2. Being someone who thinks it can go much more cause you're greedy, but if you have some empirical evidence to back the further growth it's fine to be in it, but if not and you're just acting out on greed then it's gonna ramp down your edge significantly.

There can be multiple such scenarios that can play out, as a user of this edge you've to build competence in this areas to gain a edge overtime, also experience helps alongside good books.

As this post would get huge if I include more stuff here, will keep it for next one. If I feel people need a further post like this based on their reactions I would love to jot down the stuff in next post.

1mfgk7e,2025-08-02,"Data Centers to Become Largest Consumers of Renewable Energy in India
The country's data center capacity is expected to grow exponentially from 1.4 gigawatts in 2024 to 9 gigawatts by 2030. Currently, data centers account for approximately 2% of the country's total energy demand, but this figure is projected to rise dramatically to 6% by 2030. To put this in perspective, an average data center consumes as much power as an aluminum smelter or the equivalent of 100,000 homes. 

The artificial intelligence revolution is adding another layer of complexity to this energy equation. A single ChatGPT query uses 2.9 watt-hours of electricity compared to 0.3 watt-hours for a Google search. Goldman Sachs Research projects that AI will increase data center power consumption by 200 TWh annually between 2023 and 2030, with AI accounting for about 19% of data center power demand by 2028.

The transition to renewable energy in India's data center sector represents one of the most significant green energy opportunities in the country. The Yotta NM1 data center near Mumbai, India's largest, already gets half of its power from renewables with a target of reaching 70%. 

Despite the promising opportunities, the path to renewable energy dominance in data centers faces substantial obstacles. The intermittent nature of renewable power generation requires expensive storage solutions, creating a significant financial burden for operators. 

Infrastructure challenges are particularly acute. Power reliability varies significantly across India, with frequent disturbances forcing data centers to rely on expensive diesel generators and uninterruptible power supplies, substantially increasing operational costs. 

Electricity tariffs, including fixed charges in metropolitan areas, are among the highest in India, making power one of the biggest cost burdens for data centers.

India's hot climate increases cooling demands, making it difficult to maintain global efficiency standards for Power Usage Effectiveness. Cooling accounts for approximately 40% of a data center's electricity demand.

The massive scale of energy demand creates grid integration challenges that could undermine the renewable energy transition. Clustering of data centers in major hubs will further strain local power networks, given their enormous energy consumption.

The trajectory toward renewable energy dominance in India's data center sector appears inevitable. The market size of data centers is projected to reach 8 GW by 2025, requiring 20 GW of solar power for data centers by 2030. This represents an opportunity to create almost 12 GW of renewable and storage capacities.

The expansion beyond tier-I cities to emerging markets like Kochi, Jaipur, Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Patna, and Visakhapatnam will create new opportunities for renewable energy deployment.

https://preview.redd.it/rdx9gd931jgf1.jpg?width=945&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c726c1680a738548c777740e099f8b40815b6fe


This is both exciting and a bit concerning. On one hand, it’s great to see India’s data center growth aligning with renewable energy goals 9 GW by 2030 is massive. The fact that facilities like Yotta NM1 are already halfway powered by renewables is definitely a step in the right direction.

But the challenges are real. The infrastructure gap, unreliable power supply, high cooling demands, and insane tariffs in metro areas could slow things down. Plus, with AI blowing up energy consumption (didn’t realize a single ChatGPT query eats up 10x the power of a Google search), we’re heading into serious demand territory.

The idea of data centers becoming the biggest consumers of green energy in India is both a huge opportunity and a logistical headache. We’ll need smart grid upgrades, localized storage, and probably a major policy push to make it sustainable.

Still if we pull this off, it could turn India into a global hub for sustainable digital infrastructure. Let’s just hope the execution keeps up with the ambition. Are there any listed cooling companies in India which would get a boost from data center expansion? You can check techno electric and engineering Most infra and real estate companies are getting into this business. And companies like Castrol are getting into data center cooling business.

1mf1vts,2025-08-01,"Tanla Platforms: What's the bigger picture and the stagnant share price?
Tanla Platforms is a major player in the Communications Platform as a Service (CPaaS) sector, particularly in India.

Pros:

1. Almost 0 debt (2.8% debt equity ratio)

2. Good ROE of 28%

3. Promoter holding marginally increased from 43% to 45% over the past few quarters

4. The company's median sales growth is 26.8% over the last 10 years

Tanla is a leading CPaaS provider, dominating the market for Application-to-Person (A2P) messaging in India. It processes a significant portion of the country's A2P SMS traffic, with a market share of around 35-40%.

The company has evolved from a bulk SMS provider to a comprehensive cloud communications company. Its key product portfolio includes:

* **Trubloq:** A blockchain-based platform for Digital Ledger Technology (DLT) that is designed to combat spam and fraud in the telecom industry. It is cited as the world's largest blockchain use case.
* **Wisely:** A patented cloud communication platform built in partnership with Microsoft Azure, offering secure, real-time communication.

Tanla serves over 2,000 enterprise customers, including major players in technology (Google, Meta), e-commerce (Flipkart, Amazon), banking (HDFC, SBI), and telecom (Airtel, Jio).

While its core market is India, Tanla is actively expanding its international presence with offices in Singapore and Dubai and partnerships in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.

The company is focusing on new technologies like Rich Communication Services (RCS) and AI-driven communication solutions, such as its ""Wise Albert"" platform.

Analyst forecasts and a company-sponsored report project revenue and net income growth in the low double-digits (around 11-13%) over the next three years. This is a solid, albeit not explosive, growth rate

Despite all the pros, the company's share price is below 20 DMA and below 50 DMA. What's the view for long-term? Worth buying some shares now? Or avoid?
I like the stock.

https://preview.redd.it/pipj4jiw0ggf1.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f014f75d3b663cd3457cd3ebe83f55339f6b34d I have been following the Cpass industry for a long time. At the core they make money buy sending sms basically by buying bulk sms from telecom providers and helping the enterprises send the sms to target groups. This was a great model in the past but started having challenges recently.

1. Enterprises see sms as a old format where the communication is one sided and there is no interaction.

2. Failure of RCS. even though RCS has rich format where you can send media and links for interaction it costs more.

3. Final nail in the coffin. Meta started offering their enterprise bundle where the companies can send messages on WhatsApp which has more interactive features ( think of whatsapp banking thats how advanced it is) at a fraction of the cost.

I agree the cpass players have some clients for whatsapp advertising also but most are going directly to meta for their offerings cutting the middle man. Given all these challenges the future is not so optimistic. So there is a derating in PE from 100 to 20. It has a very debatable moat.
RCS is kinda an old tech, especially for foreign countries and couldn’t justify the ROI in past.  

I don’t see any explosive future for it.

1me5mvp,2025-07-31,"JLR CEO resigns (Tata Motors)
So the CEO of Tata Motors’s subsidiary JLR will step down amid tariff disruptions to JLR business. 

Notable that Tata Motors is planning to acquire IVECO and will have two subsidiary businesses to turn around—one each in PV and CV segments after the demerger. 

I’m aware that there’s a passionate voice on the worthlessness of Tata Motors as a company on this sub; the analysis is not entirely wrong but I am also confident that in the very long run, the companies formed from the demerger will be good companies or will be acquired by good names. 

No investment advice, just a newbie expressing confidence in a brand in doldrums :)

 
They could have waited until the deleveraging played out completely. Their cash position was definitely improving. But I don't think, going forward with something like swallowing a whole company while having sales and tariff issues is a good idea.

1mdx86a,2025-07-31,"First try at Analysing a Company | Tata Motors
# Tata Motors: Q1 FY26 Earnings Preview - A Research Report

Date: July 31, 2025  
Rating: Hold  
Tenure: long term  
Short-Term trend: bearish  
Target Price: Rs 775 - 830

**Key Hypothesis:** Tata Motors' Q1 FY26 earnings are expected to reflect a challenging quarter primarily due to softer global wholesales, partially offset by strategic focus on higher-margin models (especially JLR) and a resilient domestic EV segment. While profitability may see a contraction YoY, the long-term outlook remains supported by EV growth initiatives and cost optimization efforts.

# 1. Sales Performance Overview (Q1 FY26 vs. Q1 FY25)

|Metric|Q1 FY26 (Units)|Q1 FY25 (Units)|YoY Change (%)|Remarks|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Total Global Wholesales**|2,99,664|3,29,292|\-9%|Overall volume contraction globally.|
|**Domestic Sales**|2,03,411|2,26,012|\-10%|Reflects subdued demand in the Indian market.|
|**Passenger Vehicles (incl. EVs)**|1,24,809|1,38,677|\-10%|Despite overall decline, EV sales show late-quarter momentum. New launches like Tiago (up 16% YoY) and Altroz/Harrier-EV are positive.|
|**Commercial Vehicles**|85,606|91,048|\-6%|Modest decline in the commercial segment.|
|**JLR Wholesales**|87,286|98,060|\-11%|Volume drop, but a strategy shift towards higher-margin models is crucial.|
|**Jaguar Wholesales**|2,339|N/A|N/A|Specific decline for Jaguar, indicating ongoing model transitions.|
|**Land Rover Wholesales**|84,947|N/A|N/A|Land Rover remains the dominant segment within JLR.|
|**JLR Retail Sales (incl. China JV)**|94,420|111,260|\-15.1%|Larger retail sales decline compared to wholesales for JLR.|

**Hypothesis:** The notable decline in overall wholesales, particularly in domestic and JLR segments, is expected to be a primary drag on top-line growth. However, strategic moves within JLR to prioritize higher-margin models (like Range Rover, comprising 77.2% of wholesales vs. 67.8% YoY) are anticipated to provide some cushion against the volume decline, preventing a steeper revenue drop.

# 2. Expected Financial Metrics (Q1 FY26 Projections)

|Financial Metric|Projection (Q1 FY26)|YoY Change (%)|Underlying Rationale / Drivers|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Revenue**|Rs 1,00,000-1,05,000 crore|\-5% to -8%|Despite a 9% drop in global volumes, JLR's enhanced product mix (higher ASPs, especially in the Range Rover family) and improved regional performance in some markets (e.g., MENA +20.5%, China +1%) are expected to partially offset the volume impact, leading to a less severe revenue decline.|
|**Net Profit**|Rs 4,000-5,500 crore|\-10% to -20%|Lower sales volumes directly translate to reduced profitability. Additionally, elevated material costs (estimated at \~68% of expenses) are likely to compress margins. The full impact of volume contraction will be felt here.|
|**EBITDA Margin**|11-12%|Down \~350 bps|This projection factors in estimated EBITDA margins for JLR at \~11.4%, which is supported by an 8% sequential rise in Average Selling Prices (ASPs). While JLR's performance is a bright spot, the overall decline in sales and persistent cost pressures across the board are expected to drag down the consolidated EBITDA margin significantly compared to the prior year.|
|**EPS**|Rs 10-14|N/A|Directly linked to the net profit outlook. A lower profit base will naturally lead to a reduced EPS.|

**Hypothesis:** While revenue decline is expected to be managed somewhat by JLR's premium strategy, the impact on the bottom line (Net Profit and EBITDA margins) will be more pronounced. This suggests that despite efforts, the current quarter faces significant headwinds from both volume and cost perspectives.

# 3. Potential Influences & Risks

|Category|Factor|Impact Direction|Explanation|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Positive Catalysts**|Growth in Electric Vehicles (EVs)|Positive|Tata Motors' aggressive push for EV penetration (aiming for 30% by FY30) is a key long-term growth driver. While Q1 FY26 EV sales are part of a declining PV segment, the momentum towards quarter-end suggests potential for improved performance in subsequent quarters, contingent on continued consumer adoption and product pipeline strength.|
||Cost-Takeout Measures|Positive|Ongoing internal cost optimization initiatives across all segments could provide a buffer against rising material costs and contribute to margin improvement over time. Any positive updates on this front would be welcome.|
||Regional Gains (e.g., MENA, China)|Positive|Strong performance in specific international markets (MENA up 20.5%, China up 1% for JLR) highlights diversified revenue streams and could partially mitigate weakness in core markets.|
|**Headwinds / Risks**|Subdued Indian Demand|Negative|Macroeconomic factors such as persistent inflation and unpredictable monsoon patterns could continue to dampen consumer sentiment and spending on discretionary items like vehicles, impacting domestic sales volumes.|
||Global Economic Slowdowns (EU/US)|Negative|Economic contractions or slowdowns in key international markets (Europe, the US) could further impact JLR's performance and overall global wholesales.|
||Debt Levels (Post-Iveco Acquisition)|Negative|The proposed $4.5 billion Iveco acquisition raises concerns about increased debt burden, potentially impacting the company's financial flexibility and interest expenses in the future. Investors will be keenly watching for updates on this front and its potential implications.|
||Operating Leverage from New Facilities|Mixed|While new facilities can lead to economies of scale and efficiency in the long run, in the short term, they might incur initial costs and underutilization if demand remains subdued, impacting profitability.|
||JLR Model Transitions|Mixed|The ongoing phasing out of legacy Jaguar models is a necessary strategic move, but it can temporarily impact volume. The success of new model introductions and their ramp-up will be crucial to offset this.|

**Hypothesis:** While Tata Motors has strategic avenues for long-term growth (EVs, JLR's premium focus), the immediate quarter faces a challenging demand environment both domestically and globally. The market will be looking for clear commentary on cost control, debt management (especially related to the Iveco deal), and the outlook for key segments like EVs and JLR's new model pipeline to assess future trajectory.

**Disclaimer:** *These projections and analyses are based on publicly available pre-earnings data as of July 31, 2025, and market consensus. Actual results may differ. Investing in equities carries inherent risks, and past performance is not indicative of future results.*

Before anybody mentions: Yes, I did use AI & Grammarly to improve the data presentation and language, but data accumulation, hypothesis formation, and analysis were done by me.

\> Please suggest if you think I can improve this in any way. I would appreciate it if you could guide me instead of criticising, as I am learning. I want to understand if I misunderstood the data, left something out of the picture, or formed a premature bias against the stock/company.

Also, I am not an advisor in any way, so take everything with a spoonful of salt. I am just a guy with a laptop and a curious mind.
The analysis has fundamental flaws. You should first focus on analysing the industry structure before screening the stocks. 

Second, compare it with not only domestic peers but also the international peers and their growth rates to figure out whether it’s a value buy or trap. 

Key Financial parameters like ROCE, Margins profile whether its expanding or not  should be observed and rate of reinvestment should be monitored. 

Revenue profile, Moat structures, erosion of their EV advantages in India all are getting reflected in financial language of company. 

So avoid this company even at these multiples because long term they will give less than 10% for the next decade on any financial model.


You will learn this as you develop your knowledge base, because No AI will be able to help you figure out these patterns. 

Learn through books, the use AI as a tool, but don’t depend on it to screen or analyse the stocks. *Please suggest if you think I can improve this in any way. I would appreciate it if you could guide me instead of criticising, as I am learning.*

Don't use AI in the beginning. If you use, you cannot develop own analysis. Thank you for the insightful review. I will make a mental note of this.

1mdsfhb,2025-07-31,"India shall take tough stance on Tariffs against USA. It has nothing to loose.
India should analyse How USA based companies generating profits from India!


* By banning global giants like Alibaba, PDD, Tencent, Huawei, TikTok so on, India gave monopoly access to USA based tech giants like Amazon, Meta, Apple.

* USA companies like Nike, Crocs, Levi’s, Sketchers so on importing goods from China and selling in India. Out of this profit goes to their USA shareholders. Who will account this trade deficit?

* Companies like McDonalds, Domino’s, Pizza hut, Burger King so on imports many ingredients from other countries than USA. That they feeding Indian consumers. Out of that they making profits. Who will account this trade deficit?


If Trump is counting then India shall also account “USA specific companies Import to India from other than USA countries “!
Even flipkart is owned by Walmart. US sellers in India are required to establish and Indian entity and pay taxes to the indian government - federal, state, and local. 

Indians companies like Jubiliant foodworks, hardcastle, connaught, yum foods, and devyani run Dominos, Mcd, and KFC franchises in India. The same applies to Coke and Pepsi. It's never a one way street. 

You may now get back to seething and coping. Let's start by banning these US tech companies but first create an alternative? Or let indian entrepreneurs thrive. That would be massive boost in economy. We have our IT service industry to loose, our major export to US is not goods but service, which is more than 100bn dollar...IF EU also aligned with US, than definitely pressure can be created on USA... Most importantly indian subsidiaries of these US tech giants. Those are responsible for high salaries. Indian tech companies used to pay peanuts 10 years ago. Trump is doing the right thing. BRICS should accelerate cooperation between asia and the global south. BRICScoin can unleash the potential of 70% of global workforce. If our IT companies are banned from doing business with US, imagine the effect on jobs here. Food companies use local ingredients. Food imports are prohibitively expensive. 

Apparel manufacturers use a mix of Indian, SE asian, and Bangladesh goods. 

Yes, they send profits back to their US HQ.

If you think that's a problem, wait until every nation does this to India. Say good bye to IT, petrochem, pharma, textiles, engineering goods. 

Please pick up a newspaper and read consistently for months, and you will realize we live in shitty market and there are largely 2 reasons behind retail participation being high: a. high fees and duties to send money abroad, b. mindless SIP investing. Due to my employment, I invest in shares on NASDAQ and the growth is tremendous. Nothing on the BSE/NSE matches that.

India sucks at trade because of its lack of quality goods, policies, and logistics. It should take accountability and improve itself instead of hating and blaming others. Exactly. IT is already in crisis. Add this to turmoil. You'll create a Army of unemployed youth even the skilled youths will go jobless.

1mcy409,2025-07-30,"Struggling with Trading Addiction – Need Advice
Hi everyone,

I’ve been a long-term investor since 2021. I always make it a point to check fundamentals and invest in quality stocks for the long run. But despite that disciplined approach, I’ve made some serious mistakes when it comes to **options trading**.

Earlier this year, after the market recovery in April, I started trading options — without much knowledge or a proper strategy. At first, I was up by around ₹4.5 lakhs. But then, everything spiralled. One day, driven by revenge trading, I lost ₹12 lakhs in a single session. My actual capital was just ₹2 lakhs; the rest was pledged against my stock holdings. It was a devastating loss.

Recently, with recession fears in the air, I took another shot at options and surprisingly recovered around ₹10 lakhs. So technically, I’m down only ₹2 lakhs now, a loss I can accept. But the **real issue is addiction**.

Every morning, I feel a strong urge to open the market, check Nifty, and place a small bet, usually just one lot. I tell myself it’s harmless, but the emotional toll is immense. I can't focus until the trade turns green. My stress levels spike, and I can feel my body heat up while waiting.

The irony? My overall stock portfolio is in the green, built on solid fundamentals. Yet I keep falling into this cycle of stress-driven intraday trades. Deep down, I know that if I don’t get this under control, I could end up wiping out everything again.

  
**Should I just uninstall all trading apps for now and stick to SIPs until I regain emotional discipline?**

Has anyone else faced something similar? I’d appreciate your thoughts on how to break this loop and avoid emotional trading.

Thanks for reading.

Losing 12 and gaining 10 immediately is a big ego booster, I'd avoid trading for a while atleast Invest in mfs and forget Uninstall the apps. 

There is mo better way. I belive in out of sight out of mind philosophy. Invest all the amount you can via MFs, uninstall all the trading apps from phone, and only do investing via desktop. If you have excess money that you don't want to invest in MFs, do a fixed deposit. Have only the amount that you need for your monthly needs. Bro that's the only feasible option you have now. stick to SIPs only. I deleted all the broker apps disable the FnO segment. keep it only for equity segment This is also known as gambling. I would go to gamblers anonymous to help with the addiction. And delete all trading apps and invest only in FDs, mutual funds and ETFs. Forget stocks forever - in any shape or form. With ETFs you get all the benefits of buying stocks with none of the spiralling into addiction. I’m not saying leave. Don’t sell anything. Just stop watching them and stop trading any further in stocks. Forget the investments for now. Focus on savings, SIPs, and building long term value with a 10-15 year holding outlook. Hire a broker, like over the phone one, uninstall all apps, replace with another hobby/ learn some new instrument/ language",17,0.96,21,0,Veno0058,IndianStockMarket,['CCEP'],struggling trading addiction need advice hi everyone ive longterm investor since 2021 always make point check fundamentals invest quality stocks long run despite disciplined approach ive made serious mistakes comes options trading earlier year market recovery april started trading options without much knowledge proper strategy first around 45 lakhs everything spiralled one day driven revenge trading lost 12 lakhs single session actual capital 2 lakhs rest pledged stock holdings devastating loss recently recession fears air took another shot options surprisingly recovered around 10 lakhs technically im 2 lakhs loss accept real issue addiction every morning feel strong urge open market check nifty place small bet usually one lot tell harmless emotional toll immense cant focus trade turns green stress levels spike feel body heat waiting irony overall stock portfolio green built solid fundamentals yet keep falling cycle stressdriven intraday trades deep know dont get control could end wiping everything uninstall trading apps stick sips regain emotional discipline anyone else faced something similar id appreciate thoughts break loop avoid emotional trading thanks reading gifgiphyxt8qbu0jufpncxuup2downsized losing 12 gaining 10 immediately big ego booster id avoid trading atleast invest mfs forget uninstall apps mo better way belive sight mind philosophy invest amount via mfs uninstall trading apps phone investing via desktop excess money dont want invest mfs fixed deposit amount need monthly needs bro thats feasible option stick sips deleted broker apps disable fno segment keep equity segment also known gambling would go gamblers anonymous help addiction delete trading apps invest fds mutual funds etfs forget stocks forever shape form etfs get benefits buying stocks none spiralling addiction im saying leave dont sell anything stop watching stop trading stocks forget investments focus savings sips building long term value 1015 year holding outlook hire broker like phone one uninstall apps replace another hobby learn new instrument language

1mc1vfd,2025-07-29,"So what's going on with this stock (ISWL)
I'm an amateur so this might be a stupid question so forgive me in advance.

Someone I know purchased stocks in ISWL some months ago on the recommendation of a stock market analyser. They've asked me to help them understand this stocks behaviour.

For the past ~10 days Indian Steel Works LTD (BSE) has been hitting and staying at upper circuitfor the full day. I haven't been able to find any significant news in the past 3 weeks on Google that would justify the stock price rising so much so rapidly. From what I can understand the company financials aren't so great either. Looking at the market depth, 25 orders driving 850k shares at maximum price also feels odd, especially considering that there are 0 sell orders.

Is my speculation correct that this stock price is being artificially inflated for a possible pump and dump bid? My friend wants to sell away his shares but a mutual of ours told him to wait a bit and see if he can squeeze out a bit more profit out of it. I feel like it's risky, since we don't exactly know what direction this stock will take at what time. Plus, this stock is also under SEBI watch of some sort so I'm concerned that they might stop the trade if suspicious activity is found, and my friend will lose his money.

Thank you in advance.

1may3kd,2025-07-27,"18.5% LTCG incoming
The recently proposed legislation aims to augment the long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax levied on limited liability partnerships (LLPs) from 12.5% to 18.5%, employing the alternative minimum tax (AMT). This provision directly impacts the following entities: Family offices Promoter holding firms LLPs utilized as investment vehicles These structures were meticulously designed to optimize tax compliance. However, this proposed change may render these strategies obsolete. The primary objective of this legislation is not tax planning; rather, it serves as a measure to mitigate potential tax liabilities.
Bruh, consider mentioning ""for LLP""s in the Post name I got click baited twice, thanks

1m9n67w,2025-07-26,"How I gradually made 1-Lakh ( 100% ) profit out of iPO Shuffling.
In this screenshot I have shown how I gradually made 100% profit out of IPO in 1-year from June-2023 to may-2024 in Retail segment.

Later I stopped because of low allotment chances, more demat AC requirements & funds were diverted.

🚴started june-23 under 'company name' you can see i Invested in these 28 in 1 year. Used to skip the one which I didn't felt confident.

📊 The Strategy was simple I new that in retail segment oversubscription wouldn't exceed 4-7x, if (GMP is 20-50%)
(Issue size 500-800cr) & (Shares offered is 35%). On an average i used to apply with 5-7 demat AC, 2 A/c were mine others are of my friends I used to give them funds to invest in IPOs in return I provided them fixed commission pretty cool deal.

💸In further columns those are Gain & loss. Losses were small profits were huge. Under investment column those are the maximum investment which I made per IPO. Used to invest heavily where oversubscription were 100%. Beside it I have noted some data points of every IPO later on i stopped reporting it.


🔥In the month of Nov i made almost 45k. Tata tech was purely luck based 😅 wasn't expected, booked 170% gains. After that every Indian flocked to IPO markets IREDA,TATA were making headlines. Even on a decent IPO oversubscriptions in retail segments were going crazy 8-12X whereas HNI category was normal. Allotment chances got harder and harder to counter that I planned to add more no. Of demat A/c. But that also didn't worked coz
 subscription went 15-18x. Me and our traders friends were eagerly waiting for that 1 bad IPO.   So these new entrants could get a lesson.

🥳Nonetheless I made 1.30 L  from IPO shuffling & another 15k from investments leftover in IPO stock later sold at profit. Around 20k invested.

Feel free to ask anything...!

Wait how can you apply with two Demat Acs, applying with two Demat accounts in your name doesn't get you subscription moreover it is a Fraud u/s 447 as in Section 38 of the companies Act 2013
Making multiple Applications to increase chance of IPO is a Fraud.
And everyone who abets you in making Multiple Applications is also guilty of fraud.
Not a good decision to put this on Social Media
Though applying in IPOs I don't consider it a flex 😂 Oh, absolutely! Because of him, I missed out on every IPO allotment and watched him rake in the profits like a lottery winner! Ah, I see. I don't understand how OP received allotments on applying 2 applications using his own demat. The registrar would have (should have) rejected both applications because the rule is one PAN, one application in applying for issues. 🥲 mine means family member ,sister bro. We hv a separate portfolio of parent company stocks for IPO 😅
